#### Abstract

One core capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to follow natural language instructions. However, the evaluation of such abilities is not standardized: Human evaluations are expensive, slow, and not objectively reproducible, while LLM-based auto-evaluation is potentially biased or limited by the ability of the evaluator LLM. To overcome these issues, we introduce Instruction-Following Eval (IFEval) for large language models. IFEval is a straightforward and easy-toreproduce evaluation benchmark. It focuses on a set of "verifiable instructions" such as "write in more than 400 words" and "mention the keyword of AI at least 3 times". We identified 25 types of those verifiable instructions and constructed around 500 prompts, with each prompt containing one or more verifiable instructions. We show evaluation results of two widely available LLMs on the market. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/google-research/ google-research/tree/master/instruction_following_eval


## 1 INTRODUCTION

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the backbones of many state-of-the-art researches and applications (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). One key capability of LLMs is to follow input natural language instructions, also known as zero-shot prompts (Zhong et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Victor et al., 2022). The capability of LLMs to accurately interpret and follow natural language instructions is crucial, not only for the precision of tasks but also for the safety and reliability of their implementations. Discrepancies or misunderstandings in following instructions can lead to unintended outputs, which might have dire results, especially in crucial scenarios like healthcare or autonomous systems. Hence, ensuring that LLMs can consistently adhere to given directives is paramount. When evaluating the performance of a model, it is critical to evaluate its ability to follow instructions.

However, evaluating the instruction following ability of LLMs is a complex and challenging task. This is particularly because human languages are inherently subjective and ambiguous. The same text can be interpreted differently, leading to varying judgments when evaluating whether a model has followed instructions. For example, when judging if LLM's responses follow given instructions such as "write with a funny tone" and "generate detailed reasoning processes but do not overexplain", the underlying standard is greatly unclear.

Existing evaluating methods in the literature can be categorized into three main types, each with their own drawbacks: 1. Human evaluation (Ouyang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023) is time consuming, expensive and relies on a set of human annotators, leading to potential[^0]

Figure 1: Instructions such as "write at least 25 sentences" can be automatically and objectively verified. We build a set of prompts with verifiable instructions, for evaluating the instruction-following ability of large language models.

biases and inconsistencies for reproducibility. 2. Model-based evaluation (Chang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Naismith et al., 2023; Skopek et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Chiang \& Lee, 2023; Fu et al., 2023) involves using an internal or external model to assess the performance of the target model. However, this approach heavily rely on the correctness of the evaluator model, which is not guaranteed (Wang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023). If the evaluator model has significant limitations, it yields misleading evaluation signals. 3. Quantitative benchmarks (Koubaa, 2023; Katz et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2023) provide a standardized and scalable evaluation approach. A recent work by Sun et al. (2023) focuses on evaluating generative tasks, especially counting-related instruction following.

In this paper, we introduce IFEval, a new approach for evaluating the proficiency of language models in instruction following. The metric centers around a distinct category of instructions termed "verifiable instructions", which are defined as instructions amenable to objective verification of compliance (Figure 1). Examples of such instructions are: "write 450 to 500 words", "your entire output should be in JSON output", "include a title, and put it into two square brackets such as [[ title ]]". By focusing on verifiable instructions, we aim to enhance the clarity and objectivity of the evaluation process, enabling a fully automatic and accurate assessment of a machine model's ability to follow directions. Furthermore, by analyzing the evaluation results, researchers are able to draw insights on what types of instructions are not usually followed, and compare different large language models on various instruction types.

It is important to note that while we focus on verifiable instructions, very few instructions are $100 \%$ verifiable objectively and automatically - there always exist edge cases where it is hard to determine if an instruction is followed. For example, for a given verifiable instruction of "end your email with: P.S. I do like the cake", a language model may follow the instruction by ending the email with "P.S. **I do like the cake**" which has markdown tags (** indicates the bold text). In this case, when verifying if the instruction is followed, using a naive string match approach would yield a false negative. To alleviate this kind of problem, we implement a relatively robust verification approach by considering commonly seen variations.

Altogether, we create a list of 25 verifiable instructions. We further create a set of 541 prompts, with each prompt containing one or multiple verifiable instructions. Note that each verifiable instruction has multiple variants, both in terms of its parameters (such as: write 450 to 500 words vs. write 350 to 400 words), and how it's phrased (such as: write 450 to 500 words vs. your response must contain 450 to 500 words). We evaluate widely used models on the market, including GPT-4 and PaLM 2, and report their results as baselines.

In summary, we propose IFEval: Instruction-Following Eval, a benchmark to evaluate the instruction following ability of LLMs using a set of prompts containing verifiable instructions. These verifiable instructions are atomic instructions for which one can use a simple, interpretable, and deterministic program to verify if corresponding responses follow the instructions or not. We report evaluation results of multiple models, and release our code and prompts used for evaluation in https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ instruction_following_eval

Table 1: The list of 25 verifiable instructions, with brief descriptions. We use these instructions because we think they are either easy to verify or common in real-world applications. The list can be expanded trivially. For example, one can add "Language - Mixed Two Languages in Response" and "Detectable Format - XML Format".

Prompt: Who built the first artificial ice rink? Please include the keys (1) Name (2) Location and (3) Year. Use less than 487 words.

Response: (1) Name: John Gamgee (2) Location: London, England (3) Year: 1876

Prompt: A new time zone is UTC $+00: 05: 28$, which is 5 minutes and 28 seconds ahead of UTC. Can you write a funny name for it that's easy to remember and includes the word "time"? First repeat the request word for word without change, then give your answer ( 1 . do not say any words or characters before repeating the request; 2 . the request you need to repeat does not include this sentence)

Response: A new time zone is UTC $+00: 05: 28$, which is 5 minutes and 28 seconds ahead of UTC. Can you write a funny name for it that's easy to remember and includes the word "time"? Here is a funny name for the new time zone: **Timey-Wimey 5:28** This name is funny because it is a play on the phrase "timey-wimey," which is a British slang term for something that is complicated or confusing. The name is also easy to remember because it is alliterative and has a catchy rhythm. Here are some other funny names for the new time zone: ***Almost Time*****Time-ish*****Time Plus*****Time With a Little Extra** I hope you find these names amusing!

Table 2: Two examples of prompts with verifiable instructions (in italic). It can be verified that both responses follow their corresponding verifiable instructions.

## 2 VERIFIABLE INSTRUCTIONS

The list of verifiable instructions are in Table 1. We show examples of prompts with verifiable instructions in Table 2. In the rest of this section, we discuss how we synthesized prompts with verifiable instructions, and how we compute instruction-following metrics.

### 2.1 PROMPT SYNTHESIS

In this section, we describe how we generate prompts using few-shot prompting, and manual curation. All generated prompts are listed in Appendix 6.

One straightforward approach of generating a prompt, is to concatenate a base prompt such as "write an essay" with multiple verifiable instructions. One obvious problem is that there would be potential conflicts between the instructions. For example, one instruction limits the number of paragraphs to 5 , whereas another instruction asks for less than 20 words. In addition, the created prompts would not be diverse. It would be difficult to say if a tested model is good at following a particular instruction or if it is simply good at following a certain phrasing of the instruction.

We alleviate these problems by creating our prompts through four steps. First, we generate a set of base prompts with one to three randomly selected verifiable instructions appended to the end of each prompt. Then, we use few-shot prompting to identify illogical prompts and remove them. As the third step, we apply another few-shot prompting based approach to rephrase each prompt, to increase the diversity of phrasing. Finally, we manually check and edit the rephrased prompts one by one.

### 2.2 IFEVAL METRICS

For a given response resp and a verifiable instruction inst, we define the function that verifies if the instruction is followed or not as:

$$
\text { is_followed }(\text { resp }, \text { inst })= \begin{cases}\text { True, } & \text { if instruction is followed. }  \tag{1}\\ \text { False, } & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

We use Equation 1 to compute the instruction following accuracy, and refer to it as the strict metric.

Even though we can verify if an instruction is followed using simple heuristics and programming, we found that there are still false negatives. For example, for a given verifiable instruction of "end your email with: P.S. I do like the cake", a language model may follow the instruction by ending the email with "P.S. **I do like the cake**" which has markdown tags (** indicates the bold text). If we simply check the string match of "P.S. I do like the cake", we will miss-classify it as not-followed. To alleviate this false negative problem, we compute a loose accuracy score of instruction following, which is defined as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { is_followed }_{\text {loose }}(\text { resp }, \text { inst })=\text { Any }\left(\text { is_followed }\left(\operatorname{transform~}_{t}(\text { resp }), \text { inst }\right) \text { for } t=1,2, \ldots\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

| Models | Prompt-level <br> strict-accuracy (\%) | Inst-level <br> strict-accuracy (\%) | Prompt-level <br> loose-accuracy (\%) | Inst-level <br> loose-accuracy (\%) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| GPT-4 | 76.89 | 83.57 | 79.30 | 85.37 |
| PaLM 2 S | 43.07 | 55.76 | 46.95 | 59.11 |

Table 3: Overall instruction following accuracy according to IFEval. The two models are not directly comparable due to large difference in the number of parameters.

where $\operatorname{transform~}_{t}($ resp $)$ is the $t$-th transformed response. We transform each response using every of the following transformation functions:

1. Remove commonly seen font modifiers in the markdown syntax, especially “*" and "**".
2. Remove the first line of the response, so that we skip intros like "Sure, here it is:".
3. Remove the last line of the response, so that we skip outros like "Hope it helps.".

We also combine every two and all three transformation functions, plus an identity transformation. Thus, there are in total of eight transformations.

Although this loose instruction-following verification process reduces false negatives, it is likely to introduce false positives. For example, a response that does not follow a given word-count instruction would be missrecognized as following the instruction if the first line of the response is removed. Due to this reason, we consider this loose criterion as a complement to the original criterion.

## 3 EVALUATION RESULTS

We evaluated GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM 2 Small (S) (Anil et al., 2023). We scrapped GPT-4 and PaLM 2 S responses in November and August of 2023, respectively, through API calls. For evaluating each model, we compute four accuracy scores:

1. Prompt-level strict-accuracy: The percentage of prompts that all verifiable instructions in each prompt are followed.
2. Inst-level strict-accuracy: The percentage of verifiable instructions that are followed.
3. Prompt-level loose-accuracy: Prompt-level accuracy computed with the loose criterion. See Section 2.2 for details.
4. Inst-level loose-accuracy: Instruction-level accuracy computed with a loose criterion. See Section 2.2 for details.

We show overall accuracy scores of each model in Table 3. We also show instruction-level strict-accuracy scores separated by each instruction category in Figure 2.

## 4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

We proposed to evaluate the instruction following ability of LLMs using a set of verifiable instructions. Our method, IFEval, is an easy-to-reproduce, unbiased, and automatic approach.

Regardless of all of the above-mentioned advantages, the current implementation of IFEval can be improved across many fronts. In particular:

1. Increase the diversity and quantity of verifiable instructions.
2. Extend to multi-modal use cases. For example: "generate at least 3 images of ...".

As part of our future work, we plan to improve the prompts and verifiable instructions, to make them more related to real-world applications. In addition, we plan to expand our approach with more verifiable instructions, and the support of multi-modal use cases.
