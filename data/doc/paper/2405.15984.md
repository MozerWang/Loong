#### Abstract

With the emergence of large language models, such as LLaMA and OpenAI GPT-3, In-Context Learning (ICL) gained significant attention due to its effectiveness and efficiency. However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, and verbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. Retrieval-Augmented ICL methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract semantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields more accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial attacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved data, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models can enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL with a $4.87 \%$ reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit overconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a $2 \%$ increase in ASR for demonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness of ICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be too costly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effective trainingfree adversarial defence method, $D A R D$, which enriches the example pool with those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements in performance and robustness, achieving a $15 \%$ reduction in ASR over the baselines. Code and data are released to encourage further research ${ }^{1}$.


## 1 Introduction

Large Language models (LLMs) are revolutionising the field of NLP (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). However, this also raises concerns about their robustness and trustworthiness. Although significant efforts are put into aligning LLMs for safety purposes, recent works still show LLMs can be vulnerable to adversarial inputs and jailbreaking (Zou et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b; Zeng et al., 2024). As a result, it is essential to understand LLM security properties to guide the direction of LLMs that are secure and robust. In this paper, we focus on examining a common LLM inference method, namely In-Context Learning (ICL) and its variants, on how they might be susceptible to perturbations and their robustness against adversarial attacks.

ICL is a common few-shot training method for prompting LLM for downstream tasks (Brown et al., 2020). Its variants include retrieval-based ICL models, which utilise retrievers to identify similar examples as demonstrations (Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023); or $k N N-I C L$, which compute label demonstrations using a nearest neighbours algorithm; have been adopted and shown promising performance improvements when compared to vanilla ICL (Shi et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023a). However, the robustness of these methods against adversarial attacks received less attention and remains unclear. Prior work-which we review in Section 2-shows that LLMs can still be vulnerable to different types of input perturbations, such as task instructions (Zhu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023) or inputs (Wang[^0]et al., 2023a); however, the robustness of ICL-based methods to such perturbations is still under-explored.

We address (in Section 4) the following question: How sensitive are vanilla and retrieval-based ICL methods to perturbations to their test samples or demonstration instances, which is particularly important given that the primary motivation of ICL is to facilitate few-shot learning without training; should any methods exhibit excessive sensitivity, this would limit their applicability. To investigate this problem, we employ commonly used perturbation attacks-namely character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. Furthermore, we propose new attack methods that target the demonstration instances and datastore examples. Our findings indicate that retrieval-based ICL methods show greater robustness against test-sample attacks; however, they can be more vulnerable when their demonstrations are adversarially perturbed. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that this vulnerability to adversarial attacks persists in newer models, such as Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) and Gemma (Gemma Team et al., 2024). Many of these attacks can be transferable, both from the same family (LLaMA-2-7B $\rightarrow$ LLaMA-2-13B, 70B) or different family (LLaMA-2-7B $\rightarrow$ Mistral-7B). We showed Mixture of Expert (MoE) models still posed a similar adversarial threat to its dense version. This encourages further investigation on enhancing model robustness.

We further explore the advantages of utilising retrieval-based models to improve robustness (in Section 5), considering that existing defence strategies often rely on an adversarial training process (Li et al., 2021; Si et al., 2021). However, this process is memory intensive in the context of LLMs. Instead, we show that retrieval-based ICL methods, combined with adversarially augmented examples, yield more robust results than no augmentation methods while maintaining their predictive accuracy on in-distribution evaluation sets. Therefore, we propose DARD, a training-free adversarial defence method which leverages adversarially perturbed samples to augment the retrieval pools, potentially improving the models' robustness. The paper is summarized in the Figure 1.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows.

- We first perform a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation on variants of ICL: vanilla, $k N N-I C L$, and retrieval-based ICL methods against Test-Sample, Demonstration and Datastore Adversarial Attacks.
- We show that Retrieval-based models can bring positive results on robustness when test samples are under adversarial attack, but it further reduces the robustness while demonstrations are perturbed. We show these attacks persist on larger models and are transferable.
- We propose DARD, a novel training-free adversarial defence method which leverages adversarially perturbed examples to improve the robustness.


## 2 Related Work

Adversarial attack and defences Adversarial attack has always been a topic in deep neural networks, where previous works showed neural networks can be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are crafted by adding imperceptible but adversarial noise on natural examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Evtimov et al., 2017). In the real world, adversarial robustness is important for the application of a method (Tram√®r et al., 2017).

Several works studied this problem and the main finding is that LMs struggle to answer correctly and factually under attacks and propose their defence via label smoothing or prompt tuning (Yang et al., 2022; Raman et al., 2023). It is important to note, however, that these experiments were mainly conducted using relatively small LMs such as BERT, RoBERTa. Recently, several works demonstrated LLM can still be vulnerable to these type of attacks, by showing the vulnerability of attacking the task instructions (PromptBench (Zhu et al., 2023)), or perform adversarial attacks on zero-shot settings and investigate the transferability of attacks from open-sourced models (i.e. Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)) to close-sourced (i.e. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) (DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023a)). However, previous study (Gu et al., 2022) has shown that the LLMs are less sensitive to prompt / instruction variation when few-shot examples are provided in context (a.k.a ICL). However, there is still a lack of systematic analysis on this case

which is the main contribution of this paper. Wang et al. (2023b) shows that attacking demonstrations can still be an effective way for adversarial attacks where LLMs are still vulnerable. Therefore, we aim to extend and evaluate the adversarial attack and defence performance on retrieval-based models.

ICL Sensitivity The existing literature on ICL analysis can be broadly divided into two streams, each focusing on different aspects. The first stream explores the influencing factors of ICL based on input perturbation, such as the order (Min et al., 2022), the formatting (Yoo et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) and the selection of the demonstration (Liu et al., 2022). Designing proper demonstration construction strategies (Ye et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) could bring clear boosts to the ICL performance, while Chen et al. (2023) analyses the sensitivity of ICL via perturb on instructions and example ordering, and our work is a complement of their work on sensitivity.

This paper provides a different view of when different ICL methods fail and when retrievalbased ICL can be a better approach for robustness.

Retrieval-based LLM Retrieval-based LLM has shown great success in lifting LLM performance and faithfulness and reducing hallucination, where the idea is to gather related articles or demonstrations from a collection of data. Specifically, we are interested in whether they can be used to improve the robustness against perturbations (Lin \& Lee, 2024). Meanwhile, many papers also focus on analysing the robustness of RAG methods on irrelevant contexts (Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024), in which we adopt similar methods in our context for analysing how retrieval-based ICL being sensitive to irrelevant contexts.

## 3 Problem Formulation

### 3.1 Background

In this work, we consider several types of ICL methods, namely Vanilla ICL, and two types of retrieval-based ICL: kNN-ICL (Xu et al., 2023a) and Retrieval-based ICL (Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023). Retrieval-based ICL methods demonstrated promising perfor-
mance improvements over vanilla ICL ones; however, their robustness against adversarial perturbations remains unexplored.

Vanilla ICL is the most commonly used few-shot learning method in LLM. Given a training data set $\mathcal{T}=\left\{\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)\right\}$, where $x_{i} \in X$ denote the instances and $y_{i} \in Y$ represent their labels, the concatenation of the $k$-shot input-label pairs is used to generate the prompt $P$ with respect to a test instance $x_{\text {test }}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
P=\mathcal{I} \oplus \pi\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right) \oplus \pi\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right) \oplus \cdots \oplus \pi\left(x_{k}, y_{k}\right) \oplus \pi\left(x_{\text {test }}, *\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{I}$ denotes the task instructions, $\pi$ denotes the templates and verbaliser to turn inputs into prompts (details for each dataset are in Appendix A.2), $\oplus$ is a concatenation operator, and $|Y|$ is the number of distinct labels. The label prediction $y_{\text {test }}$ for the test instance $x_{\text {test }}$ is then computed as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
y_{\text {test }}=\arg \max _{y \in Y} p\left(y \mid P ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

$k \mathbf{N N}$-Prompting was first introduced by Shi et al. (2022) to perform zero-shot inference and extended in later work by $\mathrm{Xu}$ et al. (2023a) to support few-shot inferences, simulating the ICL. Throughout the paper, we follow the implementation of Xu et al. (2023a) and call it $k \mathrm{NN}$-ICL. The idea is to map each training instance into a latent representation using a LLM and cache the last token distribution into a datastore. At inference time, the prediction is based on the interpolation between the LLM prediction and the $k$-nearest neighbours label distribution in the datastore. Specifically, for each training instance $x_{i}$, Xu et al. (2023a) concatenate it into prompt $P_{i}$ together with $k$ in-context examples, where $k=|Y|$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
P_{i}=\pi\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right) \oplus \ldots \pi\left(x_{|Y|}, y_{|Y|}\right) \oplus \pi\left(x_{i}, *\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

By querying the LLM using $P_{i}$, we obtain a distribution over tokens $p\left(v \mid P_{i}, \theta\right)$. Rather than mapping it back to label space $Y$, the distribution is cached as the key representation for the instance $x_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}}=p\left(v \mid P_{i} ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is mapped to the label $y_{i}$. The entire datastore thus consists of $\left\{\left(\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}}, y_{i}\right)\right\}$ pairs, where $K=\left\{\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}}\right\}_{i}$ denotes the set of keys. At inference time, we construct the same prompt and obtain the distribution $P_{\text {test }}=p\left(v \mid P_{\text {test }} ; \theta_{\text {LLM }}\right)$. We then match the distribution against cached $K$ in the datastore, where standard $K L$-divergence is used to measure the distance:

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P_{\text {test }}|| k_{i}\right)=\sum_{v} p\left(v \mid P_{\text {test }} ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right) \log \frac{p\left(v \mid P_{\text {test }} ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right)}{p\left(v \mid P_{i} ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right)} \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The predictions are then calculated by interpolating the LLM output and its $m$ nearest neighbours distribution, where $\mathrm{NN}_{m}(*, K)$ denotes the set of $m$ nearest neighbours in $K$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{y}_{\text {pred }}=\arg \max _{y \in Y}\left[(1-\alpha) \cdot p\left(y \mid P_{\text {test }} ; \theta_{\mathrm{LLM}}\right)+\alpha \cdot p \sum_{i \in \mathrm{NN}_{m}\left(P_{\text {test }}, K\right)} \mathbb{I}\left(y_{i}^{a}=y\right)\right] \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Following Xu et al. (2023a), in this work, we use $\alpha=0.2$ and $m=k / 2$.

R-ICL Retrieval-augmented ICL (Lin et al., 2022) was proposed to mitigate the sensitivity of ICL methods to the choice and order of the in-context examples: rather than randomly sampling $\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$, R-ICL use a retriever to identify the most similar examples to the test instance $x_{\text {test }}$ from the training set $\mathcal{T}$. In this paper, we follow Li et al. (2023) and consider the following retrievers: BM25 (Robertson \& Zaragoza, 2009), SBERT (Reimers \& Gurevych, 2019) and Instructor (Su et al., 2022); more details are available in Appendix A.1.

### 3.2 Attack Methods

This paper aims to study how perturbations can affect the performance of different ICL methods through adversarial attacks. We classify our 7 attacks into 3 categories: Test Sample Attack, Demonstration Attack, and DataStore Attack.

Test Sample Attacks We focus on the three different types of attack: typo-based perturbations - TextBugger (TB) (Li et al., 2018); embedding-similarity-based perturbations TextFooler (TF) (Jin et al., 2019); and context-aware perturbations - BERT-Attack (BA) (Li et al., 2020).

Demonstration Attacks For demonstration attacks, we refer to adversarial attacks where the training demonstrations are adversarially perturbed. We consider this type of attack to investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to adversarial perturbations to the training demonstrations and their influence on the generalisation properties of the models.

Datastore Attacks One of our objectives is to analyse the sensitivity of retrieval-based ICL methods to adversarial perturbations. Therefore, we consider Irrelevant Context Attacks (Irr.), which work by contaminating the demonstration pools with irrelevant contexts. Our Irrelevant Context Attacks extended Min et al. (2022) - we replace 50\% of the original demonstrations in the training data with Out-of-Distrubtion (OoD) examples. Further details and analyses are available in Appendix A.3.

## 4 Experiments

### 4.1 Settings

Datasets To assess the robustness, we selected six sentiment and multiple-choice text classification datasets: SST2 (Socher et al., 2013), RTE (Dagan et al., 2005), CR (Hu \& Liu, 2004), MR (Pang \& Lee, 2005), MNLI-matched (Williams et al., 2018), and TREC (Voorhees \& Tice, 2000). We provide further details, including prompt templates and dataset statistics, in Appendix A.2. Unless explicitly mentioned, LLaMA-2-7B was mainly used as the base model for our experiments (Touvron et al., 2023). For experiments involving randomness (i.e., Vanilla ICL and $k \mathbf{N N}$-ICL), we conducted trials with three different random seeds to ensure the reliability of our findings.

Evaluation To evaluate and compare the vulnerabilities across different types of attacks, in line with Wang et al. (2023a); Zhu et al. (2023), we assess the model's performance in a benign (attack-free) context (Clean) and calculate the Attack Success Rate (ASR). The ASR is defined as $\frac{\text { Clean Accuracy-Attack Accuracy }}{\text { Clean Accuracy }}$, where Attack Accuracy denotes the model's accuracy under attack.

### 4.2 Results

The 8 -shot attack results are presented in Table 1 with 8 -shot attacks, and detailed results are available in Appendix B.1.

Overview: Retrieval-based models exhibit higher Clean accuracy: $3.27 \%$ higher than vanilla ICL with the best performed SBERT retriever; similar finding with Rubin et al. (2021) that related demonstrations enhance the performance. For adversarial attacks, our proposed adversarial attack methods, Swap-Labels and Swap-Labels (Fix), are effective techniques for manipulating LLM predictions. On the other hand, irrelevant context attacks have a negligible effect on performance. We summarise two major findings about the adversarial robustness across different ICL methods.

Finding 1: Retrieval-based models are more robust against test-sample attacks; however, it could fall short under demonstration attack.

As shown in Table 1, all three R-ICL methods outperform vanilla ICL and $\mathrm{kNN}$-ICL among all Text Sample Attacks (TB, TF and BA), with a drop in ASR by $4.87 \%$ and $2.47 \%$, respectively. ${ }^{2}$ In Figure 2, we observe an increased gap in the ASR between ICL and R-ICL when the number of shots goes up. Therefore, we believe in-context learning benefits from[^1]

Recall that these textual attacks are designed to deceive LLMs by replacing words with their synonyms or introducing typos in the input sentences. This strategy can be viewed as exploiting LLM's parametric knowledge (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goyal et al., 2022). In this case, R-ICL can provide supported demonstrations by retrieving related

examples to enhance the contextual knowledge to the LLM, therefore reducing the noise of the LLM prediction.

On the other side, we see an increase in ASR for Retrieval-based ICL when demonstrations are under attack, demonstrating a $1 \%-6 \%$ increase in ASR compared with vanilla ICL. This demonstrates the deficit of retrieval-based models that can sometimes overly rely on the retrieved demonstrations and are more vulnerable when demonstrations are perturbed.

Finding 2: $\quad k N N-I C L$ is highly sensitive to adversarial perturbations on test samples and demonstration.

In Table 1, $k$ NN-ICL shows the highest ASR in Demonstration Attack, specifically showing the highest vulnerability to AdvICL, $40 \%-50 \%$ higher than ICL and R-ICL. Recall that for $k$ NN-ICL, demonstrations and test samples are mapped into the hidden space to compute the label distribution with nearest neighbours. Any perturbations on the demonstration might notably affect their position in the hidden space and alter the label distribution significantly. Also, in Figure 2, kNN-ICL exhibits a consistently ascending trend in ASR as the number of examples increases, with $15 \%$ higher than the other methods. This further illustrates that incorporating nearest neighbours algorithms inevitably includes more noise, thereby increasing vulnerability.

Overall, our experiment results show that few-shot methods in LLM could still be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, leading to a $50 \%$ drop in performance on average. Pairing with previous works on jailbreaking leads to the need for a continuous effort to improve the robustness of LLMs. We include quantitative results in the Appendix B.2.

### 4.3 Ablation Study

In this section, we extend our experiments to four other models: LLaMA-2-13B, larger version of 7B model; Vicuna-7B (Chiang et al., 2023), instruction-tuned from LLaMA-27B; Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) and Gemma-7B (Gemma Team et al., 2024), aiming to provide a view for models from different families to prevent potential bias posed within the pretraining data for LLaMA models. These results allowing us to analyze the vulnerability of modern models with better coverage. We conducted the experiments on RTE datasets with 8 -shot demonstrations. Even larger models such as LLaMA-2-70B or Mixtral-8√ó7B (Jiang et al., 2024) are ignored due to attacking them is expensive and slow. Instead, we leave them in the following section for attack transferability (\$4.4).

The results are shown in Figure 3 for R-ICL (corresponding results for ICL are presented in Figure 5). It can be observed that most adversarial attacks remain effective across all models, including the Swap-Labels attack we proposed. Thus, it still posed a major threat on modern LLMs. Specifically, Vicuna-7B tends to be more sensitive when attack on text sample (TextBugger) or when demonstrations are under attack (AdvICL); while Gemma7B-most recently released model-shows a higher vulnerability when the context or label in demonstrations is adversarial perturbed, compared to other base models. Notably, the

irrelevant context attacks become less vulnerable to more recent release models, especially Vicuna, which shows nearly no effect after being tuned with instructions, showing improved capability in the latest LLMs for filtering OoD contexts (Shi et al., 2023).

### 4.4 Attack Transferability

In this section, we would like to answer two questions: Are these attacks transferable across different models, and can larger models mitigate the vulnerability to these attacks? To this end, we conducted two sets of experiments: (1) transfer attacks within the same model family from small models to their large variants, by testing on LLaMA-2 and Mistral famililes; (2) whether attacks still be effective across models from different family, by transferring attacks to Vicuna-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B, following the same settings as Section 4.3. Our experiments focused on the RTE dataset, chosen for its pronounced drop in robustness when subjected to these attacks. Due to memory constraints, both Mixtral- $8 \times 7 \mathrm{~B}$ and LLaMA2-70B were run with 8-bit quantization (Frantar et al., 2022), while the remaining models were in full precision. Hong et al. (2024) tested on AdvGLUE++ and showed that quantized LLMs have negligible drops in adversarial robustness to their source model.

The results of the transfer attack with R-ICL are shown in Figure 4 (corresponding results for ICL are presented in Figure 6). Most attacks are transferable and achieve an ASR of $15 \%-40 \%$ on similar scale models; except for AdvICL, which cannot transfer between models. Also, Swap-Labels attacks are shown to be less effective when targeting instruction-tuned models (e.g. Vicuna and Mistral-7B-Instruct), pointing to the instruction-tuning process leading models to be less sensitive to its demonstration (Sun et al., 2023). Specifically, the results shown in Figure 4(L) confirm that larger models tend to be more robust, as indicated by a reduction of $6 \%$ on average in ASR between the 13B and 70B models. However, the MoE variants of Mistral-7B-Instruct exhibit a similar or even higher ASR compared to its dense version, as illustrated in Figure 4(M). This finding deviates from previous work by Puigcerver et al. (2022), which investigates adversarial robustness in MoE, showing Vision MoE models are less vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We believe this discrepancy might be subject to the difference between on how MoE is applied in NLP (token) and Vision (image-patch) models. Remember that in the training of MoE models, experts are specialised to handle different tasks (Xue et al., 2024); perturbations in the input texts might change the router output and be routed to experts that are less capable for the targeted tasks, leading to more vulnerability and changes in the output. We hope our findings encourage future work to study the robustness of MoE models, both from the training and router perspectives, given their widespread use nowadays.

## 5 Defence Methods: DARD

In this section, we propose an easy yet effective method to enhance the robustness of retrieval-based models against adversarial attacks on test samples. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial defence method named Demonstration Augmentation Retrieval Defences (DARD). This approach performs adversarial augmentation on the training data and mixes them into the retrieval bases for R-ICL. The initiative is that adversarial training in LLM can be costly in memory, and Xie et al. (2021); Dai et al. (2022) showed that in-context learning can be seen as an implicit finetuning method.

### 5.1 Methodology

The methods begin by adversarially perturbing the training examples, similar to previous approaches. Our experiments use the RTE dataset, focusing on an 8-shot setting for this section. For each of the 872 test samples in RTE, the retriever selects the 8 -shot most similar examples for demonstrations. After deduplication, we are left with 7,293 distinct examples. These are concatenated with one-shot examples, and adversarial attacks (TF, TB, and BA) are performed on the extracted training samples. Only the successful examples are retained, resulting in 16,206 perturbed examples. In the adversarial training paradigm, such perturbed examples would typically be used to fine-tune models. However, our approach, $D A R D$, reintegrates these examples into the training demonstration for retrieval during the inference stage. It is important to note that we impose a constraint whereby each example and its perturbed examples can be retrieved no more than once in same prompt for ICL. This is because we observed that most retrieved samples were variants of the same examples with perturbations without this constraint, which reduced both performance and robustness.

### 5.2 Results

For baselines, we compared with No Defence, Random Augmentation (Addition, Deletion) inspired by Robey et al. (2023), which are smoothing methods used to defend against attacks. We also compared with adversarially trained models following vanilla ICL setup. We show the results in Table 2 (detailed results are in Table 18). Although the adversarially trained models show a higher clean accuracy as it's directly fine-tuned on RTE data, our methods with SBERT outperform it by $2 \%$ reduction in ASR; both BM25 and SBERT variants of DARD have significant improvement on robustness against No Defence baseline.

## 6 Summary

While ICL sensitivity is a widely known issue, our paper provides an alternative view of the problem through adversarial attacks. In summary, our paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the effects of perturbations on modern few-shot methods for LLMs inference and also proposes new adversarial attacks targeted at ICL models. Besides their perfor-
mance, the findings show the other side regarding retrieval-based models related to their robustness. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of retrieval-based models in data augmentation strategies for adversarial defense.

There are many open questions for future work.One of the most profound findings is that our study on attack transferability demonstrates that larger models generally exhibit better robustness; however, this does not necessarily hold true for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Given the recent surge in their popularity, it is crucial to investigate the conditions under which MoE models may fail and to understand the reasons behind their vulnerabilities.
