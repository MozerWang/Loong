#### Abstract

We introduce $\mathcal{X}$ FT, a simple yet powerful training scheme, by simply merging upcycled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to unleash the performance limit of instruction-tuned code Large Language Models (LLMs). While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning, $\mathcal{X}$ FT introduces a shared expert mechanism with a novel routing weight normalization strategy into sparse upcycling, which significantly boosts instruction tuning. After finetuning the upcycled MoE model, $\mathcal{X}$ FT introduces a learnable model merging mechanism to compile the upcycled MoE back to a dense model, achieving upcycled MoE-level performance with only dense-model compute. By applying $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ to a $1.3 \mathrm{~B}$ model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM ( $\angle 3 \mathrm{~B})$ with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. With the same data and model architecture, $\mathcal{X}$ FT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by $13 \%$ on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from $2 \%$ to $13 \%$ on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability. $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ is fully orthogonal to existing techniques such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-InSTRUCT, opening a new dimension for improving code instruction tuning.

## 1 Introduction

Program synthesis (or code generation) is a longstanding problem explored since the early days of computer science (Manna and Waldinger, 1971). Recently, instruction tuning of code Large Language Models (LLMs) has been used to improve many coding tasks (Chaudhary, 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023), such as text-to-code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021), code completion (Cassano et al., 2022), and data science engineering (Lai et al., 2022).

A typical instruction tuning flow involves two steps (Zhang et al., 2023): (i) curating an instruc-

tion dataset of instruction-output pairs, where the instruction reflects human intents in natural language and the output includes explained code snippets that correspond to the intent; and (ii) supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained LLM on the instruction dataset. In the realm of code, multiple instruction-tuning methods have been proposed to curate high-quality instruction datasets. For example, Code Evol-Instruct (Luo et al., 2023) uses ChatGPT to obtain complex synthetic code instructions with heuristic prompts, while OSSInSTRUCT (Wei et al., 2023) prompts ChatGPT to generate new coding problems by drawing inspiration from open source code snippets. While existing work focuses on the data perspectives of instruction tuning, they all follow the standard SFT, leaving room for exploring advanced training schemes.

We argue that prior works largely overlook the possibility of improving the code instruction tuning by advancing the training schemes. Figure 1 depicts the supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which directly starts with the pre-trained weights and architecture for fine-tuning. The model is dense here because all parameters are activated to compute the next token (assuming it is a decoder-only LLM). In contrast to fine-tuning a dense model, following the scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020) (i.e., more parameters, better performance), sparse upcycling (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023) is proposed to efficiently upgrade the model sizes by upcycling a dense LLM to a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model. An MoE model is efficient because the generation of the next token only involves a subset of parameters (i.e., experts) and thus is sparsely activated. For example, Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), compared to a dense 7B model, uses approximately $8 \times$ parameters and $2 \times$ computation, i.e., only 2 out of 8 experts are dynamically selected to compute the next token. However, there are two key limitations when using sparse upcycling in instruction tuning: (i) Slow scaling: Komatsuzaki et al. (2023) show that sparse upcycling improves the dense SFT marginally at the early phase, requiring orders of magnitude of extra compute to achieve decent improvement; and (ii) Inference cost: though MoE is more efficient than directly scaling the size of dense LLMs, MoE is still expensive, especially at inference, as it introduces significantly more parameters (i.e., memory) and, more importantly, computes during inference, compared to its dense counterparts.

In this paper, we propose $\mathcal{X} \mathbf{F T}$ : by simply merging upcycled MoE models, we push the performance limit of instruction-tuned code LLMs. While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning efficiently (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023), $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ addresses this challenge by isolating one expert as the shared expert among all the other experts in each MoE layer, inspired by DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024) and MoCLE (Gou et al., 2024). $\mathcal{X}$ FT also includes a novel routing weight normalization strategy to eliminate scale mismatch between the upcycled MoE layer with the shared expert and the original dense layer, which will otherwise lead to performance degradation (Wu et al., 2022). After the upcycled MoE model finishes the SFT phase, motivated by Model Soups (Wortsman et al., 2022), $\mathcal{X}$ FT uses a learnable model merging mechanism to output a dense model by merging all the expert networks in the upcycled MoE, i.e., the final dense model is of the same model structure and size as the original pre-trained model, achieving similar performance without paying extra inference cost as the sparse upcycling. With only $1.3 \mathrm{~B}$ parameters, $\mathcal{X}$ FT achieves 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval and 64.6 pass @ 1 on HumanEval+, which is the new state-of-the-art for tiny code LLMs ( $<3 \mathrm{~B})$. Compared with SFT, $\mathcal{X}$ FT achieves 13\% improvement on HumanEval+. Surprisingly, our model merging mechanism can preserve or even further boost the general performance of the upcycled MoE with around $1 / 8 \times$ parameters! We conclude our contribution as follows:

- Dimension: We open a new dimension of improving instruction tuning of code LLMs by advancing its training scheme, using enhanced sparse upcycling and learnable model merging mechanism, which neither changes the final model structure nor requires more training data.
- Technique: We present $\mathcal{X}$ FT, a new training scheme for code instruction tuning. $\mathcal{X F T}$ involves two steps: upcycling and merging. A pretrained dense LLM is first upcycled into an $\mathrm{MoE}$ with the shared expert setting and then fine-tuned on the instruction dataset. To avoid the performance degradation caused by the scale mismatch issue, we propose a novel routing weight normalization strategy. In addition, we introduce the first learnable mechanism for merging the upcycled MoE into a dense model, eliminating additional inference overhead while preserving or even improving the MoE performance.
- Results: With only 1.3B parameters, $\mathcal{X F T}$ achieves 67.1 pass @ 1 on HumanEval and 64.6 pass @ 1 on HumanEval+, which is the new stateof-the-art for tiny code LLMs ( $<3 \mathrm{~B}$ ). Compared with normal supervised fine-tuning (SFT), $\mathcal{X F T}$ achieves $13 \%$ improvement on HumanEval+! $\mathcal{X F T}$ also achieves a consistent improvement from $2 \%$ to $13 \%$ on MBPP, MultiPL-E, and DS1000 over SFT, demonstrating its generalization.


## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Mixture-of-Experts

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can efficiently scale up model sizes with only sub-linear increases in computation (Shazeer et al., 2017). Compared with the standard Transformer, MoE replaces each FeedForward Network (FFN) layer with an MoE layer, which uses $N$ (i.e., multiple) expert networks that are structurally equivalent to the original FFN layer and uses a router that directs each input token to $K$ out of $N$ expert networks. Formally, for the $l$-th MoE layer, output hidden state $\mathbf{h}_{t}^{l}$ of the $t$-th input token is computed as follows (Dai et al., 2024):

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{h}_{t}^{l} & =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(g_{i, t} \mathrm{FFN}_{i}\left(\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l}\right)\right)+\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l} \\
g_{i, t} & = \begin{cases}s_{i, t} & s_{i, t} \in \operatorname{Topk}\left(s_{t}, K\right) \\
0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}  \tag{1}\\
s_{t} & =\left\{s_{i, t} \mid 1 \leq i \leq N\right\} \\
s_{i, t} & =\operatorname{Softmax}_{i}\left(\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l^{T}} \mathbf{e}_{i}^{l}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $N$ refers to the total number of experts, $g_{i, t}$ refers to the gate value for the $i$-th expert, $\mathrm{FFN}_{i}(\cdot)$ refers to the $i$-th expert, $\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l}$ refers to the hidden states of the $t$-th token which is the input of the $l$-th MoE layer, $s_{i, t}$ refers to the affinity score between the $i$-th expert and the $t$-th token, $\operatorname{Topk}(S, K)$ refers to a function computing $K$ largest scores over $S$, and $\mathbf{e}_{i}^{l}$ refers to the centroid of the $i$-th expert in the $l$-th MoE layer. By definition, each token will only be assigned to and computed in the top $K$ experts among all the $N$ experts.

Recently, many works have been proposed to scale model sizes with MoE architecture (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022; Fedus et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024; Xue et al., 2024). While most MoE models are trained from scratch, sparse upcycling (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023) is proposed to initialize MoE models based on the pre-trained dense model, which can efficiently reduce the computational costs of training MoE models, compared with training MoE models from scratch. Specifically, sparse upcycling constructs a new MoE model by initializing each expert of each MoE layer as a copy of the original FFN layer in the dense model, while directly copying the remaining layers from the dense model to the new MoE model.

### 2.2 Instruction Tuning

Instruction tuning is designed to improve the instruction-following ability of LLMs by finetuning them on the instruction datasets in a supervised fashion (Wei et al., 2022). The quality of the instruction dataset is significant for the effectiveness of instruction tuning and researchers have proposed multiple methods to improve data quality. For example, SELF-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023) synthesizes high-quality instruction data by prompting a foundation LLM with specially designed prompts. To improve SElf-Instruct, Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023) improves the complexity and diversity of the instruction dataset by prompting ChatGPT with heuristic prompts. OSSINSTRUCT (Wei et al., 2023) queries ChatGPT to generate instruction-output pairs by getting inspiration from real-world code snippets.

Recently, some parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques have been proposed to use MoE for better instruction tuning. For example, LoRAMoE (Dou et al., 2023) and MoCLE (Gou et al., 2024) propose MoE-like modules that are constructed with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) to improve instruction tuning, while PESC (Wu et al.,
2024) proposes to integrate adapters into MoE that are upcycled from dense models. Different from these works, $\mathcal{X}$ FT focuses on full fine-tuning, which generally performs better than parameterefficient fine-tuning (Chen et al., 2022).

### 2.3 Weight Averaging

Weight averaging is a commonly used technique to improve the performance of deep learning models. For example, Model Soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) averages the weights of multiple models that are initialized from the same pre-trained model but finetuned with different hyperparameter configurations to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. However, only a few works have been proposed to merge expert networks of an MoE layer to a normal FFN layer using weight averaging. For example, OneS (Xue et al., 2022) proposes several simple weight averaging methods to merge expert networks of a BERT-based MoE model. Closely related to our work, Experts Weights Averaging (EWA) (Huang et al., 2023) proposes to convert an MoE model to a dense model with two steps: (i) During MoE training, EWA conducts weighted averaging of all the expert weights after each weight update of MoE, which is based on a manuallycrafted hyperparameter $\beta$; (ii) After training, EWA converts each MoE layer into an FFN layer by uniformly averaging the experts.

Different from all the aforementioned existing works, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ is the first work proposing a learnable mechanism to merge expert networks in the upcycled MoE model. Furthermore, while the training scheme of EWA is deeply coupled to a specific MoE architecture, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ can be easily adapted to different MoE architectures by only adjusting the final merging process. In addition, unlike EWA, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ does not introduce any hyperparameters into the training of the large MoE models, significantly reducing the computational resources for hyperparameter searching. Our empirical results in Section 4 also showcase the clear advantage of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$.

## $3 \mathcal{X}$ FT

We describe the details of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ in this section. There are two steps in our framework: upcycling (Section 3.1) and merging (Section 3.2). During upcycling, we construct an Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model from the pre-trained dense model, namely $\mathbf{M o E}_{\mathbf{D S}}$, which is then fine-tuned on coding instruction data. For merging, we propose a learnable

model merging method to convert the instructiontuned $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ back to a normal dense model by merging each MoE layer into an FFN layer through weight averaging while directly copying other remaining layers. Consequently, we can obtain $\mathcal{X} \mathbf{T T}_{\text {DS }}$ that has the same model architecture and size as the original pre-trained dense model, which eliminates all the additional inference overhead brought by the original sparse upcycling, while preserving or even improving the performance of $\mathrm{MoE}_{\text {DS }}$. Our framework is illustrated in Figure 2.

### 3.1 Upcycling

Inspired by sparse upcycling (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023), we convert the pre-trained dense LLM to a new MoE by initializing each expert of each MoE layer as a copy of the original FFN layer in the dense model, while directly copying the remaining layers from the dense model to the new MoE model. However, the performance gain brought by sparse upcycling is negligible with a very limited extra training budget (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023) which is exactly the situation we are facing during instruction tuning. Intuitively, it is because each expert in the upcycled MoE model is trained on fewer instruction data than the original dense model does because traditional routers used in sparse upcycling will assign different tokens to different experts and thus reduce the amount of data each expert is trained on (Gou et al., 2024). Consequently, inspired by DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024) and MoCLE (Gou et al., 2024), $\mathcal{X F T}$ introduces the shared expert setting into sparse upcycling to tackle this challenge. We further propose a novel routing weight normalization strategy for $\mathcal{X}$ FT to avoid the potential performance degradation caused by the scale mismatch problem (Wu et al., 2022).

### 3.1.1 Shared Expert for Upcycling

During upcycling, we isolate one shared expert among all the other normal experts in each MoE layer, where the shared expert will be deterministically assigned to handle all the tokens while other normal experts are assigned by the router. By doing so, the upcycled MoE model can achieve a clear performance boost in instruction tuning, where the shared expert can learn general knowledge across the whole instruction dataset while other normal experts learn specific knowledge among different instructions assigned by the router. Formally, the output hidden state $\mathbf{h}_{t}^{l}$ of the $l$-th MoE layer when processing the $t$-th token can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{h}_{t}^{l} & =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(g_{i, t} \operatorname{FFN}_{i}\left(\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l}\right)\right)+\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l} \\
g_{i, t} & = \begin{cases}1-s_{t \max } & i=1 \\
\operatorname{Softmax}_{i}\left(s_{i, t}\right) \cdot s_{t \mathrm{max}} & s_{i, t} \in S_{t K} \\
0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases} \\
S_{t K} & =\operatorname{Topk}\left(\left\{s_{i, t} \mid 1 \leq i \leq N\right\}, K-1\right) \\
s_{t \max } & =\max \left(\left\{s_{i, t} \mid 1 \leq i \leq N\right\}\right) \\
s_{i, t} & = \begin{cases}-\infty & i=1 \\
\operatorname{Softmax}_{i}\left(\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l^{T}} \mathbf{e}_{i}^{l}\right) & i \geq 2\end{cases} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{h}_{t}^{l}$ refers to the output hidden state of the $l$-th MoE layer when processing the $t$-th token, $N$ refers to the total number of experts, $g_{i, t}$ refers to the gate value for the $i$-th expert, $\operatorname{FFN}_{i}(\cdot)$ refers to the $i$-th expert, $\mathbf{u}_{t}^{l}$ refers to the output hidden state of the $l$-th attention layer when processing the $t$-th token
and also the input of the $l$-th MoE layer, $s_{i, t}$ refers to the affinity score between the $i$-th expert and the $t$-th token, $s_{t_{\max }}$ refers to the maximum affinity score among all the experts besides the shared expert, $\operatorname{Topk}(S, K)$ refers to a function computing $K$ largest scores over $S, S_{t K}$ refers to a set of $K-1$ largest affinity scores among all the experts besides the shared expert, and $\mathbf{e}_{i}^{l}$ refers to the centroid of the $i$-th expert in the $l$-th $\mathrm{MoE}$ layer.

$\mathrm{FFN}_{1}$ is chosen as the shared expert in each $\mathrm{MoE}$ layer and each token will be assigned to top $K$ experts including one shared expert and $K-1$ other normal experts. Compared with the original sparse upcycling, there are two major differences:

- Weighted Shared Expert. Following MoCLE (Gou et al., 2024), with the token-to-expert affinity score $s_{i, t}$, we get the maximum affinity score $s_{t_{\max }}$ and use its complement $1-s_{t_{\max }}$ as the routing weight of the shared expert.
- Routing Weight Normalization. Although the shared expert setting is also used in recent works (Dai et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2024), we cannot directly follow their routing strategy because they cannot handle a scale mismatch problem that is unique for sparse upcycling. The scale mismatch problem is that differences between the scale of the output of the upcycled MoE layer and the original FFN layer can cause performance degradation (Wu et al., 2022). To handle this problem, we need to make sure the sum of $g_{i, t}$ equals 1 , so that the output of the MoE layer matches that of the FFN layer in scale. To do so, we normalize the affinity scores of top $K-1$ normal experts with Softmax and scale their sum to $s_{t_{\max }}$ to make sure that the sum of the $g_{i, t}$ of top $K$ experts, including one shared expert and $K-1$ normal experts, equals 1 .


### 3.2 Merging

We propose a learnable model merging method to convert the large MoE model, namely $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{DS}}$, back to a dense model $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$. By doing so, we expect $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ to keep the boosted performance gained during upcycling while keeping its model size the same as the original dense model to avoid any additional inference overhead. Inspired by Model Soups (Wortsman et al., 2022), we choose to merge $\mathrm{MoE}_{\text {DS }}$ by learning the mixing coefficients that can be used to average the parameters of all experts in each MoE layer to obtain a normal FFN layer, while directly copying other remaining layers.
Formally speaking, given the weights of $N$ experts at the $l$-th layer $W_{1}^{l}, W_{2}^{l}, \cdots, W_{N}^{l}$, the process of merging each MoE layer to an FFN layer can be stated as below:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{W^{l}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{i}^{l} W_{i}^{l} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\overline{W^{l}}$ denotes the merged parameter of all $N$ experts and $\alpha_{i}^{l}$ denotes the learnable mixing coefficient of expert $W_{i}^{l}$. We consider a neural network $f(x ; \theta)$ with input $x$ and parameters $\theta$. For loss $\mathcal{L}$ and instruction dataset $\left\{\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)\right\}_{i=1}^{m}$, such mixing coefficients $\alpha$ of all the $L$ layers can be learned via:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\arg \min _{\alpha} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x_{j} ; \theta_{o},\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{i}^{l} W_{i}^{l}\right)_{1: L}\right), y_{i}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\theta_{o}$ refers to all the remaining layers of $\mathrm{MoE}_{\text {DS }}$ other than $\mathrm{MoE}$ layers and $\alpha$ is parameterized as the output of a softmax, so that each $\alpha_{i}^{l}$ is positive and $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{i}^{l}=1$.

While the learning process defined in Eq. (4) is the most intuitive way of learning $\alpha$, our experiment in Section 5.2 shows that, due to the shared expert setting, it tends to simply increase the mixing coefficient of the shared expert at each layer as much as possible to decrease the loss. It is not helpful because, although the shared expert has learned general knowledge across the whole instruction dataset and needs a relatively large mixing coefficient, we still need to keep the scale of the mixing coefficient of other normal experts at a certain level also to keep some specific knowledge learned by other normal experts in the merged parameter $\overline{W^{l}}$.

To solve this issue, we introduce a shared expert rate $\lambda$ to fix the mixing coefficient of the shared expert and learn the mixing coefficients of the remaining normal experts which sums to $1-\lambda$ in each layer. By doing so, we can easily control the scale of the mixing coefficient of the shared expert, while still being able to learn the optimal layer-wise mixing coefficients of other normal experts. Let's say $W_{1}^{l}$ is the shared expert of the $l$-th layer, then Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) can be reformulated as below:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\overline{W^{l}}=\lambda W_{1}^{l}+\sum_{i=2}^{N} \alpha_{i}^{l} W_{i}^{l}  \tag{5}\\
\arg \min _{\alpha} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x_{j} ; \theta_{o}, \bar{W}_{1: L}^{l}\right), y_{i}\right) \tag{6}
\end{gather*}
$$

In practice, we uniformly initialize the mixing coefficients $\alpha$ of all the normal experts as $\frac{1-\lambda}{N-1}$, which is then trained on the same instruction dataset as upcycling.

## 4 Main Evaluation

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Training. We use DeepSeek-Coder-Base 1.3B (Guo et al., 2024) as the main base code LLM. evol-codealpaca-v1, an open-source Evol-Instruct (Luo et al., 2023) dataset containing $110 \mathrm{~K}$ samples, is used as our instruction dataset. MoE $\mathbf{D S}_{\text {, }}$, our MoE model upcycled from the base model, is implemented following LlamaMoE (LLaMA-MoE Team, 2023). It is constructed with 8 experts in one expert layer and the top 6 experts ${ }^{1}$ are activated for each token, including one shared expert. As such, we denote the model size of $\mathbf{M o E}_{\text {DS }}$ as $8 \times 1.3 \mathrm{~B}$. Other hyperparameter settings are detailed in Appendix A.1. We finally obtain $\mathcal{X} \mathbf{F T}_{\text {DS }}$ by using the learned mixing coefficients to merge MoE layers inside $\mathrm{MoE}_{\text {DS }}$ as normal FFN layers. Note that $\mathcal{X} \mathbf{F T}_{\text {DS }}$ is the final instructiontuned LLM we produce, while $\mathbf{M o E}_{\text {DS }}$ is only an intermediate product of $\mathcal{X}$ FT framework.

Baselines. To study the effectiveness of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$, we build a baseline model, namely $\mathbf{S F T}_{\text {DS }}$, by directly performing SFT for DeepSeek-Coder-Base 1.3B on evol-codealpaca-v1. To compare $\mathcal{X}$ FT with EWA (Huang et al., 2023), we also implement a baseline $\mathbf{E W A}_{\text {DS }}$ and instruction-tune it using the same hyperparameter setting as $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$, which is described in Appendix A.1. More implementation details of $\mathrm{EWA}_{\text {DS }}$ can be seen in Appendix A.2. Furthermore, we incorporate multiple small open-source models ( $\angle 3 \mathrm{~B}$ ) as our baselines, including DeepSeek-Coder-Base 1.3B, DeepSeek-CoderInstruct 1.3B (Guo et al., 2024), Phi-2 2.7B, and STABLE-CODE 3B (Pinnaparaju et al., 2024).

### 4.2 Python Text-to-Code Generation

HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) benchmarks are the two most widelyused collections of Python code generation tasks. We further employ HumanEval+ and MBPP+, which use more tests automatically generated by EvalPlus (Liu et al., 2023) for more rigorous evaluation. We leave the details in Appendix A.3.[^0]

Table 1 shows the pass@ 1 results of different LLMs. XFT achieves 67.1 pass@ 1 on HumanEval and 64.6 pass @1 on HumanEval+, which makes it the new state-of-the-art small code LLM ( $<3 \mathrm{~B}$ ). We can also observe that $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ has a clear improvement over the $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ on both benchmarks, with $13 \%$ and $2 \%$ improvement on HumanEval+ and MBPP+ respectively, while $\mathrm{EWA}_{\text {DS }}$ even performs worse than $\operatorname{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ on $\mathrm{MBPP}(+)$. $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ also outperforms EWA $\mathrm{ES}_{\text {S }}$ on both benchmarks. Surprisingly, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ even surpasses $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ on HumanEval and HumanEval+, despite only using around $1 / 8 \times$ parameters and around $1 / 6 \times$ computations, which showcases the effectiveness of our simple learnable merging technique. Appendix A. 4 further demonstrates the statistical significance of the improvements brought by $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$.

### 4.3 Multilingual Code Generation

We use MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2022), a multiprogramming benchmark that supports 18 programming languages in addition to Python, to evaluate the multilingual ability and generalizability of $\mathcal{X}$ FT. Among these, we choose 6 representative programming for their distinct language features: Java, JavaScript, C++, PHP, Swift, and Rust, following Wei et al. (2023). Table 2 shows, among all 1.3B models, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ achieves the best average multilingual performance and performs the best on 5 (out of 6) individual programming languages, overall largely improving $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ which uses standard SFT. Notably, the overall performance of $\mathrm{EWA}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is on par with $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$, indicating that EWA $_{\text {DS }}$ may not improve SFT on multilingual coding. Appendix A. 5 further studies whether each expert in $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ specializes differently in these programming languages.

### 4.4 Code Generation for Data Science

The DS-1000 dataset (Lai et al., 2022) is a collection of 1000 realistic data science coding problems ranging from 7 popular data science libraries in Python, including Matplotlib (plt), NumPy (np), Pandas (pd), SciPy (scp), Scikit-Learn (sk), PyTorch (py), and TensorFlow (tf). We evaluate $\mathcal{X}$ FT on DS-1000 to understand its effectiveness for practical data science engineering. We follow the evaluation setting of prior works (Guo et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023). In Table 3, $\mathcal{X}$ FT $_{\text {DS }}$ achieves the best overall performance among all the evaluated 1.3B models. Specifically, $\mathcal{X}$ FT $_{\text {DS }}$ consistently surpasses $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ among all the seven studied libraries

## 5 Ablation Study

### 5.1 Effect of Shared Expert with Routing Weight Normalization

We demonstrate the importance of the shared expert of $\mathcal{X}$ FT by comparing its performance with the sparse upcycling (Komatsuzaki et al., 2023) baseline that does not employ any shared expert. As shown in Table 4, the performance of the original sparse upcycling (with the "- Shared Expert" label) drops greatly compared with $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{Ds}}$. Notably, the sparse upcycling model even performs worse than $\mathrm{SFT}_{\text {DS }}$ on HumanEval+, showing its ineffectiveness for instruction tuning.

While the shared expert setting is also employed in most recent works (Dai et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2024), their routing strategy will cause performance degradation due to the scale mismatch between the outputs of the upcycled MoE layer and the original FFN layer. To understand the importance of routing weight normalization, we conduct an ablation by excluding it from $\mathcal{X}$ FT. Table 4 shows that, after removing routing weight normalization, the performance substantially decreases, despite being still better than the original sparse upcycling that does not use the shared expert setting.

### 5.2 Effect of Merging Strategy

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our learnable merging technique by comparing it with (1) directly merging experts with initialized mixing coefficients, and (2) the learnable merging technique without the shared rate setting, which is the same setting as the learned soup in Model Soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) and is described in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4). Specifically, we initialize the learnable mixing coefficient of the shared expert as 0.75 and that of the other 7 normal experts as $\frac{1}{28}$ for fair comparison. As shown in Table 5, trained mixing coefficients outperform the initialized mixing coefficients for merging. Furthermore, removing the shared rate setting will largely degrade the performance of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ on both HumanEval and

HumanEval+, demonstrating its importance.

We further study the effect of the shared expert rate $\lambda$ on the performance of the final merged dense model. We evenly choose five shared expert rates, including $0.00,0.25,0.50,0.75$, and 1.00 , to perform the learnable merging process and evaluate each merged dense model accordingly. Note that 0.75 is the default shared expert rate used in our main experiments. If the shared expert rate is 0.00 , it means that the shared expert is ignored when constructing the merged dense model from the upcycled MoE model; if the shared expert rate is 1.00 , it means that the final dense model is built by simply extracting the shared expert from the upcycled

| Model | $\lambda$ | HumanEval | HumenEval+ |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | ---: |
| $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ | - | 61.6 | 57.3 |

MoE model. As shown in Table 6, there are mainly three interesting observations:

- The performance of the final merged dense model improves gradually when the shared expert rate grows from 0.00 to 0.75 , indicating that general knowledge learned by the shared expert is important for better performance.
- The performance of the final merged dense model drops significantly when the shared expert rate grows from 0.75 to 1.00 , showing that specific knowledge learned by other experts is also irreplaceable and ignoring them will lead to a significant performance drop.
- All the final merged dense models consistently outperform the normal SFT baseline regardless of their shared expert rate, further demonstrating the effectiveness of $\mathcal{X}$ FT.


### 5.3 Effect of Base Code LLM

In this section, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ is not dependent on the choice of base code LLMs. To show this, we conduct an ablation experiment by applying $\mathcal{X}$ FT to STABLE-CODE 3B (Pinnaparaju et al., 2024), whose architecture is different from DeepSeek-Coder-Base 1.3B (Guo et al., 2024), and see whether it can still improve

| Model | HumanEval | HumanEval+ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\overline{\mathrm{SFT}}_{\text {STABLE }}$ | 62.2 | 56.1 |
| $\overline{\operatorname{MoE}_{S 1}}$ | 64.0 | 59.1 |
| $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{STABLE}}$ | 68.3 | 62.2 |

Table 7: Ablation over the effect of the base model by replacing DeepSeek-Coder-Base 1.3B with STABLECODE $3 \mathrm{~B}$. $\mathcal{X}$ FT can consistently improve the instruction tuning performance of different base code LLMs.

its performance. Hyperparameter settings are detailed in Appendix A.6. As is shown in Table $7, \mathcal{X}$ FT $_{\text {STABLE }}$ significantly improves $\mathrm{SFT}_{\text {STABLE }}$ by $10 \%$ on HumanEval and $11 \%$ on HumanEval+ respectively. Furthermore, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\text {STABLE }}$ consistently boosts the performance of $\mathrm{MoE}_{\text {STABLE }}$ while only using $1 / 4 \times$ parameters and $1 / 2 \times$ computations. These results show that the effectiveness of $\mathcal{X}$ FT does not depend on any specific choice of base code LLMs, demonstrating the generalizability of $\mathcal{X}$ FT across different model architectures.

## 6 Discussion

### 6.1 Training Overhead Analysis

Compared with $\mathrm{SFT}, \mathcal{X}$ FT will inevitably introduce additional overhead in the training process because $\mathcal{X}$ FT needs to fine-tune the upcycled MoE model while the normal SFT technique only needs to finetune the original dense model. To better understand the effect of such overhead, we conduct an experiment where we use the same training budget (i.e., the same GPU hours) instead of the same training steps for the normal SFT baseline. As shown in Table 8 , although sharing the same training budget as $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$, the performance of $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is still significantly worse than that of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$, demonstrating the ability of $\mathcal{X}$ FT to unlock the power of code instruction tuning using the same training budget.

### 6.2 Generalizability for General Tasks

In this section, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{X}$ FT can improve the performance of LLMs on general tasks across different domains by applying $\mathcal{X}$ FT to general instruction tuning. We use TinyLlama 1.1B (Zhang et al., 2024) as the base model and use evol-instruct-70k (Xu et al., 2023) as the training dataset for general instruction tuning. Following existing work (Zhang et al., 2024), we use MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) with the 5-shot setting as our evaluation benchmark to showcase the general performance of LLMs. Hyperparameter settings are detailed in Appendix A.7. As shown

| Model | HumanEval | HumanEval+ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ <br> w/ same steps | 61.6 | 57.3 |
| $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ <br> w/ same budget | 62.2 | 57.3 |
| $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ | 67.1 | 64.6 |

Table 8: Experiments on the effect of training overhead. For our two SFT baselines, "w/ same steps" refers to one SFT baseline using the same training steps as $\mathcal{X}$ FT while "w/ same budget" refers to the other SFT baseline using the same training budget as $\mathcal{X}$ FT. $\mathcal{X F T}$ can consistently outperform both SFT baselines to a large extent, further demonstrating the ability of $\mathcal{X}$ FT to unlock the power of code instruction tuning.

in Table 9 , overall, $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{TL}}$ improves $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{TL}}$ by $5 \%$ on MMLU, demonstrating the generalizable effectiveness of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ for general instruction tuning.

### 6.3 Preliminary Theoretical Explanation

We provide a preliminary theoretical explanation of $\mathcal{X}$ FT by considering a simplified variant of it. Let's start by analyzing the two major steps of $\mathcal{X}$ FT:

- Step 1: Upcycling. According to the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), the upcycled MoE model performs better than the normal SFT dense model due to more trainable parameters.
- Step 2: Merging. We consider a simplified variant of $\mathcal{X}$ FT, where the upcycled MoE model (e.g., MoE $\mathrm{DS}_{\text {) can be viewed as the ensembling }}$ of two dense models and the merged dense model (e.g., $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ ) can be viewed as the merging of the same two dense models; see Appendix A. 8 for more details. As such, we can directly apply the theoretical analyzing process in Section 4 of (Wortsman et al., 2022) to analyze the performance difference between the upcycled $\mathrm{MoE}$ model and the merged dense model, which is initially designed to analyze the performance difference between model ensembling and model merging. According to (Wortsman et al., 2022), the convexity of the loss can help the merged dense model achieve a similar expected loss as that of the upcycled MoE model.

Overall, the Upcycling step improves the performance with more trainable parameters, while the Merging step maintains the upcycled MoElevel performance with only dense-model compute. Consequently, we provide a preliminary theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$.

| Model | Discipline |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | Humanities | Social Science | STEM | Other |  |
| $\mathrm{SFT}_{\mathrm{TL}}$ | $\mathbf{2 5 . 3 8}$ | 23.30 | 24.20 | 26.78 | 24.97 |
| $\mathrm{MoE}_{\mathrm{TL}}$ | 23.85 | 26.32 | 27.40 | 28.03 | 26.11 |
| $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}_{\mathrm{TL}}$ | 23.91 | $\mathbf{2 6 . 4 9}$ | $\mathbf{2 7 . 7 2}$ | $\mathbf{2 8 . 2 9}$ | $\mathbf{2 6 . 3 0}$ |

Table 9: Experiments on the generalizable effectiveness of $\mathcal{X}$ FT for general tasks in MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). It shows that $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ can improve the general instruction tuning performance of LLMs.

## 7 Conclusion

This paper introduces $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ to unlock the power of code instruction tuning by simply merging upcycled MoE. Similar to SFT, $\mathcal{X}$ FT starts with a dense LLM and produces a fine-tuned dense LLM with the exact size and model structure. Yet, $\mathcal{X}$ FT improves SFT by upcycling the pre-trained dense LLM to an MoE model for fine-tuning, after which we compile the MoE model back to an efficient dense LLM with a learnable merging mechanism. As such, we unleash the performance limit of instruction tuning without any additional inference overhead. Using the same dataset, $\mathcal{X}$ FT improves SFT on a variety of benchmarks, including HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, from $2 \%$ to $13 \%$. By applying $\mathcal{X}$ FT to DeepSeekCoder-Base 1.3B, we create the next state-of-theart small $(<3 \mathrm{~B})$ LLM for code. The ultimate dense LLM produced by $\mathcal{X} F$ T preserves or even outperforms the full upcycled $\mathrm{MoE}$ which uses $8 \times$ parameters as much as our final dense LLM. $\mathcal{X F T}$ is fully orthogonal to the existing instruction tuners such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-InSTRUCT, opening a new dimension to maximal code instruction tuning.

## Limitations

While $\mathcal{X}$ FT has proven to be effective through extensive experiments in the paper, we apply our technique to LLMs with no more than 3B parameters due to resource constraints. This limitation hinders our ability to showcase the impact of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$ on larger models. In addition, to balance the general knowledge in the shared expert and the specific knowledge in other normal experts, we introduce a hyperparameter $\lambda$ in the merging process of $\mathcal{X} \mathrm{FT}$, which might slightly increase the efforts for hyperparameter search. It would be interesting to explore other hyperparameter-free techniques to tackle this challenge in the future. Furthermore, while $\mathcal{X}$ FT has been empirically proven powerful, it would be interesting to provide a theoretical explanation for its strong performance.
