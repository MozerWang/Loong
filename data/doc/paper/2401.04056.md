#### Abstract

We present Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO), an algorithm for reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our approach is minimalist in that it does not require training a reward model nor unstable adversarial training and is therefore rather simple to implement. Our approach is maximalist in that it provably handles non-Markovian, intransitive, and stochastic preferences while being robust to the compounding errors that plague offline approaches to sequential prediction. To achieve the preceding qualities, we build upon the concept of a Minimax Winner (MW), a notion of preference aggregation from the social choice theory literature that frames learning from preferences as a zero-sum game between two policies. By leveraging the symmetry of this game, we prove that rather than using the traditional technique of dueling two policies to compute the MW, we can simply have a single agent play against itself while maintaining strong convergence guarantees. Practically, this corresponds to sampling multiple trajectories from a policy, asking a rater or preference model to compare them, and then using the proportion of wins as the reward for a particular trajectory. We demonstrate that on a suite of continuous control tasks, we are able to learn significantly more efficiently than reward-model based approaches while maintaining robustness to the intransitive and stochastic preferences that frequently occur in practice when aggregating human judgments.


## 1. Introduction

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, Christiano et al. (2017)) also known as preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL, Akrour et al. (2012); Wirth[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_54edf70d112037df06bdg-01.jpg?height=510&width=782&top_left_y=666&top_left_x=1080)

Figure 1: The standard pipeline (left) for preference-based RL / RLHF involves training a reward model based on a dataset of pairwise preferences and then optimizing it via RL. We introduce SPO (right), an iterative method that instead optimizes directly based on preference feedback provided by a rater or preference model, with each trajectory getting a reward based on the proportion of other on-policy trajectories it is preferred to. We prove and validate empirically that this approach is more robust to intransitive, non-Markovian, and noisy preferences than prior works.

et al. (2017); Sadigh et al. (2017); Ibarz et al. (2018); Lee et al. (2021b;a); Sikchi et al. (2022)), is a technique for policy optimization based on relative, rather than absolute, feedback. Owing to the relative ease of providing comparative feedback rather than absolute scores for agent behavior for human raters (Miller, 1956), RLHF has been successfully applied across fields from robotics (Cakmak et al., 2011; Tucker et al., 2020; Swamy et al., 2020; Biyik et al., 2020) to recommendation (De Gemmis et al., 2009; Ailon \& Mohri, 2010; Viappiani \& Boutilier, 2010; Afsar et al., 2022), to retrieval (Yue \& Joachims, 2009). As of late, RLHF has attracted renewed interest as a leading technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) (Ziegler et al., 2020; Stiennon et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022).

The predominantly studied approach to RLHF is via Rewardbased RLHF, a two-stage procedure. First, given pairs of preferred and dis-preferred behavior, one trains a reward

(d) Intransitive Preferences

Figure 2: SPO gives us a unified approach to optimize a variety of preference structures. Starting with the idealized case where preferences are consistent with a single underlying reward signal (a), SPO is more sample-efficient than iterative Reward Modeling (RM) based approaches. Moreover, SPO learns more reliably than RM-based approaches with stochastic preferences, where we flip preferences corresponding to a ground truth reward with increasing probability (b). Furthermore, SPO handles complex non-Markovian preferences (c) such as learning to maximize rewards over the first three-quarters of a trajectory while not crossing a threshold on returns in the last quarter, despite searching over a class of Markovian policies. Lastly, considering intransitive preferences generated by aggregating different sub-populations where a single underlying reward function cannot explain the observed preferences, SPO computes a near-exact Minimax Winner (MW) (d).

model to assign higher scores to the former via a classification objective. One then optimizes this reward function via some reinforcement learning algorithm.

Simple as the above recipe is, the key ingredient of a reward model can have some undesirable effects. First, assuming an underlying reward function exists is equivalent to assuming that there exists a total order over agent behavior. This means that there are no intransitivities in rater preferences (i.e. $A \succ B, B \succ C \Rightarrow A \succ C$ ), which contradicts what psychology tells us about actual human decision making (Tversky, 1969; Gardner, 1970). Even if one believes an individual person's preferences are transitive, when aggregated across a population of raters as is necessary at scale, transitivity is unlikely to be satisfied (May, 1954). Second, given the inherent stochasticity of human preferences (Agranov \& Ortoleva, 2017), one often learns a reward model that leads to a collapse in generation diversity. For example, consider a problem where the agent can pick one of two options, each of which is preferred by a sub-population of raters that makes up half of the total population. Due to either finite sample or optimization error, we can easily learn a model that assigns a slightly higher reward to one option over the other. Then, if we were to optimize our policy under this model, we would learn to (almost) exclusively select one option, leaving half of the population unsatisfied.

In recognition of the above concerns, various reward-modelfree approaches have been proposed in the prior literature. One particularly promising set of techniques frames RLHF as a two-player zero-sum game between two policies, each of which attempts to produce behavior that is preferred by a rater to the other's (Yue et al., 2012). While elegant theoretically, this "dueling" framing inherits the inherent instability of adversarial training in practice and has therefore mostly been applied to bandit problems (Dudík et al., 2015; Saha

## et al., 2021; Saha \& Krishnamurthy, 2022).

Motivated by these issues, we provide a simple, theoretically rigorous, and empirically performant approach to RLHF that eliminates reward modeling and does not require adversarial training. Our approach follows from two key insights. First, by framing RLHF as a two-player zero-sum game, we are able to truly eliminate reward models and therefore more capably handle the noisy, intransitive, and non-Markovian preferences that frequently occur in practice. Second, $\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{y}$ leveraging the symmetry of the game, we prove that we can simply train a single agent in a self-play fashion, eliminating the need for unstable adversarial training. Practically, this corresponds to sampling multiple trajectories from the agent, asking a rater or preference model to compare each pair, and setting the reward to be the trajectory's win rate. We call this approach SPO: Self-Play Preference Optimization.

More explicitly, our contributions are as follows:

## 1. We derive SPO: an algorithm for RLHF that avoids

 reward modeling, compounding errors, and adversarial training. By building upon the concept of a Minimax Winner from social choice theory, we are able to frame RLHF as a two-player zero-sum game. We then leverage the symmetry of the payoff matrix of this game to prove that we can simply train a single agent against itself.2. We use a reduction-based analysis to investigate the convergence properties of SPO. When intransitive preferences exist, we prove that SPO converges to an approximate Minimax Winner at the rate of the underlying no-regret algorithm, unlike the usual asymptotic statements one gets for fictitious self-play approaches (Leslie \& Collins, 2006). We also prove that in the case where an underlying reward function does exist, our approach converges to the optimal

#### Abstract

3. We demonstrate that on a suite of continuous control tasks with realistic preference functions, SPO is more performant than reward-model based approaches. We find that our approach is able to learn more sampleefficiently than reward-model based approaches across a variety of preference setups. This includes trajectory-level comparisons based on ground-truth Markovian rewards in the easiest case, stochastic preferences, trajectory-level nonMarkovian preferences and intransitive preferences induced by aggregating over sub-populations. The strong performance of SPO in the latter three challenging setups, all motivated by practical situations, is illustrated in Figure 2.


## 2. Related Work

Dueling Bandits and Dueling RL. Beginning with the seminal work of Yue et al. (2012), various authors have viewed preference-based optimization of a multi-armed or contextual bandit as a two-player zero-sum game (Dudík et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2021; Saha \& Krishnamurthy, 2022; Bengs et al., 2021). Dudík et al. (2015) carry out a detailed theoretical study of the two-player approach in contextual bandits, where they use the name von Neumann winner to refer to the concept of a Minimax Winner. We adopt the latter name due to its older roots in the social choice theory literature. More recently, various authors have investigated dueling reinforcement learning algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In contrast to Pacchiano et al. (2023), we do not need to assume preferences are explained by an underlying reward function. We build upon the work of Wang et al. (2023) by utilizing their reduction of RLHF to adversarial MDP solving. However, we further leverage the structure of the problem to derive single-player algorithms, while all aforementioned approaches requires adversarial training.

Both in the bandit and sequential settings, prior work has considered single-player algorithms for RLHF. However, these results require strong linearity assumptions and are only applicable in the bandit domain (Sui et al., 2017) or assume an underlying Markovian reward function (Novoseller et al., 2020). In contrast, we provide a reduction to no-regret online learning that allows one to plug in any no-regret algorithm (e.g. Online Gradient Descent, Zinkevich (2003)) without additional assumptions. In particular, by leveraging a recent result from Wang et al. (2023), we are able to prove that we can utilize a variation of the Natural Policy Gradient (Kakade, 2001; Agarwal et al., 2021), which practical policy gradient algorithms like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) and TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) approximate, to efficiently compute Minimax Winners, bypassing the hardness result of Daskalakis et al. (2020) by utilizing the structure of our particular game.

Perhaps the most similar work to ours is the concurrent study of Munos et al. (2023). They derive a specific algorithm, focus on quantal response equilibria to be able to prove last-iterate convergence, and treat the problem as a normal-form game. Instead, we focus on a general algorithmic framework, provide convergence guarantees to the Nash equilibrium, and account for the sequential nature of the game. Empirically, they focus on a particular task of learning document summarization from human feedback, while we study continuous control tasks where we experiment with a range of realistic preference functions. Recent work by Chen et al. (2024) formulates inverse RL for LLM fine-tuning as a kind of self-play - we focus on optimizing from preferences rather than from demonstrations.

Our reward model baseline and our continuous control setup are heavily influenced by the works of Christiano et al. (2017); Lee et al. (2021a). One critical distinction from this prior work is rather than assuming that the rater is able to provide snippet-level feedback, we only assume they can perform trajectory-level comparisons, a much less dense form of supervision.

RLHF without Reward Models. Recently, several authors have proposed eliminating reward models from RLHF by leveraging the well-known bijection between the optimal policies of minimum-relative-entropy RL problems and their advantage functions (Ziebart, 2010) to directly optimize the policy by substituting it into the classification loss usually used to train the reward model (Zhao et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023; Hejna et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2023). While these approaches are appealing for their conceptual simplicity and ease of implementation, they suffer from the same issues with intransitive and noisy preferences as they are derived on the basis of an implicit reward model. Additionally, as we discuss further in Appendix B, they can suffer from compounding errors (Ross et al., 2011) due to their offline nature. In a sense, this family of approaches can be thought
of as the preference-based analog to behavioral cloning techniques (Pomerleau, 1988) in imitation learning. In contrast, the technique we propose is the preference-based analog of inverse reinforcement learning approaches (Ziebart, 2010). We summarize this taxonomy in Table 1.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Game Solving

We begin by introducing the notation we will use throughout the paper before defining our solution concept and deriving an efficient algorithm to compute it.

### 3.1. Preliminaries

Consider a finite-horizon reward-free Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Puterman, 2014) parameterized by $\langle\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, H\rangle$ where $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}$ are the state and action spaces, $\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{S})$ is the transition operator, and $H$ is the horizon. ${ }^{1}$ We use $\Xi \triangleq(\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A})^{H}$ to denote the space of trajectories and $\Phi_{h} \triangleq \times(\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A})^{h-1} \times \mathcal{S}$ to denote the space of histories of length $h$.

Online Preference Oracle. In the preference-based RL setup, we are given query access to a preference function

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}: \Xi \times \Xi \rightarrow[-1,1] \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

which, given two trajectories $\xi_{1}, \xi_{2} \in \Xi \times \Xi$, outputs a scalar that indicates which is preferred relative to the other. Practically, this could be either be a preference model trained on an offline dataset (RLAIF, Bai et al. (2022b); Munos et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2023)) or a human-in-the-loop (RLHF, Tucker et al. (2020)). The former setup is similar to rewardbased RLHF, except that the reward model learning step is replaced by learning a pairwise preference model, which is more natural when learning from pairwise preference data. Viewed this way, the preference-model based RLHF based methodology strictly generalizes reward-based RLHF, as we can still represent a preference function that is induced by a difference of rewards, but not every preference function is expressible this way, as we illustrate in the following sections. We also note that in the alignment of generative models, sometimes the preference function simply consists of a prompted generative model that is asked to compare two outputs, rather than a model trained explicitly on a preference dataset (Bai et al., 2022b). In this setting, we are able to optimize directly based on the outputs of such a model, rather than having to take a detour through a reward model.

By construction, preference functions are anti-symmetric, i.e. $\forall \xi_{1}, \xi_{2} \in \Xi \times \Xi, \mathcal{P}\left(\xi_{1}, \xi_{2}\right)=-\mathcal{P}\left(\xi_{2}, \xi_{1}\right)$. Similarly, we have that $\forall \xi \in \Xi, \mathcal{P}(\xi, \xi)=0$.[^1]

We assume access to a convex and compact policy class $\Pi \subseteq\{\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \Delta(\mathcal{A})\}$. With a slight abuse of notation, we can now define the preference function over policy pairs as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}\left(\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}\right) \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{\xi_{1} \sim \pi_{1}, \xi_{2} \sim \pi_{2}}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\xi_{1}, \xi_{2}\right)\right] \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.2. A Brief Introduction to Social Choice Theory

Given choices from a population of raters that are represented as a preference function $\mathcal{P}$, social choice theory (Sen, 1986) studies the question of how best to select options that satisfy the diversity of preferences inherent in said population. For example, consider the set of preferences $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ over options $(a, b, c, d)$ in Figure 3.

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc} 
& a & b & c & d \\
a & 0 & +1 & +1 & -1 \\
b & -1 & 0 & +1 & -1 \\
c & -1 & -1 & 0 & +1 \\
d & +1 & +1 & -1 & 0
\end{array}
$$

Figure 3: A simple preference function $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ over $(a, b, c, d)$. $\mathcal{P}_{1}(x, y)=1$ if $x \succ y,-1$ if $y \succ x$, and 0 if $x \sim y$.

Given this preference function, perhaps the most natural idea would be to pick the option that beats the largest number of other options. In the above matrix, this would be either option $a$ or $d$ as they have the largest row sums. More formally, this technique is known as a Copeland Winner and can be expressed mathematically as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{CW}(\mathcal{P}) \triangleq \underset{\pi \in \Pi}{\operatorname{argmax}} \sum_{\pi^{\prime} \in \Pi} \mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

While intuitively appealing, Copeland Winners are often not unique as in our above example, raising the question of how to break ties. For example, if half of the group feels like $a \succ d$ and the other half like $d \succ a$, picking either option would leave half of the group unsatisfied. This problem only gets worse as the number of options to choose between increases, as there is unlikely to be a single option that everyone prefers to every other option (Dudík et al., 2015). ${ }^{2}$

In essence, approaches that train reward models like rewardbased RLHF (or implicitly assume them like DPO) are akin to computing Copeland Winners. Observe that our above matrix has an intransitivity: $a \succ c, c \succ d, d \succ a$. This means that no reward function can explain the above preferences as it would need to satisfy $r(a)>r(c), r(c)>r(d)$ and $r(d)>r(a)$ simultaneously, an impossibility. Thus, the[^2]model is forced to tie-break between $a$ and $d$, potentially leaving half of the population rather unsatisfied. In practice, this tie-breaking is performed based on the incredibly noisy data used to train the reward model (Taori et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), making it entirely arbitrary. When combined with the fact that an $\epsilon$ difference in reward model outputs can lead to an entirely different optimal policy, we are left with an unsatisfying solution.

One potential solution to the issues with the Copeland Winner is to randomize. For example, we could attempt to pick a distribution over options such that we prefer samples from this distribution to those from any other distribution with probability at least $\frac{1}{2}$. For $\mathcal{P}_{1}$, this would correspond to us picking $(a, c, d)$, each with probability $\frac{1}{3}$, as

$$
\min _{z \in\{a, b, c, d\}} \frac{1}{3}\left(\mathcal{P}_{1}(a, z)+\mathcal{P}_{1}(c, z)+\mathcal{P}_{1}(d, z)\right)=0
$$

Intuitively, this means that while we don't always make everyone happy (an impossibility, Arrow (1950); Satterthwaite (1975)), we never pick a solution that makes a significant portion of the population consistently unhappy. At this point, readers familiar with game theory might recognize that the above corresponds to computing the Nash equilibrium of the two-player zero-sum ( $2 \mathrm{p} 0 \mathrm{~s}$ ) game with payoffs given by the preference function. More formally, we can define the Minimax Winner (MW, Kreweras (1965); Simpson (1969); Kramer (1973); Fishburn (1984)), also known as a von Neumann Winner (Dudík et al., 2015), as the following pair of strategies:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MW}(\mathcal{P}) \triangleq & \underset{p \in \Delta(\Pi)}{\operatorname{argmax}} \min _{q \in \Delta(\Pi)} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{1} \sim p, \pi_{2} \sim q}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}\right)\right], \\
& \left.\underset{q \in \Delta(\Pi)}{\operatorname{argmin}} \max _{p \in \Delta(\Pi)} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{1} \sim p, \pi_{2} \sim q}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}\right)\right]\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Via Sion's minimax theorem (Sion, 1958), we can guarantee that the above solution concept always exists, unlike a unique Copeland Winner. We note that because we assumed $\Pi$ is convex, we are always able to collapse down any distribution $p \in \Delta(\Pi)$ to a single policy $\widetilde{p} \in \Pi$ while preserving solution quality by performing a weighted average:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\widetilde{p}(\xi)=\sum_{\pi \in \Pi} p(\pi) p(\xi \mid \pi) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

In short, this means that we never need to explicitly maintain a distribution over policies, either in theory or practice.

We conclude with a few observations about MWs. First, nowhere in defining a MW did we need to assume the existence of an underlying reward function, rendering the above solution concept truly reward model-free. Second, in the case where there actually does exist an underlying reward function that explains the observed preferences, the MW coincides with the optimal policy for that reward (Dudík et al., 2015), rendering the MW a strict generalization of the CW. Third, MWs satisfy a variety of desirable consistency properties (e.g. merging populations that agree on a MW cannot change the outcome, which is especially important when attempting to re-use preference datasets), which deterministic options like the CW cannot satisfy simultaneously (Brandl et al., 2016).

We now turn our attention to efficiently computing MWs.

### 3.3. One Player is All You Need for RLHF

Starting with the seminal work of Freund \& Schapire (1997), efficient algorithms for computing Nash equilibria of 2p0s games have been a central focus in computational game theory. The usual solution is to run two no-regret algorithms (e.g. Hedge (Freund \& Schapire, 1997) or Online Gradient Descent (Zinkevich, 2003)) against each other, perhaps known more commonly as adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014). When applied to computing MWs, this strategy is known as dueling (Yue et al., 2012) and is commonly applied in the bandit setting. While elegant in theory, this technique inherits all of the notorious instabilities of adversarial training in practice. Even ignoring optimization issues, simply storing both models in memory might be difficult in our current era of "foundation" models (Bommasani et al., 2021). These issues likely explain why dueling techniques have seen limited practical use.

In light of the above difficulties, we ask a simple question: do we actually need two players to compute MWs? We now prove rigorously that we only need a single player due to the anti-symmetry of preference functions. All proofs for this section can be found in Appendix A.

First, we prove that there always exists a symmetric MW.

Lemma 3.1. $\exists(\hat{p}, \hat{q}) \in \operatorname{MW}(\mathcal{P})$ s.t. $\hat{p}=\hat{q}$. [Proof]

Next, we prove that we can compute this symmetric MW by running a single no-regret algorithm against its own iterates. We assume access to the following optimization oracle.

Definition 3.2. $\mathcal{O}$ is a no-regret online linear optimization algorithm over $\Delta(\Pi)$ if it produces iterates $p_{t+1}=$ $\mathcal{O}\left(\ell_{1: t}\right) \in \Delta(\Pi)$ such that, for any sequence of $T$ linear loss functions of the form $\ell_{t}(p)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p}\left[f_{t}(\pi)\right] \in[-1,1]$ (with $f_{t}: \Pi \rightarrow[-1,1]$ ), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{t=1}^{T} \ell_{t}\left(p_{t}\right)-\min _{p^{\star} \in \Delta(\Pi)} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \ell_{t}\left(p^{\star}\right) \leq \operatorname{Reg}(T) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $\lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\operatorname{Reg}(T)}{T}=0$.

Common algorithms like gradient descent satisfy this property (Zinkevich, 2003). See Hazan et al. (2016) for a more
extensive list. We define the SPO Loss at round $t \in[T]$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\ell_{t}^{\mathrm{SPO}}(p) \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p, \pi^{\prime} \sim p_{t}}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right] \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can now state our main result.

Theorem 3.3. Consider a single copy of an algorithm $\mathcal{O}$ which satisfies Definition 3.2. Initialize $p_{1} \in \Delta(\Pi)$ and set $p_{t+1}=\mathcal{O}\left(\ell_{1: t}^{\text {SPO }}\right)$. Then, $\bar{p}=\left(p_{1}+\ldots+p_{T}\right) / T$ is a $\frac{2 \operatorname{Reg}(T)}{T}$-approximate Minimax Winner. [Proof]

For the simplicity of presentation, Theorem 3.3 is stated and proved assuming full feedback, where we observe $\ell_{t}^{\text {SPO }}\left(p_{t}\right)$ at round $t$. In Appendix A.6, we generalize the argument to the more realistic bandit feedback setting, where we only observe a preference $\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)$ for some $\pi, \pi^{\prime}$. The extension uses the standard importance sampling argument to construct an unbiased estimate of the population loss.

Proof Sketch. Consider a pair of strategies, $p, q \in \Delta(\Pi)$. Define $\left.\ell_{t}^{1}(p)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p, \pi^{\prime} \sim q_{t}}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]$ and $\ell_{t}^{2}(q)=$ $\left.\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p_{t}, \pi^{\prime} \sim q}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]$. By the results of Freund \& Schapire (1997), we know that updating $p_{t+1}=\mathcal{O}\left(\ell_{1: t}^{1}\right)$ and $q_{t+1}=$ $\mathcal{O}\left(\ell_{1: t}^{2}\right)$ implies that average strategies $\bar{p}=\frac{1}{t} \sum_{i}^{t} p_{i}, \bar{q}=$ $\frac{1}{t} \sum_{i}^{t} q_{i}$ converge to a Nash equilibrium (Minimax Winner) at the rate of the underlying no-regret algorithm. By construction, we set $p_{0}=q_{0}$. This implies that $\ell_{0}^{1}(p)=$ $\left.\left.\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p, \pi^{\prime} \sim q_{0}}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]=\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p, \pi^{\prime} \sim p_{0}}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]=$ $\left.\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p_{0}, \pi^{\prime} \sim p}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]=\ell_{0}^{2}(p)$ due to the anti-symmetry of $\mathcal{P}$. We now proceed by induction. If, at some time $\tau, p_{\tau}$ and $q_{\tau}$ have the same strategy and perform updates based on the same loss function, for any deterministic $\mathcal{O}$, $p_{\tau+1}=q_{\tau+1}$. For randomized $\mathcal{O}$, our argument still applies as we describe in the full proof. Then, by the anti-symmetry of $\mathcal{P}$, we have that $\ell_{\tau+1}^{1}=\ell_{\tau+1}^{2}$. Hence, by induction, we have that $p_{t}=q_{t}, \forall t \in[T]$. Thus, we only need to simulate a single $p$ with losses $\left.\ell_{t}^{\text {SPO }}(p)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p, \pi^{\prime} \sim p_{t}}\left[-\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right)\right)\right]$ to compute a Minimax Winner.

The above result implies that if we run our algorithm for long enough, we can get arbitrarily close to an exact MW. ${ }^{3}$ Observe that we didn't need to assume we were running a particular algorithm $\mathcal{O}$, rendering the above a reduction of computing minimax winners to no-regret online learning. ${ }^{4}$

The above update can also be viewed from the perspective of a dynamic reward model: it is equivalent to performing an RL step with a policy-dependent reward model:

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{t}^{\mathrm{SPO}}(\xi) \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{\xi^{\prime} \sim \widetilde{p}_{t}}\left[\mathcal{P}\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right)\right] \tag{7}
\end{equation*}
$$[^3]

This reward model incentivizes the learner to play trajectories that are preferred to its current distribution. Gamesolving amounts to repeatedly taking a small step along this direction before (implicitly) updating the reward model. Thus, one can view SPO as using a perfectly shaped curriculum to gently guide the learner. We now pause and further contextualize our results by considering a few questions.

Q1: Do reward-based RLHF algorithms also compute MWs? We prove that this is not the case in general by analyzing multiple algorithms which assume that there exists a reward function that explains the observed preferences

Theorem 3.4. There exists a preference function $\mathcal{P}$ and reference policy $\pi_{r e f}$ such that the optimal policies of rewardbased RLHF and DPO are not the Minimax Winner. [Proof]

Proof Sketch. Consider a unique Minimax Winner of the form $[x, x, 1-2 x]$ for $x \in\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$. Assume $\pi_{\text {ref }}=\left[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right]$. Then, reward-based methods can only pick a reward model that makes (a) one option preferred to all others (resulting in some permutation of $[1,0,0]$ ), making two options preferred to the third (resulting in some permutation of $\left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0\right]$ ) or (c) makes all equally preferred (resulting in $\left[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right]$ ). None of these options can represent the Minimax Winner.

However, by appeal to Equation 7, standard RLHF algorithms / DPO applied iteratively with each batch of preferences collected on-policy and at a sufficiently high frequency may be able to compute MWs on average. That said, for any fixed iteration budget, we would expect preferencebased methods like SPO to better compute MWs because the opponent policy is more "fresh". Even ignoring iteration however, preference models have been shown to generalize better than reward models fit on the same data (Munos et al., 2023). Intuitively, fitting a preference model is learning the static matrix $\mathcal{P}$ while fitting a reward model is learning the dynamic vector $\mathcal{P} p_{t}$, which depends on the current policy and is therefore easier to push out of distribution.

## Q2: If there exists an optimal policy / Copeland Winner

 for my problem, could running SPO be an inefficient way to compute it? We prove that this is not the case in a strong sense: when there exists a clearly optimal policy, our above algorithm converges to it at a fast statistical rate $-\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ instead of the usual $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right)$ average regret. This matches the rates for UCB-style methods, previously been studied in more restricted versions of the dueling setup (Bengs et al., 2021). We give a simpler version of the result here, with a more general form and proof in Appendix A.5.Corollary 3.5 (Informal). Suppose that there exists $\pi^{*} \in$ $\Pi$ such that $\mathcal{P}\left(\pi^{*}, \pi\right)>\Delta$ for all $\pi \neq \pi^{*}$ and $-\Delta \leq$ $\mathcal{P}\left(\pi, \pi^{\prime}\right) \leq \Delta$ for all $\pi, \pi^{\prime} \neq \pi^{*}$. Then, after $T$ rounds, the average solution $\bar{p}$ computed using Hedge as oracle $\mathcal{O}$ and $\ell_{t}^{S P O}$ is an $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{|\Pi|}{\Delta T}\right)$-approximate Minimax Winner.

### 3.4. SPO: Self-Play Preference Optimization.

For single-step problems with a small and discrete policy class, it is common to maintain a distribution over policies / arms. However, as we transition to the sequential setting with a large and often continuous policy class, it is difficult to scale such an approach. We are therefore faced with the question of what is the right no-regret algorithm to optimize the sequence of SPO losses in the RL setting?

To answer this question, we turn to the celebrated idea of local regret minimizers (Zinkevich et al., 2007; Even-Dar et al., 2009). Consider a problem with a finite state space. Then, at each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$, we could independently instantiate a no-regret algorithm that optimizes over $\Delta(\mathcal{A})$, feeding it a loss that depends on the cumulative reward received after exiting the state, i.e. $Q(s, a)$. Then, regardless of the state distribution our resulting policy induces, we can guarantee that we're improving at each iteration. For a specific noregret algorithm (Hedge, Freund \& Schapire (1997)), this leads to the well-known soft policy iteration (SPI) procedure (Ziebart, 2010). Because our reward function is at the trajectory level, we technically need to have a regret minimizer at each history rather than at each state. We describe in Algorithm 1 an instantiation of SPO that uses history-dependent SPI as its policy optimizer (Lines 6-10) and now present a performance guarantee on the learned policy.

Corollary 3.6. With an appropriate setting of $\eta$, running Algorithm 1 for $T$ iterations guarantees $\bar{\pi}$ is a $2 H \sqrt{\frac{2 \log (|\mathcal{A}|)}{T}}$. approximate Minimax Winner.

This follows directly from Lemma C.4. in Xie et al. (2021) and our Theorem 3.3. Of course, in practice, one often uses a deep network to represent their policy rather than the tabular representation we assume in Algorithm 2. It turns out that for certain policy parameterizations, the Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm of Kakade (2001) is exactly equivalent to the soft policy iteration procedure (Agarwal et al., 2021). Many standard deep RL algorithms like TRPO

        Sample $\xi_{t} \sim \pi_{t}$.
        Compute $r_{t}\left(\xi_{t}\right)=\frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{q=1}^{B} \mathcal{P}\left(\xi_{t}, \xi_{q}\right)$.
        Set $r_{t}^{h}=r_{t}\left(\xi_{t}\right) / H, \forall h \in[H]$.

        $Q \leftarrow\left[\xi_{2}, \ldots, \xi_{B}, \xi_{t}\right]$.
    end for
    Return best of $\pi_{1: T}$ on validation data.
```

(Schulman et al., 2015) and PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) are explicitly motivated as approximating NPG, while techniques like SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) can also be viewed as approximate soft policy iteration. Thus, as we move towards a practical approach, we are free to choose from a wide set of standard deep RL techniques as reasonable approximations of our theoretical algorithm.

One other concern we need to resolve is how to do credit assignment with trajectory-level feedback. In fact, if we are unable to provide rewards for each timestep in the problem, our options for policy optimization are quite limited outside of notoriously high variance REINFORCE-style policy gradients (Williams, 1992). We suggest a simple fix to this problem inspired by potential-based reward shaping ( $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al., 1999): just split the trajectory-level reward equally amongst all state-action pairs. We prove in Appendix A that doing so preserves policy optimality.

Lemma 3.7. Consider a trajectory-level reward function $r$ and define $\Pi^{\star}=\operatorname{argmax}_{\pi \in \Pi} \mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim \pi}[r(\xi)]$ as the corresponding set of optimal policies. For all $\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)$ in any $\xi$, let $\tilde{r}\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)=r(\xi) / H$. Then, we have that $\Pi^{\star}=$ $\operatorname{argmax}_{\pi \in \Pi} \mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim \pi}\left[\sum_{h}^{H} \tilde{r}\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)\right]$. [Proof]

In general, such a transformation can cause issues with learning good state-based critics due the fundamentally nonMarkovian nature of a trajectory-level reward. However, we find that in practice, this reward transformation (Line 7 in Algorithm 2) significantly speeds up policy search.

Lastly, in theory, SPO requires sampling multiple trajectories per policy update. In practice, we simply keep a queue $\mathrm{Q}$ of a small, fixed size (typically 10) and use the win rate against this queue for labeling trajectories sampled from the current policy (Line 6 in Algorithm 2). This makes our approach strikingly lightweight to implement on top of any policy optimization method of choice: it is just reward relabeling. We describe our complete approach in Algorithm 2 see Appendix A. 7 for the contextual version.

mental section aims to answer the following questions:

1. Can SPO compute MWs when faced with intransitive preferences? We consider aggregating three populations in different proportions, each of which has transitive preferences internally. We are able to compute the MW in closed form for this discrete action problem and can therefore measure exactly how far off $\mathrm{SPO}$ is from it. We also present qualitative results on a continuous control task from Mujoco, (Brockman et al., 2016) where exactly computing the MW for comparison is infeasible.
2. Can SPO match or exceed RM sample efficiency on problems with unique Copeland Winners / optimal policies? We evaluate SPO and RM with preferences based on ground truth rewards from the DMControl Tassa et al. (2018) continuous control environments. This setting is tailor-made for RM as there exists a deterministic, Markovian reward function that explains the observed preferences.
3. How robust is SPO to stochastic preferences? We study the robustness of RM and SPO to corruptions of various probabilities (i.e. Bernoulli noise) in preference labels. This setup is meant to capture some of the stochasticity in human preferences that makes RLHF challenging in practice.
4. Can SPO handle Non-Markovian preferences? We consider a challenging situation where we want to elicit qualitatively non-Markovian behavior (e.g. constraints on just a part of a trajectory) from a Markovian policy purely on the basis of trajectory-level relative feedback.

To remove any confounds due to data staleness, we allow both of our approaches to query the preference function online, and thus continuously update the RM during the course of running policy search. Thus, RM can be seen as a maximally iterative reward-based method and therefore a rather strong baseline. We use Soft Actor Critic (SAC, Haarnoja et al. (2018)) for continuous control tasks and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO, Schulman et al. (2017)) for discrete action tasks, both as implemented in the ACME framework (Hoffman et al., 2020). The actor, critic sizes and activations are held exactly the same between SPO and RM. Explicitly, the only distinction between SPO and RM is how the reward of a trajectory is estimated and fed into the policy optimization method.

The reward model is Markovian and trained on trajectory level comparisons using trajectories drawn from the agent's replay buffer by optimizing the Bradley-Terry loss (Bradley \& Terry, 1952). During learning, the current reward model is used to label samples that are drawn from the replay buffer (RM) approach along several axes. Specifically, the experi-

Figure 6: We see that when the preferred trajectory is that with the higher ground-truth reward, SPO is able to match and sometimes exceed the sample-efficiency of reward-model based approaches. Standard errors computed over 10 seeds.

Figure 7: We ablate the robustness of SPO and reward-model based approaches to preference feedback being flipped w.p. $\epsilon$. We find that SPO is able to tolerate a greater degree of noise in preferences before failing to approximately match noiseless performance and on average takes an extra 0.1 probability of noise to degrade to the performance of RM.

for performing policy search. The relabeling works better in our experiments than using the rewards assigned when these samples were put into the replay buffer. We keep the reward model architectures consistent with Lee et al. (2021a) and perform extensive sweeps over learning rates and update rules - see Appendix 2 for more details. Due to limited space, we postpone additional results for most experiments to Appendix C.

Intransitive Preferences. We begin by testing whether SPO is actually able to compute MWs in practice via attempting to optimize cyclic (intransitive) preferences.

First, we consider 3 populations, each of which has internally transitive preferences over a discrete set of 3 options. However, when aggregated, their preferences become intransitive, as is common in real-world scenarios (May, 1954). Because this problem is discrete, we can in closed form compute the MW. As we show in Figure 4, SPO is able to almost exactly compute the MW across a variety of sub-population weightings, agreeing with our main theorem, Theorem 3.3.

Next, we consider the Mujoco Ant-v3 navigating atop a 2D plane and consider its radius and angle with respect to the origin at the end of the episode, $(R(\xi), \theta(\xi))$. We consider a preference structure where a trajectory looses to the "pizzaslice" of angle $\bar{\theta}$ in front of them and, within each slice, prefers the "crust" to the "cheese". While we are unable to compute the exact MW here, the symmetry of the preference function over angles implies that the MW qualitatively chooses points uniformly across the slices, while keeping a minimum distance from the center. In Figure 5, we see that over the course of training, our agent matches this behavior on average, continuously sweeping out full circles.

From this point onward, we switch to the DMControl Suite (Tassa et al., 2018) due the greater variety of tasks available.

Maximum Reward Preference. We next consider tasks where the preferences are determined according to comparisons based on the underlying ground truth reward function, i.e. $\mathcal{P}_{1}\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right)=2 \cdot \mathbb{1}\left[r(\xi)>r\left(\xi^{\prime}\right)\right]-1$, where $r(\xi)=\sum_{t=1}^{H} r_{\mathrm{GT}}\left(s_{t}^{\xi}, a_{t}^{\xi}\right)$, with $r_{\mathrm{GT}}\left(s_{t}^{\xi}, a_{t}^{\xi}\right)$ denoting the ground truth reward for the $t^{\text {th }}$ state-action pair in trajectory $\xi$. Naturally, this is the most favorable setting for utilizing an RM based approach, where one might hope to leverage the generalization ability of an RM to perform careful credit assignment for sample efficient learning. However, based on Figure 6, this isn't the case in practice. This dovetails with our Corollary A. 2 on the fast rates enjoyed by SPO when preferences are explained by a reward function. Moreover, for tasks like hopper: st and, we see that the reward model's struggle to learn based on trajectory-level feedback prevents the agent from meaningfully improving.

Noisy Preferences. A natural followup to ground truth reward based preferences is to test the robustness of these methods to noisy preferences (representing annotator disagreements). We study this setting by flipping the maximum reward preference $\mathcal{P}_{1}(\cdot)$ above according to i.i.d Bernoulli noise $k$, i.e. $\mathcal{P}_{2}\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right)=k \cdot \mathcal{P}_{1}\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right)$, where $k \sim \operatorname{Bern}(\epsilon)$.

In Figure 7, we see that $\mathrm{SPO}$ is more robust to noise than RM. Assuming independence between raters, an $\epsilon$ chance of a flip corresponds to a $d=2 \epsilon(1-\epsilon)$ chance of rater disagreement. Thus, we see SPO is consistently able to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_54edf70d112037df06bdg-10.jpg?height=304&width=1678&top_left_y=214&top_left_x=191)

Figure 8: We compare SPO and RM-based approaches on a non-Markovian task: maximize the reward subject to the constraint that the total reward accrued during the last quarter must be at most $r_{\max }$. We see that that $\mathrm{SPO}$ is able to learn policies that exploit their freedom early in the episode while RM is unable to cross the $4 r_{\max }$ threshold

successfully optimize with an $\epsilon=0.3 \Rightarrow d=0.42$ chance of rater disagreement, which matches the levels observed in practice (Taori et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023).

Non-Markovian Preferences. Lastly, we consider a challenging task where we want the agent to maximize their cumulative reward as much as possible subject to the constraint that their total reward in the last quarter of a trajectory is below a threshold $r_{\text {max }}$. Define trajectory-level reward

$r_{3}(\xi)=\left\{\begin{array}{lr}\sum_{h=1}^{H} r\left(s_{h}, a_{h}\right), & \sum_{h=\frac{3}{4} H}^{H} r\left(s_{h}, a_{h}\right) \leq r_{\text {max }} \\ -H, & \text { o.w. }\end{array}\right.$

This induces the following set of preferences:

$$
\mathcal{P}_{3}\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right)=2 \cdot \mathbb{1}\left[r_{3}(\xi)>r_{3}\left(\xi^{\prime}\right)\right]-1
$$

The optimal strategy for this setting is to exhibit qualitatively non-Markovian behavior, i.e. maximize reward as much as possible during the first $\frac{3}{4}$ ths of an episode before switching to more conservative behavior. The reason this is challenging is because we are optimizing over Markovian policies, which means the agent needs to learn an unusually complex mapping. In Figure 8, we see that while SPO is consistently able to cross the $4 r_{\text {max }}$ threshold that corresponds to exhibiting qualitatively non-Markovian behavior, RM is never able to do so. We visualize the difference in the state of SPO-trained agents at the beginning and end of a roll-out on the right of Figure 2 and can see clear differences.

In summary, our experiments show that even when compared to a maximally iterative reward-based method, SPO performs better across a wide set of preference structures.

## 5. Discussion

We provide an algorithm that is minimalist in its lack of reward modeling or adversarial training and maximalist in its robustness to noisy, intransitive, and non-Markovian preferences, as well as compounding errors. Rather than solving the zero-sum game directly, we leverage the structure of the game and follow a simple and stable self-play approach. Our approach is provably efficient and out-performs an iterative reward-model baseline on a suite of continuous control tasks. In the future, we would be interested in leveraging techniques from the imitation learning literature to remove the sample-inefficient RL step and reduce preference model exploitation (Song et al., 2022; Swamy et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2023), and testing out our approach on other problem domains like language modeling or content recommendation. Furthermore, given our method's similarity to interactive imitation learning methods (which are known to be robust to unobserved confounders, Swamy et al. (2022a;b)), it would be interesting to investigate whether our method is better able to handle situations when human preferences are a function of privileged information unobserved by the agent (Siththaranjan et al., 2023).
