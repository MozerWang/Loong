#### Abstract

Are camera poses necessary for multi-view 3D modeling? Existing approaches predominantly assume access to accurate camera poses. While this assumption might hold for dense views, accurately estimating camera poses for sparse views is often elusive. Our analysis reveals that noisy estimated poses lead to degraded performance for existing sparse-view 3D modeling methods. To address this issue, we present LEAP, a novel pose-free approach, therefore challenging the prevailing notion that camera poses are indispensable. LEAP discards pose-based operations and learns geometric knowledge from data. LEAP is equipped with a neural volume, which is shared across scenes and is parameterized to encode geometry and texture priors. For each incoming scene, we update the neural volume by aggregating 2D image features in a feature-similarity-driven manner. The updated neural volume is decoded into the radiance field, enabling novel view synthesis from any viewpoint. On both object-centric and scene-level datasets, we show that LEAP significantly outperforms prior methods when they employ predicted poses from state-of-the-art pose estimators. Notably, LEAP performs on par with prior approaches that use ground-truth poses while running $400 \times$ faster than PixelNeRF. We show LEAP generalizes to novel object categories and scenes, and learns knowledge closely resembles epipolar geometry.


## 1 INTRODUCTION

In 3D vision, camera poses offer powerful explicit geometric priors to connect 3D points and 2D pixels (Zisserman, 2001). Its effectiveness has been verified across a spectrum of 3D vision tasks (Goesele et al., 2006; Geiger et al., 2011), enabling high-quality 3D modeling (Mildenhall et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). However, accurate camera poses are not always available in the real world, and inaccurate poses lead to degraded performance (Lin et al., 2021). To obtain accurate camera poses, one solution is capturing dense views and applying structure-from-motion techniques (Schönberger \& Frahm, 2016). Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, like product images in online stores, we usually observe sparse images captured by wide-baseline cameras. For sparse views, estimating accurate camera poses is still challenging (Zhang et al., 2022). Then a question arises: is using noisy estimated camera poses still the best choice for 3D modeling from sparse and unposed views?

In this paper, we present LEAP, which champions a pose-free paradigm. Instead of pursuing a more accurate camera pose estimator, LEAP challenges the prevailing notion that camera poses are indispensable for 3D modeling. LEAP abandons any operations that explicitly use camera poses, e.g. projection, and learns the pose-related geometric knowledge/representations from data. Thus, LEAP is entirely liberated from camera pose errors, leading to better performance.

LEAP specifically represents each scene as a neural radiance field, which is predicted in a single feed-forward step. To initialize the radiance field, we introduce a neural volume, which is shared across all scenes. Each voxel grid of the volume is parameterized to learn the geometry and texture priors from data. For any incoming scene, the neural volume queries input 2D image features and gets updated through aggregation. Instead of using camera poses to identify source 2D pixels to aggregate (Yu et al., 2021), LEAP leverages attention to aggregate all 2D image features with adaptive weights. Subsequently, LEAP performs spatial-aware attention on the updated neural volume to capture long-range geometry dependency. We iterate the process of aggregating and 3D reasoning, resulting in a refined neural volume. The refined neural volume is then decoded into the radiance field.

An important issue is which reference 3D coordinate frame we should use to define the neural volume. A good choice of this 3D coordinate frame can significantly stabilize and enhance learning (Qi et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2021). As the world coordinate frame for an unposed image set is not well-defined, we instead use a local coordinate frame. Specifically, we choose an arbitrary input image as the canonical view, and the neural volume is defined in its corresponding local camera coordinate. The camera pose of the canonical view is fixed, e.g. as an identity pose, in the local camera coordinate frame. To enable the model aware of the choice of canonical view, we find the key is making 2D image features of non-canonical views consistent with the canonical view. Thus, we design a multi-view encoder to improve the consistency by capturing cross-view 2D correlations.

During training, the canonical view is randomized among all input views. We train LEAP with 2D rendering loss of the input views, using ground-truth camera poses to render them. Note that these ground-truth camera poses are only used during training to learn the mapping from input images to the neural volume. During inference, LEAP predicts the radiance field without reliance on any poses.

We perform a thorough evaluation of LEAP on a diverse array of object-centric (Wu et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2022; Deitke et al., 2022) and scene-level (Jensen et al., 2014) datasets. This assessment spans multiple data scales and incorporates both synthetic and real images. Experimental results highlight LEAP's four interesting properties: i) Superior performance. LEAP consistently synthesizes novel views from $2 \sim 5$ unposed images. It surpasses prior generalizable NeRFs when they use camera poses predicted by SOTA pose estimators. It performs on par with methods using ground-truth camera poses. ii) Fast inference speed. LEAP constructs the radiance field in a feed-forward manner without optimization, running within one second on a single consumer-grade GPU. iii) Strong generalization capability. LEAP models novel-category objects accurately. The model learned on large object-centric datasets transfer well to the scene-level DTU dataset. iv) Interpretable learned priors. While LEAP does not explicitly use camera poses by design, it acquires priors consistent with epipolar geometry. We are committed to releasing code for reproducibility and future research.

## 2 RELATED WORK

NeRF from sparse views with ground-truth camera poses. NeRF variants that work on sparse view inputs can be categorized into two genres. The first is scene-specific NeRFs. Following the original NeRF setting, these methods optimize the radiance field for each scene from scratch. They use additional information to regularize NeRF optimization, e.g., normalization flow (Niemeyer et al., 2022) and frequency regularization (Yang et al., 2023). The second is generalizable NeRF variants (Yu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b; Chen et al., 2021 a), which predict the radiance field in a feed-forward manner. The key is making the radiance fields conditioned on the 2D image features. Typically, these approaches project the 3D points on the input images using camera poses, and information is aggregated from the image features at projected 2D locations. Thus, they are generalizable and transferable to novel scenes by training on curated datasets. However, these methods lack reasoning of correlations between 3D points and assume the access of ground-truth camera poses. In contrast, LEAP has 3D reasoning ability, which works on images without poses.

Sparse-view camera pose estimation. Estimating the camera poses from sparse views presents a significantly greater challenge than from dense views. The complexity arises from the minimal or absent overlap between images, which hampers the formation of cross-view correspondence cues, vital for accurate camera pose estimation (Zisserman, 2001). RelPose (Zhang et al., 2022) highlights the limitations of conventional dense-based camera pose estimation techniques, e.g., COLMAP (Schönberger \& Frahm, 2016), in sparse view contexts. In response, it introduces an energybased model to handle multi-modal solutions indicative of potential camera poses. A subsequent method (Lin et al., 2023) further develops this approach by harnessing multi-view information to

Figure 2: Comparing LEAP with pose-based generalizable NeRFs (Yu et al., 2021). (a) For any 3D point along the casting ray from a target view, pose-based methods project these 3D points onto input source views and aggregate $2 \mathrm{D}$ image features at these projected locations. These methods are sensitive to slight pose inaccuracies, as the errors cause misaligned 3D points and 2D pixels. (b) In contrast, LEAP offers a pose-free method. It defines a parametrized 3D neural volume to encapsulate geometry and texture priors. For any scene, each voxel grid aggregates information from all 2D image pixel, and their feature similarity determines the fusion weight. Features for an inquired 3D point are interpolated from the neighboring voxel grids. This sidestep of pose-dependent operations allows for direct inference on unposed images.

enhance pose estimation accuracy. Concurrently, SparsePose employs a pre-trained foundational model, namely DINO (Caron et al., 2021), to iteratively refine the predictions of noisy camera poses. Besides, researchers also have explored directional representation (Chen et al., 2021b), stronger image matching techniques (Sun et al., 2021) or using image matching priors (Rockwell et al., 2022), and co-visibility (Hutchcroft et al., 2022) to improve the performance. In contrast, our LEAP operates without dedicated camera pose estimation modules.

NeRF with imperfect or no camera poses. Building NeRF from images without precise camera poses is challenging, given that many NeRF variants rely on pose-based geometric operations. To tackle this problem, scene-specific NeRFs (Lin et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021c; Xia et al., 2022) treat camera poses as modifiable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the radiance field. Yet, these methods require dense views, and they either require reasonably accurate initial poses or assume small-baseline cameras to work. NeRS (Zhang et al., 2021) employs surface-based 3D representations as optimization regularizers, suitable for sparse views. However, it is restricted to object-centric data and requires category-specific shape templates. SPARF (Truong et al., 2022) leverages dense 2D image correspondences derived from existing models to augment radiance field optimization. Nevertheless, its efficacy heavily hinges on the precision of both dense correspondences and initial poses. For generalizable NeRF variants, SRT (Sajjadi et al., 2022) proposes a pose-free paradigm building a 2D latent scene representation. However, SRT is not 3D-aware, and its novel view synthesis quality is limited. FORGE (Jiang et al., 2022) jointly estimates camera poses and predicts the radiance field, leveraging their synergy to improve the performance of both. However, the performance is sensitive to pose estimation precision and training FORGE in multi-stages is non-trivial. In contrast, our proposed LEAP benefits from the 3D-aware designs and leans into a feature-similarity-driven 2D-3D information mapping. This approach eliminates reliance on camera poses, yielding results more closely aligned with using ground-truth poses.

## 3 OVERVIEW

We focus on novel view synthesis from sparse views of a scene without camera poses. Prior approaches have adjusted NeRF for sparse views under the assumption of accurate camera poses (Yu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021 a; Niemeyer et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023). Concurrently, enhanced camera pose estimation methods for these sparse images have emerged (Zhang et al., 2022). However, preliminary results for combining the efforts indicate a potential incompatibility; minor pose estimation inaccuracies can significantly degrade the quality of synthesized views in NeRF (Truong et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2022).

We first diagnose the limitations of existing approaches. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the existing generalizable NeRF approaches (Yu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b) rely on camera poses for performing 2D-3D information mapping. Specifically, these methods project a $3 D$ point to its single corresponding 2D locations in each of the input images based on camera poses, and aggregate features at these projected locations. Consequently, any pose inaccuracies distort this 3D-2D association, leading to compromised 3D point features, which are used to predict the radiance.

Figure 3: LEAP overview. LEAP extracts image features of all inputs using a ViT backbone. The first image in the image set is selected as the canonical view. The neural volume is defined in the local camera coordinate of the canonical view, which has learnable parameters to encode geometry and texture priors. To enable LEAP aware of the choice of canonical view, we use a Multi-View Encoder to propagate information from the canonical view to the non-canonical views, making the 2D representations more coherent across views. Then the neural volume is updated by querying the 2D image features of all images using a 2D-3D Information Mapping module. We decode the neural volume into the radiance field and render novel views at inference time.

In contrast, LEAP proposes a novel pose-free paradigm, eliminating the influence of any pose inaccuracies. At its core, LEAP establishes the 3D-2D association based on feature similarities, enabling a 3D point to aggregate information from all pixels, rather than its 2D projection only. For each 3D voxel grid, the pose-free aggregation will learn to adaptively assign larger weights to its corresponding 2D pixels. We introduce the details of LEAP architecture in the following section.

## 4 METHOD

We present the task formulation and the overview of LEAP. Given a set of $k$ 2D image observations of a scene, represented as $\left\{I_{i} \mid i=1, \ldots, k\right\}$, LEAP predicts a neural radiance field (Mildenhall et al., 2020), which enables synthesizing a 2D image from an arbitrary target viewpoint. Note that in our setup of sparse source views captured by wide-baseline cameras, the number $k$ is typically less than 5. Moreover, these views are presented without any associated camera pose information at inference.

### 4.1 MODEL ARCHITECTURE

As illustrated in Fig. 3, LEAP initiates by extracting 2D image features from all views. We use a DINOv2-initialized ViT (Oquab et al., 2023; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) as the feature extractor since it demonstrates strong capability in modeling cross-view correlations (Zhang et al., 2023). We denote the image features of $I_{i}$ as $f_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times w \times c}$, and the resulting features set for all input views as $\left\{f_{i} \mid i=1, \ldots, k\right\}$. Due to the unawareness of the world coordinate frame on unposed images, we perform 3D modeling in a local camera coordinate frame. Specifically, we designate one image as the canonical view, where the neural volume and radiance field are defined in its local coordinate frame. During training, we randomly select a canonical view and denote it as $I_{1}$ for notation clarity.

To make LEAP aware of the choice of the canonical view, we find the key is to make the features of the non-canonical views consistent with the canonical view. We propose a multi-view image encoder to improve the feature consistency. Then, LEAP introduces a learnable neural volume, which is shared across scenes, to encode the geometric and textural prior. The neural volume serves as the initial 3D representation for all scenes. For each incoming scene, by querying the multi-view features, LEAP maps the 2D information to the 3D domain, represented by an updated neural volume. Finally, LEAP predicts the radiance field from the updated neural volume. We describe each step as follows.

Multi-view Image Encoder enables LEAP aware of the choice of the canonical view, by performing multi-view information reasoning. It takes in image features of all views and refines them by capturing cross-view correlations. It consists of $n_{e}$ blocks, and each block has two layers: a Non-canonical View Update (NVU) layer and a Global Consensus Reasoning (GCR) layer. The NVU layer updates each of the non-canonical view features by aggregating the canonical view features. It is denoted as $\bar{f}_{j}=\mathrm{NVU}\left(f_{j}, f_{1}\right)$, where $j \neq 1$ and $\bar{f}$ denotes the updated features. The GCR layer performs joint reasoning on all views for a global consensus, which leverages the correlation between all views.

We implemented the two layers with Transformer layers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Specifically, the NVU layer is modeled as a Transformer layer with cross-attention, where the non-canonical view features are queries, and the canonical view features are keys/values. It is formulated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left[\bar{f}_{2}, \ldots, \bar{f}_{k}\right]=\operatorname{FFN}\left(\operatorname{CrossAttention}\left(\left[f_{2}, \ldots, f_{k}\right], f_{1}\right)\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where FFN is a feed-forward network, and [.] denotes the concatenating operation over tokenized image features. For clarity, $\left[\bar{f}_{2}, \ldots, \bar{f}_{k}\right]$ is in $\mathbb{R}^{(k-1) h w \times c}$ and $f_{1}$ is flattened into $\mathbb{R}^{h w \times c}$.

Similarly, the GCR layer is instantiated by a Transformer layer with self-attention, where the query, key, and value are the $2 \mathrm{D}$ image features of all views. It is formulated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left[\tilde{f}_{1}, \ldots, \tilde{f}_{k}\right]=\operatorname{FFN}\left(\operatorname{SelfAttention}\left(\left[f_{1}, \bar{f}_{2}, \ldots, \bar{f}_{k}\right]\right)\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Specifically, $\left[\tilde{f}_{1}, \ldots, \tilde{f}_{k}\right]$ is in $\mathbb{R}^{k h w \times c}$. For simplicity, we denote the final output $\left[\tilde{f}_{1}, \ldots, \tilde{f}_{k}\right]$ as $\mathbf{F}$.

2D-3D Information Mapping. LEAP introduces a 3D latent neural volume $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times D \times c}$ to encode the geometry and texture priors, where $H, W, D$ are the spatial resolution of the volume. It is defined in the local camera coordinate of the canonical view. The neural volume is shared across different scenes and gets updated by mapping the 2D image information to the 3D domain.

To perform the 2D-3D information mapping, we use $n_{m}$ Transformer Decoder blocks (Vaswani et al., 2017), each of which consists of a cross-attention layer and a self-attention layer. In the crossattention layer, we use the 3D latent volume $\mathbf{V}$ as the query and use $\mathbf{F}$ as the key/value. The updated 3D neural volume $\overline{\mathbf{V}}$ is defined as $\overline{\mathbf{V}}=\mathrm{FFN}(\operatorname{CrossAttention}(\mathbf{V}, \mathbf{F}))$. Intuitively, for each 3D point belonging to the neural volume, we compute its feature similarity with all 2D image features and use the similarity to get the weighted average of 2D image features. Subsequently, the self-attention layer performs refinement on the 3D volume features, capturing long-range geometry correlation. With multiple 2D-3D information lifting blocks, we reconstruct the latent volume of the objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. We denote the updated neural volume as $\tilde{\mathbf{V}} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times D \times c}$.

Neural Rendering. With the updated neural volume $\tilde{\mathbf{V}}$, LEAP predicts a volume-based neural radiance field (Yu et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022). The radiance field is denoted as $\mathbf{R}:=\left(\mathbf{R}_{\sigma}, \mathbf{R}_{f}\right)$, where $\mathbf{R}_{\sigma}$ and $\mathbf{R}_{f}$ are the density and features of the radiance field. $\mathbf{R}_{\sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{H^{\prime} \times W^{\prime} \times D^{\prime}}$ and $\mathbf{R}_{f} \in \mathbb{R}^{H^{\prime} \times W^{\prime} \times D^{\prime} \times C}$, where $H^{\prime}, W^{\prime}$, and $D^{\prime}$ are spatial resolutions. Both $\mathbf{R}_{\sigma}$ and $\mathbf{R}_{f}$ are predicted from $\tilde{\mathbf{V}}$ using 3D convolution layers. We read out the rendered image $\hat{I}$ and object mask $\hat{\sigma}$ using volumetric rendering techniques (Mildenhall et al., 2020). In detail, we first render a feature map and predict the rendered image using 2D convolutions. Formally, $(\hat{I}, \hat{\sigma})=\Pi(\mathbf{R}, \Phi)$, where $\Pi$ denotes the volumetric rendering process, and $\Phi$ is the target camera pose.

### 4.2 TRAINING AND INFERENCE OF LEAP

Training. LEAP is trained with the photo-metric loss between the rendering results and the inputs without any 3D supervision. We first define the loss $L_{I}$ applied on the RGB images, where $L_{I}=$ $\Sigma_{i} L_{m s e}\left(\hat{I}_{i}, I_{i}\right)+\Sigma_{i} \lambda_{p} L_{p}\left(\hat{I}_{i}, I_{i}\right)$. The $L_{m s e}$ is the MSE loss, $I_{i}$ and $\hat{I}_{i}$ are the original and rendered input images, $\lambda_{p}$ is a hyper-parameter used for balancing losses, and $L_{p}$ is the perceptual loss (Johnson et al., 2016). We then define the loss $L_{M}$ applied on the density masks, as $L_{M}=\Sigma_{i} L_{m s e}\left(\hat{\sigma}_{i}, \sigma_{i}\right)$, where $\hat{\sigma}_{i}$ and $\sigma_{i}$ are original and rendered density masks. The final loss is defined as $L=L_{I}+\lambda_{m} L_{M}$, where $\lambda_{m}$ is the weight balancing hyperparameter. We only use $L_{I}$ if the masks are not available.

Inference and Evaluation. During inference, LEAP predicts the radiance field without reliance on any poses. To evaluate the novel view synthesis quality, we use the testing camera poses to render the radiance field under specific viewpoints.

## 5 EXPERIMENT

We introduce our evaluation results on diverse and large-scale datasets, including both object-centric and scene-level datasets, for comparison with prior arts.

Implementation Details. We consider the number of views to be $k=5$, with image resolution 224 . We set $\lambda_{p}=0.1$ and $\lambda_{m}=5.0$. We set the peak learning rate as $2 e-5$ (for the backbone) and $2 e-4$ (for other components) with a warmup for 500 iterations using AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov \&

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_63e8726a9a48cbee6958g-06.jpg?height=364&width=1390&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=365)

Figure 4: Visualization of LEAP results on the object-centric Omniobject3D dataset. For each instance, we include one out of five (denoted as " $1 / 5$ ") input views and two novel views. See more results in the supplementary.

Hutter, 2017). We train the model for 150k iterations and use a linear learning rate scheduler, where the batch size is 32 . LEAP has $n_{e}=2$ multi-view encoder blocks and $n_{m}=42 \mathrm{D}-3 \mathrm{D}$ mapping blocks. The resolution of the 3D neural volume and the volume-based radiance fields are $16^{3}$ and $64^{3}$, respectively. We sample 64 points on each ray for rendering.

Datasets. We train LEAP on each of the following datasets and test its capability to model the 3D object/scenes on each dataset that has different properties. We note that the poses of object-centric datasets are randomly sampled, leading to wide camera baselines of input views.

- OmniObject3D (Wu et al., 2023) contains daily objects from 217 categories. We use a subset with 4800 instances for training and 498 instances for testing. OmniObject3D contains objects with complicated and realistic textures.
- Kubric-ShapeNet (Jiang et al., 2022) is a synthetic dataset generated using Kubric (Greff et al., 2022). Its training set has 1000 instances for each of 13 ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015) categories, resulting in 13000 training samples. Its test set is composed of two parts: i) 1300 object instances from training categories; ii) 1000 object instances from 10 novel object categories. The two subsets are used to test the reconstruction quality and generalization ability of models. This dataset contains objects with complicated geometry but simple textures.
- Objaverse (Deitke et al., 2022) is one of the largest object-centric datasets. We use a subset of $200 k$ and $2 k$ instances for training and testing, used to validate LEAP on large-scale data.
- DTU dataset (Jensen et al., 2014) is a real scene-level dataset. DTU is on a small scale, containing only 88 scenes for training, which tests the ability of LEAP to fit small-scale data.

Metrics. Following previous works, we use standard novel view synthesis metrics, including PSNR (in dB), SSIM (Wang et al., 2004) and LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018).

Baselines. We compare LEAP with the following baselines. We note that we train each baseline model (except zero123) on each of the datasets using the same setting with LEAP for fair comparisons. We use official or officially verified implementations of all baselines.

- PixelNeRF (Yu et al., 2021) is a generalizable NeRF variant, using camera poses to correlate 3D points and 2D pixels. We experiment with both ground-truth poses and predicted poses (with ground-truth translations) from a state-of-the-art pose estimator RelPose (Zhang et al., 2022).
- FORGE (Jiang et al., 2022) is a generalizable NeRF variant with test-time optimization, which jointly predicts camera poses and the neural radiance field, and leverages their synergy to improve the performance of both. We experiment with FORGE using ground-truth and its predicted poses.
- SPARF (Truong et al., 2022) is scene-specific NeRF variant that jointly optimizes the camera poses and the radiance field. It requires reasonable pose initialization and is dependent on dense visual correspondences predicted from off-the-shelf methods.
- SRT (Sajjadi et al., 2022) uses only 2D representation to perform novel view synthesis. It is trained and tested on unposed image sets.
- Zero123 (Liu et al., 2023) is a novel view synthesis method using diffusion models. We note that Zero123 takes a single image as input, which is different from LEAP and other baselines. We test Zero123 to compare LEAP with large-scale 2D models.


### 5.1 COMPARISONS WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART

Object-centric Results. The results are shown in Table 1. On all four test sets, LEAP outperforms all prior pose-free works and pose-based works (with estimated poses). The results demonstrate the success of LEAP for modeling objects with different geometry and texture properties. In detail,

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_63e8726a9a48cbee6958g-07.jpg?height=483&width=1393&top_left_y=279&top_left_x=363)

Figure 5: Comparison with prior arts. The performance of PixelNeRF degenerates dramatically with the stateof-the-art pose estimator. FORGE benefits from its joint optimization of shape and pose, but the high-frequency details are lost. SRT can only recover noisy results. Zero123 can synthesize high-quality images, while the content is not consistent with the inputs. In contrast, LEAP reliably recovers the details and the novel views match the ground-truth target view well. We also include zoom in results on the right for a clearer comparison.

Table 1: Evaluation on four object-centric test sets. We include the inference time of each method. $\boldsymbol{X}$ means the method is pose-free. For experiments without using perfect poses, We highlight the best and second-best results. For experiments with perfect poses, we also highlight the best GT pose result if it is better than ours.

LEAP improves over the next-best baseline (FORGE) by about $3 \mathrm{~dB}$ PSNR and $50 \%$ LPIPS relatively on all datasets. Furthermore, without the need for any test-time refinement, the running speed of LEAP is significantly faster than FORGE (0.3-second v.s. 15 min). Besides, LEAP demonstrates strong generalization capability, as the model trained on the Kubric ShapeNet dataset of only 13 categories is able to work on novel ShapeNet categories with nearly no gap.

Interestingly, when compared with prior pose-based methods using ground-truth poses, LEAP exhibits a comparable or even better performance. This result verifies our proposition that camera poses may not be necessary for 3D modeling, at least in the sparse-view setting. We present a visualization of our results in Fig. 4 and comparison with prior works in Fig. 5.

Scene-level Results. The results are shown in Table 2. Since the DTU dataset is too small to train a usable pose estimator, we follow SPARF to use different levels of noisy poses. Our method outperforms PixelNeRF with noisy poses and achieves comparable results with SPARF. We note that SPARF is a scene-specific NeRF variant that takes much longer time to optimize the radiance field and requires additional inputs, i.e. accurate dense visual correspondences between input views. We include a qualitative comparison in Fig. 6.

Besides, we also observe that a compelling phenomenon - a LEAP model pre-trained on the largescale object-centric datasets largely improves its performance on the scene-level evaluation. The reason is that as a pose-free method with our geometric inductive bias, LEAP requires learning the knowledge on larger data compared with pose-based works. Training from scratch on the small-scale DTU dataset, which only contains 88 scenes for training, leads to unsatisfying performance. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the pre-training demonstrates the capability of LEAP to learn general-purpose 3D knowledge, which is generalizable and can be transferred to novel domains.

### 5.2 Ablation StudY and INSIGHTS

We present an ablation study on each block of LEAP to study their impacts.

Figure 6: Comparison with prior arts on DTU dataset. PixelNeRF collapses under noisy poses. SPARF recovers high-frequency details well, but it degenerates when the correspondences are not accurate and demonstrates strong artifacts (shown in red boxes). LEAP reliably recovers the geometry well but lacks texture details. The result implies that LEAP, as a pose-free method, requires larger training datasets.

Table 2: Evaluation on the DTU dataset. LEAP performs on par with SPARF which requires slow per-scene optimization and additional dense image correspondence inputs. Numbers with $*$ are after SPARF optimization.

Coordinate Frame. We study the importance of the local camera coordinate frame by using the world coordinate frame instead. We use the category-level coordinate as the world coordinate, where objects have aligned rotation and are zero-centered. As shown in Table 3 (a), the model demonstrates better performance on the seen object categories (with 31.23 v.s. 29.10 PSNR) but generalizes worse on novel categories. We conjecture the reason is that the aligned rotation/translation world coordinate frame makes it easier to perform 2D-3D information mapping for training categories. However, it also limits the performance of novel categories, as their category-level coordinate frames are not learned by LEAP. This result matches our intuition of using the local camera coordinate frame to define the neural volume, which enables LEAP to generalize to any objects/scenes.

Multi-view Encoder. We explore the impact of using the multi-view encoder to make LEAP aware of the choice of the canonical view. We test the following alternatives: i) LEAP without the multi-view encoder; ii) LEAP that only has the global consensus reasoning (GCR) layers; iii) LEAP that only has the non-canonical view update (NVU) layers. As shown in Table 3 (b)-(d), without the multi-view encoder, we observe a significant performance drop. The reason is that the inconsistent features across views hamper the 2D-3D information mapping. Similarly, only with the GCR layers, LEAP struggles determining which view is the canonical view. When only using the NVU layers, it achieves a slightly worse performance than the full model. The experiments show the effectiveness of using the multi-view encoder to make the model aware of the choice of canonical view.

The 2D-3D Information Mapping Layer. As shown in Table 3 (e), using two mapping layers (the default has four layers) slightly degenerates the performance, which shows its efficacy.

Interpreting LEAP. We perform visualization to understand what knowledge LEAP learns to handle the absence of camera poses. As shown in Fig. 7, LEAP adaptively assigns weights to reasonable $2 \mathrm{D}$ regions to perform 2D-2D reasoning and 2D-3D information mapping. The neural volume is updated in a coarse-to-fine manner during the process. Moreover, we test how the learned knowledge is related to explicit pose-based operations. As shown in Fig. 8, we input images of a small dot. We find that LEAP lifts the 2D pixel of the dot into the 3D space as a line segment. The location of the line segment projected in another view corresponds to its epipolar line. The phenomenon reveals that LEAP lifts a 2D point as its reprojection ray, and it leverages multiview information to resolve the ambiguity of the ray to determine the depth of the 2D point. Besides,

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_26_63e8726a9a48cbee6958g-09.jpg?height=420&width=1393&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=363)

Figure 7: Visualization of LEAP working mechanism. (Left) We show the 2D-2D attention weights of the multi-view encoder. For each query pixel (in red) in the canonical view, it assigns larger weights to the corresponding regions in the Non-canonical views. The attention of query points in the background diffuses. (Middle) We visualize the learned neural volume by using PCA and slicing along the three axes. As our 3D modeling happens in the local coordinate frame, which is not axis-aligned, the learned embeddings show isotropic properties. The neural volume is refined in a coarse-to-fine manner, where the object boundary becomes more compact after more mapping layers. (Right) We show the attention map between 3D-2D. As shown in the top two rows, the neighbor on-surface voxels have similar attention patterns on a specific 2D object region. The attention of an out-of-object voxel diffuses on the background 2D region. See more details in the supplementary.

Figure 8: Interpret LEAP. Top: We input images of a small dot (in orange boxes), and the visualization of the reconstructed neural volume shows consistency with the epipolar lines of the small dot on target views. This implies LEAP mapps a 2D point as its 3D reprojection ray segment even though there are no reprojection operations. It leverages the multiview information to resolve the depth ambiguity of the ray. Bottom: The performance with different numbers of inputs on Omniobject3D. Note that we only train the model with 5 images and it is directly tested.

we show LEAP performance with different numbers of input images. The results show that LEAP reliably reconstructs the object with two to five images, and its performance drops slightly with fewer inputs. However, we observe a big drop when we decrease the number of inputs from two images to one image. These results validate the effectiveness of LEAP in using multi-view information to perform the 3D modeling.

## 6 CONCLUSION

We propose LEAP, a pose-free approach for 3D modeling from a set of unposed sparse-view images. By appropriately setting the 3D coordinate and aggregating 2D image features, LEAP demonstrates satisfying novel view synthesis quality. In our experiments, spanning from both objectcentric to scene-level, from synthetic images to real images, and from small-scale to large-scale data, LEAP consistently demonstrates better performance compared with prior pose-based works that use estimated poses or noisy poses. LEAP also achieve comparable results with the versions of prior works that use ground-truth poses. Besides, LEAP showcases a strong generalization capability, fast inference speed, and interpretable learned knowledge.

Limitations. LEAP adopts the neural volume representation where the 3D voxel grids span uniformly in the 3D space, and the physical size of the volume is bounded. Designing better 3D representation, e.g. incorporating techniques from prior works to enable it to work on unbounded scenes, will further benefit the application of LEAP.
