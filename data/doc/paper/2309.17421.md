#### Abstract

Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision) [99-101, 1] ${ }^{1}$, to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new humancomputer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the model under our study is solely the product of OpenAI's innovative work, and they should be fully credited for its development.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Overview

The breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) [23, 99, 30, 11, 123, 53] have shown remarkable versatilities and capabilities across various domains and tasks. The next evolution in this field, large multimodal models (LMMs), aims to expand upon the capabilities of LLMs by integrating multi-sensory skills to achieve even stronger general intelligence. Given the dominance of the visual in human senses [33, 58], many LMM studies start with extending the vision capability. Preliminary research investigations either finetune a vision encoder to align with a frozen pre-trained LLM [125, 7, 71, 55, 42, 13, 48, 157, 79, 35, 146], or use a vision-language model to convert visual inputs to text descriptions that LLMs can understand [149, 141, 131, 54, 113, 142]. However, most existing models $[13,48,157,79,35,69]$ are of limited model and data scales, potentially restricting the emergence of various intriguing abilities. Consequently, it remains unclear what are the status quo and emergent multimodal abilities of LMMs that are developed based on the state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4 (no vision) [99] and PaLM [30, 11]. In this paper, we report our preliminary explorations with (an early version of) GPT-4V, a state-of-the-art LMM with vision, built based on the SOTA LLM and trained with a large scale of multimodal data.

Our exploration of GPT-4V is guided by the following questions.

1. What are GPT-4V's supported inputs and working modes? The genericity of multimodal models inevitably requires the system to work with the arbitrary mix of different input modalities. GPT-4V shows unprecedented ability in understanding and processing an arbitrary mix of input images, sub-images, texts, scene texts, and visual pointers. We also demonstrate that GPT-4V well supports the test-time techniques observed in LLMs, including instruction following [102], chain-of-thoughts [136, 66], in-context few-shot learning [23], etc.
2. What are the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities on different domains and tasks? We sample queries covering a wide range of domains and tasks to understand GPT-4V's capabilities, including open-world visual understanding, visual description, multimodal knowledge, commonsense, scene text understanding, document reasoning, coding, temporal reasoning, abstract reasoning, emotion understanding, and many more. GPT-4V shows impressive human-level capabilities across many of the experimented domains.
3. What are effective ways to use and prompt GPT-4V? GPT-4V is strong in understanding pixel space edits, such as visual pointers and scene texts drawn on input images. Inspired by this capability, we discuss the "visual referring prompting" that directly edits input images to instruct the task of interest. Visual referring prompting can be seamlessly used together with other image and text prompts, presenting a nuanced interface for instruction and example demonstrations.
4. What are promising future directions? Given GPT-4V's strong capability across domains and tasks, we ask what is the next step for multimodal learning, and more broadly for artificial intelligence. We organize our thoughts and explorations into two perspectives, i.e., emergent novel application scenarios to focus on, and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We present our preliminary explorations to inspire future studies.

Guided by the aforementioned problems, we comprehensively organize and list our explored qualitative results. The report contains minimal quantitative benchmark results, and instead consists of mainly selected interesting qualitative examples. Despite being less rigorous, this design allows for providing a more comprehensive analysis covering a broad range of domains, tasks, working modes, and prompting techniques, under a fixed capacity. We believe this organized collection of explorations will inspire future works in emerging novel applications, next-generation multimodal task formulation, and developing advanced LMM-based intelligent systems.

### 1.2 Our Approach in Exploring GPT-4V

Goal of this report. The standard approach for evaluating a system is by benchmarking it against a series of carefully designed datasets, each representing a specific domain and task. One challenge is that some of the existing benchmarks may not be suitable for evaluating LMMs anymore. For example,
the image captioning outputs of LMMs are much richer and contain more detailed descriptions than the ground truths in the image captioning benchmark datasets [27]. There is also a lack of public information regarding GPT-4V's large-scale pre-training, which may violate the train-test setup for certain existing datasets and invalidate those benchmark numbers. Because of this, restricting the evaluation to existing benchmarks and metrics may unintentionally narrow the scope of GPT-4V's assessment. Developing a comprehensive list of next-generation evaluation tasks and benchmarks would be the ideal ultimate solution. However, we left those as future work due to the significant efforts required.

In lieu of quantitative benchmarking, this paper focuses on using qualitative results to provide a glimpse of GPT-4V's new capabilities and potential emerging use cases. Our goal is to discover and preview what GPT-4V might already be capable of, even though these novel capabilities may not yet be entirely reliable. We hope this collection of explorations will inspire future research in establishing quantitative benchmarks for next-generation multimodal tasks, modernizing existing benchmarks, further improving model performance and system reliability, and sparkling innovation in emerging use cases. Following this, we will delve into the core designs for our approach to exploring GPT-4V.

Sample selection guidance. This report focuses on presenting qualitative results to showcase the potential capabilities of GPT-4V, rather than providing comprehensive quantitative benchmark results. This naturally raises the question of the reliability of the showcased examples. The examples featured in this report may require careful instruction tuning to amplify GPT-4V's corresponding capabilities. It should be noted that some complex cases may only work with the specifically designed prompts. As such, the capabilities demonstrated may not consistently work across different samples. Instead of showing only the reliable functionalities, the primary objective of this report is to provide readers with a list of our discovered potential capabilities of GPT-4V, which might otherwise be overlooked after a few unsuccessful trials.

Sample selection to prevent mere memorizing from training. A fundamental design consideration in qualitative reports [24] is discerning models' true capabilities from merely memorizing responses from training samples or making educated guesses based on hints from instructions and in-context examples. We carefully control both the images and text in the input prompts to prevent them from being seen during GPT-4V training. We generate original text queries from scratch, and try to use images that are either not accessible online or with a timestamp beyond April 2023. We will indicate instances where a specific sample does not meet this criterion, e.g., deliberately using samples from specific vision-language datasets. Beyond ensuring that samples are unseen, we incorporate rationale queries into the process. These queries are designed to probe the model's reasoning process, thereby validating GPT-4V's possession of the intended capability.

The default working mode. As later detailed in Section 3, GPT-4V works effectively in different working modes, including zero-shot learning with instructions, in-context few-shot learning, etc. Among them, this report primarily focuses on zero-shot instruction tuning, as opposed to in-context few-shot learning. This design is to prevent potential information leakage from in-context examples. While in-context few-shot examples can enhance performance and reliability, they do not consistently engender new capabilities. As such, we designate zero-shot as the default working mode for presentation, and reduce the use of in-context examples to minimize examples' impacts on the assessed capabilities.

### 1.3 How to Read this Report?

This report documents the explorations of GPT-4V conducted by researchers in the computer vision and vision-language multimodal field. It is primarily geared towards fellow researchers in related disciplines who seek to gain a qualitative impression of LMM's capabilities and understand its difference from traditional vision-language models. The report is also prepared for professionals for whom AI or computer science may be outside their specialties, to assist them in conceptualizing ways LMMs can enhance their proficiency within their distinct domains of expertise.

We give an overview of the report, structured around the four core questions that guide our exploration.

1. What are GPT-4V's supported inputs and working modes? Section 2 summarizes GPT-4V's supported inputs and presents an overview of their corresponding use cases. Based on the flexible interleaved image-text inputs, Section 3 discusses GPT-4V's different working modes, such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and other emergent usages.

The section covers the novel ways of using and prompting GPT-4V, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of how we will use GPT-4V in subsequent sections.

2. What are the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities on different domains and tasks? The exploration of this question makes up a large portion of the report. Section 4 provides a comprehensive analysis covering a wide range of vision and vision-language scenarios, including image description and recognition on different domains, dense visual understanding, multimodal knowledge, commonsense, scene text understanding, document reasoning, and many more. We also separate out several novel and interesting capabilities. Section 6 studies GPT-4V's capability in temporal, motion, and video understanding. Section 7 explores the abstract visual understanding and reasoning capability, and Section 8 covers the emotion and sentiment understanding.
3. What are effective ways to use and prompt GPT-4V? We start the discussion on this question from the working mode and prompting method introduction in Section 3. In Section 5, we highlight one novel promoting technique, namely visual referring prompting, which draws visual pointers and scene texts on input images to prompt GPT-4V. We demonstrate the flexible prompting methods, such as the combination of instruction and example demonstrations, throughout the report in the given examples.
4. What are promising future directions? Section 9 focuses on the novel use cases facilitated by GPT-4V. We hope these initial examples could inspire future works to design new task setups and present rigorous benchmarks. Section 10 imagines powerful future systems that can be built based on GPT-4V, such as the multimodal plugins, multimodal chains, self-reflection, self-consistency, and retrieval-augmented LMMs, etc.

In addition to this overview and the table of contents, we have also included a list of figures. The list enumerates the qualitative examples detailed within the report, serving as an additional tool to help readers navigate to their scenarios of interest.

## 2 GPT-4V's Input Modes

This section summarizes GPT-4V's supported inputs, i.e., functioning as a uni-model language model with the text-only inputs, taking single image-text pair optionally with only a single image, and taking interleaved image-text pairs optionally with only multiple image inputs. We next highlight the representative use cases under these different input modes.

### 2.1 Text-only Inputs

GPT-4V's strong language capability enables it to serve as an effective unimodal language model [ 38 , $108,23]$ with text-only inputs. Operating exclusively with text for both input and output, GPT-4V is capable of performing a wide variety of language and coding tasks. We refer readers to the GPT-4 technical report [99] for the comprehensive and in-depth analysis of GPT-4V's language and coding capabilities, as well as the comparison with GPT-4 (no vision).

### 2.2 Single Image-text Pair

GPT-4V, the latest large multimodal model, takes images and texts as inputs to generate textual outputs. In line with existing general-purpose vision-language models [9, 81, 73, 8, 70, 122, 120, $155,28,83,45,74,57,64,72,132,29,140,41,7,128,46,40,158,69]$, GPT-4V can take a single image-text pair or a single image as input to perform various vision and vision-language tasks, such as image recognition [37], object localization [153], image captioning [27], visual question answering [12], visual dialogue [36], dense caption [62], and so on. We note that the text in the image-text pair can be used either as instruction like "describe the image" for captioning, or as the query input like the question in visual question answering. GPT-4V's exceptional intelligence is exemplified by its significantly enhanced performance and generalizability compared to prior arts. A comprehensive analysis of its multimodal capabilities on various domains is detailed in Section 4.

## Sec. 2.3 Interleaved Image-text Inputs

Interleaved Image-text Pairs

In the first receipt, you paid $\$ 3.72$ for tax. The information is located at the bottom of the receipt. In the second receipt, you paid $\$ 42.23$ for tax. The information is located near the bottom of the receipt, under the "Sales Tax" line. In the third receipt, you paid $\$ 4.58$ for tax. The information is located at the bottom of the receipt, under the "TAX" line. In total, you paid $\$ 50.53$ in tax across all three receipts.
Prompt:

How much should I pay for the beer on the table according to the price on the menu?

GPT-4V:

According to the menu, the price for a Magna beer is $\$ 6$. Since there are two Magna beers on the table, the total cost for the beers would be $\$ 12$.

Figure 1: GPT-4V can work with multi-image and interleaved image-text inputs. Check Section 2.3 for detailed discussions.

### 2.3 Interleaved Image-text Inputs

The generality of GPT-4V is further enhanced by its ability to handle flexibly interleaved image-text inputs. The interleaved image-text inputs can be either visually centric such as multiple images with a short question or instruction, text-centric such as a long webpage with two inserted images, or a balanced mixture of images and texts. This mode of mixed input provides flexibility for a wide array of applications. For example, it can compute the total tax paid across multiple receipt images, as shown in Figure 1. It also enables processing multiple input images and extracting queried information. GPT-4V could also effectively associate information across interleaved image-text inputs, such as finding the beer price on the menu, counting the number of beers, and returning the total cost, as shown in Figure 1. Beyond direct applications, processing interleaved image-text inputs serves as a fundamental component for in-context few-shot learning and other advanced test-time prompting techniques, thereby further boosting GPT-4V's generality. We demonstrate these intriguing novel usages in the next section, Section 3.

GPT-4V:

The missing image would likely be a variation of the diamond or star shape, as seen in the other three images. It could be a diamond with a different pattern or color, or a star with a different number of points or color. It is difficult to say for sure without more context, but it would likely follow the same theme as the other images.

## Prompt:

Here are three sub images arranged in a 2-by-2 matrix. First, look at the two images in the first column, in the top left and bottom left. Then, find out the pattern in the first column based on the left two images. Next, use the found pattern and the image in the top right to infer the missing figure. Finally, describe what would the missing image look like?

GPT-4V:

The pattern in the first column is that the shape in the bottom left image has a dot in the center of the shape in the top left image. Therefore, the missing image in the bottom right would be a star with a dot in the center, similar to the image in the top right but with a dot in the center.

### 3.1 Following Text Instructions

One unique strength of GPT-4V is its generality, partially achieved via its strong capability in understanding and following text instructions $[102,96,134,111]$. Instructions provide a natural way to define and customize the desired output text for arbitrary vision-language use cases. Figure 2 shows an example of image descriptions with constraints on sentence length and the words to use. Alternatively, on the input side, GPT-4V could understand the detailed instructions to perform challenging tasks, such as enabling GPT-4V to better interpret the abstract reasoning question by providing instructions on intermediate steps. The ability to learn new tasks from instructions shows great potential in adapting to various unseen applications and tasks, as detailed in Section 9. In line with recent studies $[7,13,48,157,79,35]$, the instructions discussed in this subsection are mostly in the text format, providing language descriptions of the interested task. We will discuss GPT-4V's unique capability of following multimodal example-grounded instructions later in Section 3.3.

In addition, we showcase how text instructions play an important role in shaping GPT-4V's response with two techniques adopted from LLM literature [3, 156], (i) "constrained prompting" so that GPT-4V responds in a certain format; and (ii) "condition on good performance" that explicitly asks for good performance from GPT-4V.

Constrained prompting. In Figure 3, we prompt GPT-4V to read the text in the image and return the information in a specific JSON format. Although GPT-4V makes some mistakes in extracting the corresponding information from driver's licenses, the responses are constrained to the JSON format specified in the text instruction. We leverage this technique for certain application scenarios in Section 9 .

Condition on good performance. One observation about LLMs is that LLMs don't want to succeed [10]. Rather, they want to imitate training sets with a spectrum of performance qualities. If the user wants to succeed in a task given to the model, the user should explicitly ask for it, which has proven useful in improving the performance of LLMs [156]. In the context of LMMs, we have similar observations. In Figure 4, we compare the model's response to different text instructions for counting. We start with a simple and clear prompt: "Count the number of apples in the image." However, GPT-4V incorrectly counts a total of 12 apples in the image. To improve its performance, we explore the use of zero-shot chain-of-thought from [66] for LLMs by adding the phrase "Let's think step-by-step." Although GPT-4V's predicted steps are generally correct, they are not very helpful for the final count, as it still arrives at the incorrect answer of " 12 apples." Next, we modify the instruction to "Let's count the apples row-by-row," which is more relevant to the visual input. While GPT-4V provides the correct total count, it makes mistakes in counting the second/third row. When we further expand the instruction to "First count how many rows of apples there are, then count the apples in each row, and finally sum them up to get the total number," the final answer deviates even more from the correct answer ( $15 \mathrm{vs}$. 11). Finally, imitating "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer." in [156] for LLMs, we design the prompt as follows: "You are an expert in counting things in the image. Let's count the number of apples in the image below row by row to be sure we have the right answer." The first sentence in our prompt asks GPT-4V to assume the role of an expert in counting, and the second sentence explicitly instructs GPT-4V to succeed. With this design, GPT-4V successfully returns the correct answer for each row as well as the total count. Throughout the paper, we employ this technique in various scenarios for better performance.

### 3.2 Visual Pointing and Visual Referring Prompting

Pointing is a fundamental aspect of human-human interaction [89]. To provide a comparable channel of interaction, various forms of "pointing" are studied to refer to an arbitrary spatial region of interest. For example, as depicted in Figure 5, "pointing" can be represented as numerical spatial coordinates such as box coordinates and image crops, or visual markers overlaid on image pixels such as arrows, boxes, circles, and hand drawings. We observe that GPT-4V is particularly strong in understanding visual pointers drawn directly on images. Given the flexibility of drawing on images, this capability can be used as a natural approach for future human-computer interaction in the wild [90, 117, 157]. To this end, we explore a new prompting method named visual referring prompting, where people edit the pixel space of input images to specify the desired objective, such as drawing visual pointers or handwriting scene texts. As illustrated in Figure 6, visual referring prompting edits the image
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-016.jpg?height=206&width=1386&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=366)

Figure 5: Different modes of "visual pointing" in multimodal interaction.

pixels, instead of the conventional text prompts, to perform the task of interest. For example, it could be a simple grounded description, which focuses on describing the pointed object while maintaining the understanding of the global image context, as shown in Figure $6(1,2)$. Visual referring prompting also enables other novel use cases, such as associating the pointed object with an index written in scene text (Figure 6 (3)), or solving the question asked near the queried edge or angle (Figure 6 (4)). Section 5 will discuss visual referring prompting in more detail.

### 3.3 Visual + Text Prompting

Visual referring prompting can be smoothly used together with other image-text prompts, presenting a nuanced interface that succinctly represents the problem of interest. Figure 7 presents two examples to showcase the flexibility of GPT-4V's prompt, particularly its proficiency in integrating different input formats and seamlessly mixing instructions with examples in the inputs. GPT-4V's genericity and flexibility result in a human-like comprehension of multimodal instructions and an unprecedented ability to adapt to unseen tasks.

Integrated multimodal instruction inputs. Existing models usually have implicit constraints on how interleaved image-text inputs should be formatted, e.g., in-context few-shot learning requires image-text pairs to share a similar format as the query input. In contrast, GPT-4V shows the genericity in processing an arbitrary mix of images, sub-images, texts, scene texts, and visual pointers. For example, to illustrate the "adding a line" pattern in Figure 7, one could either point to the first column in the matrix image with a circle as in sub-figure (1), or incorporate the sub-images inline as in sub-figure (2). Similarly, for input query, one could either present a large figure with the question as scene texts as in sub-figure (1), or send the mix of texts and sub-images as in sub-figure (2). In contrast to GPT-4V's flexibility, existing multimodal models are highly restricted in terms of how they can combine images and texts, and the number of images they can process, thereby imposing limitations on the model's capability and genericity.

Multimodal example-grounded instruction. In addition to supporting more flexible input formats, GPT-4V's genericity also opens up more effective ways of illustrating the task to perform, compared with the instruction-following mode and in-context few-shot learning. Instruction-following techniques [102, 96, 134, 111], originally proposed for NLP tasks, intuitively focus on task instructions purely in the textual format. The text instruction is loosely related to the visual query input and thus may not provide a clear task demonstration. While in-context few-shot learning [ $23,125,7]$ provides test-time examples that contain both images and texts, these examples must align perfectly with the format of the inference query, making them complex and lengthy to incorporate. Furthermore, in-context examples are usually used separately from instructions, requiring the model to infer the task objective and thereby compromising the demonstration's effectiveness. In contrast, GPT-4V's capability to comprehend multimodal instructions enables task demonstrations to be grounded onto corresponding in-context examples, therefore more effectively illustrating the task of interest. For example, in Figure 7, grounding instructions of "finding the pattern in the first column" onto the key steps in demonstration examples (i.e., the circled pattern in (1) and corresponding sub-figures in (2)) simplifies the learning process and enhances the model's performance. This approach also mirrors the human learning process, which involves abstract instructions paired with intuitive examples.

## GPT-4V:

To find the length of the blue arrowed edge, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle. The theorem states that $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two legs of the right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. Plugging in the values we have, we get:

$4^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2} \quad 16+64=c^{2} \quad 80=c^{2} \quad \sqrt{80}=c \quad 8.94 \approx c$ Therefore, the length of the blue arrowed edge is approximately 8.94 .

To find the angle at the green arrow, we can use the tangent function since we have the opposite and adjacent sides of the angle. The tangent function states that $\tan \theta=$

opposite/adjacent. Plugging in the values we have, we get: $\tan \theta=4 / 8 \quad \tan \theta=1 / 2 \quad \theta=\tan ^{\wedge}-1(1 / 2) \quad \theta \approx 26.57^{\circ}$ Therefore, the angle at the green arrow is approximately $26.57^{\circ}$.

Figure 6: GPT-4V demonstrates the unique capability of understanding visual pointing directly overlaid on images. Based on such capability, we explore visual referring prompting that edits input image pixels (e.g., drawing visual pointers and scene texts) to prompt the task of interest. Check Section 3.2 for detailed discussions.

### 3.4 In-context Few-shot Learning

In-context few-shot learning is another intriguing emergent ability observed in LLMs [23, 39, 135, 34]. That is, LLMs can generate desired outputs without parameter updates by prepending a few in-context examples at inference time. The examples share the same format as the input query, and serve as demonstrations to illustrate the desired outputs. Similar abilities were recently observed in multimodal models [125, 7, 55, 42, 151], where query inputs are formatted image-text pairs. Complementary to instruction tuning, in-context learning "teaches" model to perform new tasks by providing in-context examples with the same format during test time. We demonstrate the in-context few-shot learning capacity of GPT-4V through a few compelling examples. We emphasize that in certain scenarios, in-context few-shot learning with a sufficient number of examples becomes essential, particularly when zero-shot or one-shot instruction approaches fall short. Figures 8-10 explore a challenging scenario involving the reading of a speed meter. In Figure 8, the zero-shot performance of GPT-4V on a screenshot of a speed meter image from a video is depicted. Despite numerous attempts to prompt GPT-4V in a zero-shot manner, it struggles to accurately read the current speed displayed in the image. The predictions it generates $(22 / 30 / 40 \mathrm{mph})$ deviate significantly from the actual human reading of "approximately $9 \mathrm{mph}$." Even when employing a 1-shot in-context example, as shown in Figure 9, using either a dissimilar example (Figure 9a) or a similar example (Figure 9b), GPT-4V still fails to accurately locate the two numbers on the left and right sides of the yellow pointer. In contrast, Figure 10 demonstrates that when provided with 2 in-context examples, one similar to the query image and the other dissimilar, GPT-4V successfully predicts the speed reading as "around 9 $\mathrm{mph}$ " by recognizing that the pointer is close to $10 \mathrm{mph}$ but not quite there yet.

The comparison between zero-shot, 1-shot, and 2-shot performance for reasoning over a complex line plot is illustrated in Figures 11-13. The example we explore here presents a great difficulty level as it involves multi-hop reasoning. To answer the question "In the graph, which year has the highest average gas price for the month of June," one needs to go through at least four steps: (i) locating the month of June on the x-axis, (ii) comparing data points for each line in June, (iii) identifying the color of the line with the highest value, and (iv) matching the color to the corresponding year in the legend at the top. Failure in any of these steps would lead to an incorrect prediction. As depicted in Figure 11, even when prompted with "text instruction, think step-by-step" in a zero-shot manner, GPT-4V fails to correctly associate the colors with the years from the legend. Furthermore, it gets distracted by the highlighted gas price of $\$ 3.32$ in the graph. Similarly, in Figure 12, although GPT-4V shows some improvement in reading the legend (correcting the corresponding colors for 2021 and 2022 compared to zero-shot), it still insists on answering with 2023 as the year with the highest average gas price for the month of June, despite the fact that the chart only includes data points until 01/17/2023. However, as we introduce another in-context example in Figure 13, GPT-4V finally arrives at the correct answer (2022) and provides intermediate steps that explain its reasoning process, similar to the demonstration shown in the in-context examples.

These proof-of-concept examples vividly demonstrate the rising significance of in-context few-shot learning for achieving improved performance with LMMs. This approach serves as a viable alternative to finetuning, analogous to the observations made in the context of LLMs [23, 39, 135, 34]. Despite the great importance of in-context few-shot learning in achieving better performance with LMMs, we limit its use in this report to prevent the potential information leakage or undesired hints from in-context examples. We also leave the quantitative evaluation of few-shot learning's gain to future studies.

## Sec. 3.4 In-context Few-shot Learning

## Zero-shot

Prompt:

What is the read of the speed meter?

GPT-4V:

The read of the speed meter is approximately 22 miles per hour ( $\mathrm{mph}$ ).

## Zero-shot (think step-by-step)

Prompt:

What is the read of the speed meter? Let's think step-by-step.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-020.jpg?height=143&width=243&top_left_y=804&top_left_x=426)

Note: Same query image as shown above, resized to save space

## GPT-4V:

There are two scales on this speedometer - one in miles per hour ( $\mathrm{mph}$ ) and one in kilometers per hour ( $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h}$ ).

The needle is pointing between the 20 and 40 on the mph scale, and between the 40 and 60 on the km/h scale. Since the numbers on the scales increase in increments of 20 , we can estimate that the needle is pointing at approximately $30 \mathrm{mph}$ and $50 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$.

Therefore, the read of the speed meter is approximately $30 \mathrm{mph}$ (or $50 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ ).

## 4 Vision-Language Capability

Understanding and describing visual information plays a crucial role in human cognition. In this section, we will investigate how GPT-4V can be utilized to comprehend and interpret the visual world. We will start by examining the model's ability to generate open-ended descriptions for generic visual captioning.

Moving forward, in Section 4.2, we will explore the application of GPT-4V in more advanced tasks, such as spatial relationship analysis, object localization, object counting, and dense captioning. In Section 4.3 , we will delve into the model's capacity for multimodal knowledge and commonsense reasoning, and study whether the model can understand the context and relationships between different types of information.

Additionally, in Section 4.4, we will assess the model's capability to extract and analyze information from various sources, including scene text, tables, charts, and documents. In Section 4.5, we will explore GPT-4V's ability in comprehending and generating descriptions in multilingual scenarios. Lastly, in Section 4.6, we will investigate the model's coding proficiency with visual information, exploring its ability to perform tasks with selected examples.

### 4.1 Image Description on Diverse Domains

We access the model's capability and generalizability by providing a single image-text pair as input. We prompt GPT-4V to generate natural language descriptions covering a variety of topics listed below.

Celebrity recognition. Recognizing human appearance [49, 80] presents a significant challenge due to its inherent variability. To assess GPT-4V's capabilities to recognize and describe the celebrities, we conduct an experiment by providing a text prompt, "Describe the image," along with an input celebrity image. In the top row of Figure 14, we observe that GPT-4V accurately identifies the eight celebrities, despite their diverse backgrounds and fields. Furthermore, when we present a more specific query, "Who is the person in the image and what is the person doing?," as shown in the bottom row of Figure 14, GPT-4V comprehends that the current President of the United States is delivering a speech at the 2023 G7 Summit. This illustrates the model's ability to generalize and handle novel scenarios, such as the 2023 G7 Summit, which was not part of its training data.

Landmark recognition. Landmarks exhibit considerable variations in appearance due to factors such as viewpoint changes, lighting conditions, occlusions, and seasonal changes. Recognizing landmarks under these variations requires models to generalize well and handle the vast range of visual appearances [152, 5]. In the experiments, we employ a straightforward text prompt, "Describe the landmark in the image," to test the model's capability. As shown in Figures 15-16, GPT-4V generates accurate and open-ended descriptions for each test image. For example, it accurately recognizes Space Needle located in Seattle, Washington, understanding that the tower was built for the 1962 World's Fair and has since become a symbol of the city. We have similar observations for other tested photos as well. The generated descriptions go beyond simple labels or generic phrases, providing vivid and detailed narratives that capture the essence of the landmark.

Food recognition. Recognizing food or dishes is a fascinating task [20, 95], but it can be challenging to tackle due to the wide range of appearances and potential occlusions caused by other objects or overlapping ingredients. In our experiments, we employ a straightforward text prompt, asking the system to "Describe the name of the dish," for testing purpose. Figure 17 demonstrates the accurate recognition of various dishes by GPT-4V. Additionally, GPT-4V effectively captures intricate details within the images, enabling it to identify specific ingredients, garnishes, or cooking techniques present in a dish.

Medical image understanding. Medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, can have large variability due to patient populations and imaging equipment. Additionally, interpreting the visual content of these images requires expert knowledge. In Figure 18, we access GPT-4V's performance by providing the prompt, "Describe the image." The results show that GPT-4V recognizes both the teeth and jaw bones in the given X-ray. Furthermore, when we prompt with "Are there wisdom teeth that needs to be removed in this x-ray image?" GPT-4V performs reasoning with the visual context, and explains that the wisdom teeth on the bottom left and right sides of the jaw are not fully emerged from the gum line, and this could be a reason for removal. We also conduct testing with other medical
images, as shown in Figure 19. For these experiments, we use prompts such as "What's wrong?" or "Look at the CT scan, tell me what's wrong." The observations reveal that GPT-4V can identify common conditions such as a Jones fracture. It could also point out potential concerns based on the CT scan of the lung. The experiments demonstrate GPT-4V's basic understanding of medical images. We discuss the application of GPT-4V to the medical domain in Section 9.3.

Logo recognition. We examine GPT-4V's ability in logo recognition. In Figure 20, we initiate the experiments by providing the text prompt, "Describe the image." GPT-4V accurately identifies the three logos depicted in the image. We then proceed to ask a more specific question, "Describe the logos in details," GPT-4V provides elaborate descriptions, including the design, style, and representation for each logo, respectively. Expanding the evaluation to a more challenging in-the-wild scenario, as shown in Figure 21, we experiment with logos that may be partially occluded, distorted, or situated in cluttered backgrounds. We employ the text prompt "Describe both the image and logo in details" for the in-the-wild experiment. As shown in Figure 21, GPT-4V demonstrates strong capability in understanding logos in difficult scenarios. Notably, GPT-4V can also provide descriptions for novel or emerging logos and icons, such as the recently released Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Scene understanding. Scene understanding $[76,32,154]$ is an important task in computer vision. We examine the model's capability by providing a simple query "Describe the image." In Figure 22, GPT-4V is able to describe the road and the location and color of the vehicles. It can also read the sign and notice the speed limit for this road.

Counterfactual examples. We conduct experiments by randomly selecting counterfactual examples from [78]. In Figure 23, we observe that GPT-4V correctly describes the image contents when faced with misleading questions or instructions.

## GPT-4V:

It is difficult to say for sure whether the wisdom teeth need to be removed from this X-ray image, as there are other factors that should be considered, such as the age of the patient and the position of the teeth. However, it appears that the wisdom teeth on the bottom left and right sides of the jaw are partially impacted, meaning they are not fully emerged from the gum line. This could be a reason for removal, as impacted wisdom teeth can cause pain, infection, and other problems.

## Prompt:

Which wisdom tooth is hardest to remove?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-032.jpg?height=217&width=336&top_left_y=1903&top_left_x=407)

Note: Same query image as shown above, resized to save space

GPT-4V:

The lower wisdom teeth, especially those that are impacted, are typically considered the hardest to remove. This is because the lower jawbone is denser than the upper jawbone, and the impacted wisdom teeth may be more difficult to access. Additionally, the roots of the lower wisdom teeth are often longer and more curved than those of the upper wisdom teeth, making them more challenging to remove.

Figure 18: Results on medical image understanding. GPT-4V recognizes both the teeth and jaw bones in the given X-ray, and explains that the partially emerged wisdom teeth on the bottom left and right sides of the jaw may necessitate removal.

### 4.2 Object Localization, Counting, and Dense Captioning

Spatial relationship understanding. Understanding the spatial relationship between humans and objects in the image is a vital aspect of visual intelligence [61, 14]. In Figure 24, GPT-4V showcases promising capabilities in this regard. It can identify the spatial relationship between the frisbee and the man in the image. It can also recognize the spatial relationship between the man and the car in the image, and point out that the camera perspective may affect their perceived size.

Object counting. Figure 25 highlights our exploration of GPT-4V's capability in object counting. In our experiments, we employ the text prompt "Count the number of X in the image" to evaluate its performance. The results indicate that GPT-4V can successfully count the number of objects, such as apples, oranges, and people, present in the image. However, challenges arise when objects are occluded, or the scene is cluttered, which can result in errors in the counting process. In the bottom left of Figure 25, GPT-4V identifies 12 people, but the correct answer should be 11 . This may be due to our limited text prompt used in this experiment, and further investigation in prompting techniques is needed.

Object localization. Object localization [153, 76, 51] is a fundamental challenge in the field of computer vision. In our preliminary experiments, we address this task by utilizing a simple text prompt, "Localize each person in the image using a bounding box." The initial results of our object localization experiments are depicted in Figure 26. The findings suggest that GPT-4V demonstrates the capability to generate bounding box coordinates in textual format, without separate textualized box tokens $[25,140,129,26,82,105]$. However, it is important to note that the generated bounding box coordinates are not accurate. We rescaled the predicted bounding box coordinates during visualization. Promising localization results are observed when the scene or background is relatively simpler and less cluttered. Further prompting techniques are required to enhance object localization performance in more complex and crowded environments.

Dense captioning. Dense captioning [62, 84] involves generating detailed description for each region of interest in the given image. This advanced task in vision-language field typically requires a complex system that integrates multiple experts, such as object detector, celebrity recognition model, and image captioning model. In order to explore GPT-4V's capabilities in dense captioning, we use an instructional prompt, as shown in Figure 27. The results are highly encouraging, as GPT-4V successfully localizes and recognizes the individuals within the image, and then provides concise descriptions for each scientist.

### 4.3 Multimodal Knowledge and Commonsense

Joke and meme. Jokes and memes often reference specific events, pop culture, or Internet trends. Understanding these references requires being familiar with the relevant context and cultural knowledge. Grasping the visual elements, their relationship to the text, and the intended humorous effect can be a complex task [99]. Moreover, memes are often user-generated, making them highly diverse and ever-expanding. To evaluate GPT-4V's ability in this domain, we input a pair of meme and text prompt to GPT-4V. The example text prompts include "Can you explain the meme?" and "What is funny about the image?" Figure 28 shows the example results. We observe that GPT-4V has remarkable ability to gather information from both visual and textual modalities, and then comprehend the humor embedded within memes.

Science and knowledge. We further investigate GPT-4V's capability in tasks that requires reasoning with scientific knowledge [85]. We conduct experiments by providing a text prompt question and a corresponding image. The questions cover a wide range of topics, including geography, physics, biology, and earth science. In Figures 29-31, we observe that GPT-4V is able to correctly answer the science questions based on the visual context. For instance, in the bottom row of Figure 29, GPT-4V recognizes the average particle speed for both sample A and sample B. By considering the relationship among particle speed, kinetic energy, and temperature, GPT-4V answers the question correctly. For another instance, as shown in the bottom row of Figure 30, GPT-4V takes into account the visual arrows presented in the figure to identify the producer in the specific food web. Moreover, as shown in Figure 31, when we provide a more specific prompt, such as "Suppose you are a teacher, please use the figure to explain $\mathrm{X}$," we observe the generated answer adopts a tutorial format and explains the subject step by step.

Multimodal commonsense. In Figure 32, we access the ability of GPT-4V in multimodal commonsense reasoning $[148,52]$. In our experiments, we observed that GPT-4V effectively utilizes the bounding boxes presented in the image as visual prompts (e.g., [person1] and [person2]) to recognize the actions performed by the individuals. As shown in the second example in Figure 32, based on the formal dress worn by [person1] and [person2] and the floral decorations present in the scene, it can be inferred that they are attending a wedding ceremony. Moreover, when we provide a more specific input prompt, such as "Suppose you are a detective, what can you infer from the visual clues?", GPT-4V demonstrates the ability to discern numerous nuanced visual cues within the image and offers a list of plausible hypotheses.

## Joke and Meme

## Prompt:

Can you explain this meme?

Me: I'll do it at 8

Time: 8.05

Me: looks like I gotta wait till 9 now

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-044.jpg?height=404&width=599&top_left_y=492&top_left_x=411)

GPT-4V:

This meme is poking fun at the idea of procrastination and how someone may put off doing a task until a certain time, but if they miss that time, they will push it back even further. In this case, the person in the meme planned to do something at 8 o'clock, but since it is now $8: 05$, they have decided to wait until 9 o'clock to do it. The image of Kermit the Frog relaxing in bed represents the person's desire to procrastinate and avoid the task.

## Prompt:

GPT-4V:

There are a couple of things that people might find funny about this image:

- It is a cartoon of a rhinoceros painting, which is an unexpected and silly concept in itself.
- The rhinoceros is painting a picture of itself, which adds an extra layer of humor.
- The caption, "You see the world as you are!", is a joke about how we all have our own unique perspectives and can be a little self-centered at times.

GPT-4V:

This meme highlights the deterioration of a person's handwriting during an exam. The first two pages show neat and legible handwriting, the middle page shows slightly messier handwriting, and the last two pages show almost illegible handwriting.

The meme is poking fun at how, as an exam progresses, a person's handwriting tends to get worse as they become more tired and rushed to finish the exam. It also implies that the person's focus and attention to detail decrease towards the end of the exam.

Prompt:

What is funny about this image?

GPT-4V:

This image is funny for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is a meme template that has been widely used and recognized on the internet. The left side of the image is a screenshot from the reality TV show "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" where one of the cast members is angrily pointing and yelling. The right side of the image is a picture of a cat sitting at a dinner table with a plate of food in front of it, looking unimpressed. The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two sides - the angry, dramatic yelling on the left and the nonchalant cat on the right. It also plays on the idea of cats acting like humans and being unimpressed by our behavior. Overall, the image creates a funny and absurd situation that makes people laugh.

GPT-4V:

The prime meridian intersects the following oceans:

- Atlantic Ocean
- Southern Ocean
- Arctic Ocean


## Prompt:

Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. Which sample has the higher temperature? Sample A or sample B?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-045.jpg?height=437&width=331&top_left_y=1538&top_left_x=409)

Sample A

Mass of each particle: $32 \mathrm{u}$

Average particle speed: $600 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-045.jpg?height=442&width=312&top_left_y=1541&top_left_x=901)

Sample B

Mass of each particle: $32 \mathrm{u}$

Average particle speed: $540 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

GPT-4V:

Because the average particle speed in sample $A$ is higher than in sample $B$ ( $600 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \mathrm{vs} .540 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})$, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, sample $A$ has a higher temperature than sample $B$.

Prompt:

Suppose you are a teacher, please use the figure to explain the distinction between evaporation and evapotranspiration.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-047.jpg?height=688&width=1135&top_left_y=800&top_left_x=403)

GPT-4V:

Okay class, today we are going to learn about the distinction between evaporation and evapotranspiration. Let's take a look at this figure.

First, let's understand what evaporation is. Evaporation is the process by which water is changed from its liquid state to its gaseous state. This usually takes place at the surface of a liquid, like the ocean or a lake, when the water molecules gain enough energy to break away and form water vapor. So in this figure, we can see that the water in the lake and the dam is evaporating and becoming water vapor.

Now, let's take a look at evapotranspiration. This is a combination of two processes - evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor through their leaves. So, in this figure, we can see that the trees and plants are releasing water vapor into the air, which is the transpiration part of evapotranspiration. At the same time, the water in the soil and the surface is also evaporating. This combination of evaporation and transpiration is what we call evapotranspiration.

In summary, evaporation is the process by which water is changed from its liquid state to its gaseous state, while evapotranspiration is the combination of evaporation and transpiration. Both these processes contribute to the water cycle and are important for maintaining the balance of water in our environment.

### 4.4 Scene Text, Table, Chart, and Document Reasoning

Scene text recognition. Reading and understanding scene text in images is an important task in vision-language [118-120, 17]. In our experiments, we investigate GPT-4V's ability to recognize scene text by utilizing the input prompt "What are all the scene text in the image?" Figure 33 shows the example results. We observe GPT-4V accurately identifies scene text in various scenarios, including both handwritten and printed text. In Section 4.5, we present further results on multilingual scenarios.

Visual math reasoning. In Figure 34, GPT-4V demonstrates its capability in solving visual math problems. In our experiments, we observe GPT-4V is able to extract essential information from the image. For instance, in Figure 34, GPT-4V correctly identifies the presence of a right triangle (or orthogonal triangle) and determines that $\mathrm{AB}$ is 4 units and $\mathrm{BC}$ is 3 units. In addition, we note that GPT-4V tends to present solutions in a well-structured manner, solving the problem step by step, thereby showcasing its ability to provide clear explanations.

Chart understanding and reasoning. We further study GPT-4V's ability in chart understanding and reasoning. Figures 35-37 show the example results. In our preliminary explorations, GPT-4V exhibits the ability to provide detailed descriptions of charts. For example, in Figure 35, the model correctly explains the proposal process from the beginning to the end. In Figure 36, the model not only understands the program in the given flow chat, but also translates the details to a python code. In the bottom row of Figure 37, GPT-4V shows a clear understanding of both x- and y-axis, and explains the key insight presented in the chart. Furthermore, in our experiments, we observe that GPT-4V can answer questions based on the chart. In the top row of Figure 37, GPT-4V correctly calculates the average total fueling cost, excluding the Ford F150.

Table understanding and reasoning. In Figure 38, we present our preliminary investigations into table understanding and reasoning. Similar to the findings from chart experiments, GPT-4V shows promising results in understanding the details in the table, as well as in reasoning and accurately responding to related questions.

Document understanding. Figure 39 shows the results on various types of documents, such as floor plan, poster, and exam paper. We observe GPT-4V demonstrates an understanding of the documents and provides reasonable responses. For instance, it accurately identifies the location of the bathroom for the second bedroom in the floor plan. It also recognizes the Chinese dish "Hot dry noodles," and associates it with the city of Wuhan by following the scene text. Moreover, GPT-4V is capable of reading an exam paper. It accurately reconstructs the table in Markdown, and then fills in the table with the correct answers. We present more explorations in its coding ability in Section 4.6.

In Figure 40, we explore a more challenging case by providing a technical report [126] with multiple pages as input. In our limited exploration, GPT-4V exhibits impressive results. It correctly describes the main idea and their proposed method by considering the context across multiple pages. However, it may occasionally miss some implementation details. Please note that the dataset should contain $1196+665=1861$ examples, and the extracted features should include Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Instead of prompting all pages to the model simultaneously, we believe that exploring more advanced prompting techniques, such as thinking step-by-step or employing in-context few-shot approaches, could potentially enhance the model's performance.

## Sec. 4.4 Scene Text, Table, Chart, and Document Reasoning

## Visual Math

Prompt:

What is $x$ in the equation?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-051.jpg?height=130&width=372&top_left_y=645&top_left_x=405)

GPT-4V:

Without any context or information about what the equation is representing, we can only assume that " $x$ " is a variable or unknown value in the equation.

In this equation, $(x+3)$ is being squared and is equal to 4. To solve for $x$, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation to get rid of the exponent on the left side. This would give us:

$\sqrt{ }\left((x+3)^{2}\right)=\sqrt{ } 4$

$x+3= \pm 2$

From here, we can solve for $x$ by subtracting 3 from both sides. This would give us:

$x=-1$ or $x=-5$

So, in this equation, $x$ could be either -1 or -5

## Prompt:

What is the value of $d$ in the last equation?

## Solve the following equations

1) $8 x+11=4 x+14$
2) $7 d-4=11 d-9$

## GPT-4V:

1) To solve the first equation, we need to isolate the $x$ variable on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. We can start by subtracting $4 x$ from both sides to get rid of the $x$ term on the right side of the equation. This gives us:

$4 x+11=14$

Next, we can subtract 11 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. This gives us:

$4 x=3$

Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate the $x$ variable on the left side of the equation. This gives us:

$$
x=3 / 4
$$

2) To solve the second equation, we can start by subtracting 7d from both sides to get rid of the $d$ term on the left side of the equation. This gives us:

$-4=4 d-9$

Next, we can add 9 to both sides to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation. This gives us:

$$
5=4 d
$$

Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to isolate the $d$ variable on the right side of the equation. This gives us:

$$
d=5 / 4
$$

So, the value of $d$ in the last equation is $5 / 4$.

## Prompt:

What is the value of $x$ in the image?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-051.jpg?height=208&width=311&top_left_y=644&top_left_x=1300)

GPT-4V:

The value of $x$ in the image can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, the hypotenuse is the side $A C$, and the other two sides are $A B$ and $B C$. We know that $A B$ is 4 and $B C$ is 3 , so we can plug these values into the equation:

$a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$

$3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}$

$9+16=c^{2}$

$25=c^{2}$

GPT-4V:

This figure represents a flow chart of a team's proposal process. The process begins with a team member suggesting a project in a meeting. The team then discusses whether it is a good idea or not. If the idea is not considered a good one, the team rejects it and the process ends.

If the team thinks it might be a good idea but needs more information, a team member conducts further research and refines the idea into a proposal. The team then reviews the proposal and provides feedback. If the proposal is not okay, then the team member revises it and the team reviews it again.

If the proposal is okay, the team sends it to a final decision-making process. If the proposal is approved, then the team proceeds with the project. This is the end of the proposal process.

Sure, here's the Python code:

num1 = input("Enter first number: ") num2 = input("Enter second number: ") if num1 > num2: print(num1) else: print(num2)

Explanation:

- The first two lines correspond to the "Input num1" and "Input num2" blocks in the flowchart, where the user is prompted to enter two numbers.
- The next two lines correspond to the "num1 > num2?" block, where a conditional statement is used to check if the first number is greater than the second number.
- If the condition is true, the next line ("Display num1") is executed, and the first number is printed to the screen. - If the condition is false, the else statement is executed, and the second number is printed to the screen (“Display num2").
- The code then stops, corresponding to the "Stop" block in the flowchart.

## GPT-4V:

The figure is a graph that shows the relationship between the quality of a paper and its impact on a person's career. The $x$-axis represents the quality of the paper, which ranges from bad to creative and original. The $y$-axis represents the impact the paper has on a person's career, which ranges from nothing to lots of impact.

The graph shows that a bad paper has little to no impact on a person's career, while a creative and original paper has a significant impact. The impact of the paper on a person's career increases as the quality of the paper improves. This suggests that the quality of a person's work is an important factor in determining their success in their career.

## GPT-4V:

The paper "Paper Gestalt" is a research paper written by Carven von Bearnensquash from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Phoenix. The paper discusses the visual quality of a computer science research paper and how it affects the overall impression of the paper.

The paper begins with an introduction to the concept of paper gestalt, which is the overall impression of a paper. The author argues that the visual quality of a paper is an important factor in creating a good impression. The paper then discusses previous work in this area and highlights the contribution of this paper, which is the use of a supervised learning algorithm to evaluate the visual quality of a paper.

The paper then presents the methodology and experimental results. The author collected a dataset of 1196 computer science research papers and used a supervised learning algorithm to evaluate the visual quality of the papers. The algorithm was trained on a set of features extracted from the papers, such as the number of figures, the number of equations, and the number of references. The results showed that the algorithm was able to accurately predict the visual quality of a paper with a high degree of accuracy.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and future work. The author suggests that future work could focus on improving the algorithm by incorporating more features and training it on a larger dataset. The paper also suggests that the algorithm could be used to evaluate the visual quality of other types of documents, such as technical reports and dissertations.

Overall, the contribution of this paper is the use of a supervised learning algorithm to evaluate the visual quality of a computer science research paper. This is a novel approach that could help researchers improve the visual quality of their papers and make a better impression on their readers.

### 4.5 Multilingual Multimodal Understanding

We assess GPT-4V's ability in comprehending multiple languages and modalities. First, we explore this capability by evaluating natural images without scene text, as depicted in Figure 41. In the first row of the figure, we provide the input text prompt "Describe the image" in Chinese, French, and Czech, respectively. GPT-4V recognizes the input text prompts in different languages, and generates correct image descriptions in corresponding languages. In the second row of Figure 41, we provide the input text prompt in English and specify the output language. GPT-4V follows the instruction and generates correct descriptions in the desired languages. In the bottom row of Figure 41, we provide an input prompt in Spanish, and ask GPT-4V to generate image descriptions in 20 different languages. We observe that GPT-4V can process both the input and output text in different languages.

Furthermore, we explore a scenario involving multilingual scene text recognition, where the input image may contain scene text in various languages. As shown in Figure 42, GPT-4V correctly identifies and understands the scene text from different scenes. As shown in the first two rows of Figure 43, we observe that GPT-4V can recognize the scene text, and translate it to a different language. In the bottom row of Figure 43, we provide a screenshot of a Wikipedia website which is in Catalan, and instruct GPT-4V to summarize the information in 20 different languages. GPT-4V not only recognizes the text in Catalan but also generates precise summaries and translates them into different languages. This showcases GPT-4V's ability to comprehend and translate multilingual scene text.

We also explore the capability of multicultural understanding [147, 77]. Figure 44 shows the example results in such a scenario. We observe that GPT-4V is capable of understanding cultural nuances and generating reasonable multilingual descriptions for the wedding images given.

In our exploration, we found that GPT-4V seamlessly comprehends and correctly generates descriptions in different languages, highlighting its versatility in handling diverse linguistic contexts.

## 5 Interaction with Humans: Visual Referring Prompting

Pointing to a specific spatial location is an essential capability in human-computer interaction with multimodal systems, such as conducting visually grounded dialogues. As shown in Section 5.1, GPT-4V can well understand the visual pointers directly drawn on images. Based on this observation, we propose a novel model interaction method named "visual referring prompting." The core idea is to directly edit image pixel space to draw visual pointers or scene texts as human referring instructions, as highlighted in Figure 50. We detail its usages and advantages in Section 5.2. Finally, Section 5.3 explores having GPT-4V generate visual pointer outputs to interact with humans. These visual pointers are intuitive for both humans and machines to generate and understand, making them a good channel for human-computer interaction.

### 5.1 Understand Pointing Inputs

As illustrated in Figure 48, GPT-4V can understand different types of visual markers directly overlaid on images as a pointer, such as circles, boxes, and hand drawings. This ability helps GPT-4V generate grounded captioning, which is a known challenging problem to have conventional vision-language models [128] generating visual descriptions focused on a specific area of interest. Dense captioning methods $[62,138]$ use cropped boxes or mask regions to generate localized descriptions, but often ignore the global image context and produce sub-optimal descriptions. Visual pointing provides a natural way to indicate the area of interest while maintaining the global image context. For example, the top left example focuses on providing a comprehensive description of the pointed Magna beer, while also mentioning the global image context that the beer bottle is on the table.

An intuitive alternative to visual pointers overlaid on images is the region coordinates represented in the numerical text format. As shown in Figure 49, GPT-4V can understand the coordinates out-of-box, achieving the ability of spatial referring via text tokens without extra box token finetuning as in prior vision-language models [129, 143]. Despite the promising capability, we note that our current prompt is less precise spatially. For example, in the top left example in Figure 49, GPT-4V mentions the surrounding objects napkin and water bottle, even though only the beer bottle is in the region ( 0.47 , $0.48,0.55,0.87$ ). Overall, with respect to our experimented prompts, GPT-4V works more reliably when prompted with overlaid visual pointers, compared with text coordinates. This unique capability motivates us to explore a new prompting method, namely visual referring prompting.

GPT-4V:

The region $(0.47,0.48,0.55,0.87)$ is located towards the right side of the image, slightly below the center. It covers a small portion of the table and the background. In this region, there is a green bottle of Magna beer on the table, with a white napkin next to it. In the background, there is a part of an umbrella and a few chairs.

Figure 49: An alternative to visual pointers overlaid on images is the region coordinates represented in the numerical text format. GPT-4V can understand the coordinates, e.g., ( $0.47,0.48,0.55,0.87)$, $(0.01,0.09,0.29,0.21)$, and $(0.01,0.67,0.36,0.91)$ that correspond to the center beer bottle, top-left string lights, and bottom-left table set, respectively. We observe that GPT-4V works less reliably when prompted with text coordinates, compared with visual pointers in visual referring prompting. Check Section 5.1 for detailed discussions.

### 5.2 Visual Referring Prompting

Inspired by GPT-4V's strong capability in understanding visual pointing and scene text, we explore a new method to interact with GPT-4V, namely the visual referring prompting. Instead of conventional prompting techniques that edit text space, visual referring prompting is a complementary technique that directly edits the pixel space for input images for human-computer interaction. Such visual prompting could offer a more nuanced and comprehensive interaction with the image, potentially unlocking a wider array of responses from the model. For example, in Figure 50 (1), GPT-4V naturally associates the arrow-pointed objects with the given object indexes, easing the remaining visual reasoning and text outputs; in (2), GPT-4V understands the questions written on the image and pointed to the corresponding edge or angle, providing a nuanced interface for grounded visual dialogue; in (3), humans can point to arbitrary regions inside the figure to help GPT-4V better understand complicated documents and charts; in (4), the pattern can be concisely represented as an arrow and the scene text "+dot", therefore helping GPT-4V to predict the next image. Complementary to text prompts that are loosely grounded to images, visual referring prompting provides a novel interaction method that could facilitate various use cases, with additional demonstrations in Figure 51 and Section 9 .

### 5.3 Generate Pointing Outputs

Section 5.1 discusses the ability of GPT-4V to understand visual pointing generated by humans. A natural question is: Can GPT-4V generate its own pointing outputs, thereby facilitating a closed-loop interaction process in human-computer interaction?

Figure 52 explores generating visual pointing outputs by letting GPT-4V predict region coordinates in the text format. We prompt GPT-4V to ground the object referred by text (e.g., the text of "blue Subaru SUV") or a reference image (e.g., the image of "black Audi sedan"). Similar to the observation in having GPT-4V comprehend coordinates input, the model has a coarse understanding of spatial locations, but it wasn't accurate with respect to the prompts used in the experiment. For example, in Figure 52's "plot visualizations," GPT-4V can approximately identify the blue SUV and black sedan mentioned in the query, but it struggles to create a closely-fitted bounding box. We observe that including example-grounded instructions in the prompt helps GPT-4V to understand the definition of coordinates and subsequently generate better pointing outputs.

While the generated pointing outputs may not perfectly cover the queried region, they still provide a valuable tool for model interaction, interpretation, and helping multi-step visual reasoning. Specifically, the pointing outputs can be interpreted by humans to better understand GPT-4V's references, or by GPT-4V itself to enable further reasoning based on previous outputs. As shown in the bottom of Figure 52, GPT-4V is capable of interpreting the pointers it generates, and providing grounded descriptions with the prompts in Figure 48. Furthermore, the iterative pointing generation and understanding by GPT-4V itself can help complicated multi-hop grounded visual reasoning tasks. GPT-4V is capable of deconstructing the question, generating distinct visual markers to iteratively focus on different image regions for each sub-step, ultimately collating the information to formulate the final answer.

GPT-4V:

To find the length of the blue arrowed edge, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle. The theorem states that $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two legs of the right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. Plugging in the values we have, we get: $4^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2} \quad 16+64=c^{2} \quad 80=c^{2} \quad \sqrt{80}=c \quad 8.94 \approx c$ Therefore, the length of the blue arrowed edge is approximately 8.94 .

To find the angle at the green arrow, we can use the tangent function since we have the opposite and adjacent sides of the angle. The tangent function states that $\tan \theta=$ opposite/adjacent. Plugging in the values we have, we get: $\tan \theta=4 / 8 \quad \tan \theta=1 / 2 \quad \theta=\tan ^{\wedge}-1(1 / 2) \quad \theta \approx 26.57^{\circ}$ Therefore, the angle at the green arrow is approximately $26.57^{\circ}$.

GPT-4V:

The next image in the sequence would be a star with a dot in the center. This is because the sequence appears to be following a pattern where the shape alternates between a diamond and a star, and a dot is added to the center of the shape every other image. Intermediate steps:

- First, we can observe that the sequence alternates between a diamond and a star shape.
- Next, we can see that a dot is added to the center of the shape every other image.
- Based on this pattern, we can predict that the next image will be a star with a dot in the center.

GPT-4V:

There are a few key differences between the two experiments shown in the slides:

1. The tasks: The first experiment (on the left) is focused on the task of visual grounding, where the model is trained to identify and localize objects in an image. The second experiment (on the right) is focused on the task of image captioning, where the model is trained to generate a descriptive caption for an image. 2. The datasets: The first experiment uses the Flickr30k Entities dataset, which contains images with annotated object bounding boxes. The second experiment uses the MSCOCO and VQA2 datasets, which contain images with associated captions.
2. The evaluation metrics: The first experiment uses the mean Average Precision metric to evaluate the model's performance on the visual grounding task. The second experiment uses the BLEU and CIDEr metrics to evaluate the model's performance on the image captioning task.

Overall, the two experiments are designed to evaluate the UniTAB model's performance on different tasks and datasets, and to demonstrate its ability to handle multiple tasks with a single model.

## 6 Temporal and Video Understanding

In this section, we discuss temporal and video understanding capabilities. Even though GPT$4 \mathrm{~V}$ operates primarily on images as inputs, evaluating its understanding of temporal sequences and video content remains a crucial aspect of its overall assessment. This is because real-world events unfold over time, and an AI system's ability to understand these dynamic processes is instrumental in real-world applications. Capabilities like temporal anticipation, temporal ordering, temporal localization, temporal reasoning, and grounded temporal understanding help to gauge the model's proficiency in comprehending the sequence of events, anticipating future occurrences, and contextually analyzing activities over time, all within a series of static images. In spite of its image-centric focus, GPT-4V is able to comprehend video and temporal sequences in a way that's similar to human comprehension. To enhance the versatility and applicability of a sophisticated AI model like GPT-4V, this aspect of testing is critical to its development and refinement. For the upcoming experiments in this section, we will use multiple selected video frames as inputs to test the model's abilities in understanding temporal sequences and video content.

### 6.1 Multi-image Sequencing

In this subsection, we demonstrate that GPT-4V can accurately comprehend and analyze sequences of video frames. Within this frame-by-frame analysis, GPT-4V recognizes the scene in which the activity is taking place, delivering a deeper contextual understanding. As shown in Figure 53, the model is not just confined to recognizing the environment; it also accurately interprets the actions being performed by individuals in the video. GPT-4V understands the sequence and context of various human poses and intelligently correlates them with the ongoing activity. By understanding pose variations beyond just identification, GPT-4V can derive meaning from the subtleties of human movement and action. As a result of this level of detailed understanding, GPT-4V can capture the essence of what's happening in videos, offering rich and nuanced insights that go beyond just identifying objects and scenes.

### 6.2 Video Understanding

Temporal ordering. Temporal ordering is a crucial element of temporal commonsense and forms an essential part of GPT-4V's capabilities evaluation. This involves providing the model with a series of shuffled images and gauging its ability to discern cause and effect relationships as well as time progressions. An understanding of such relationships requires the ability to reorder the sequence in a logically coherent and temporally accurate manner. Figure 54 illustrates an example of long-term temporal ordering where GPT-4V is presented with a series of shuffled image frames depicting a sushi-making event. Despite the disorder, GPT-4V effectively identifies the event and determines the appropriate temporal sequence of the sushi-making process. In addition, Figure 55 provides an example of short-term temporal ordering. Given a designated action, such as opening or closing a door, GPT- $4 \mathrm{~V}$ demonstrates its capability to comprehend the image's content and determine the correct sequential order of the events. These examples highlight GPT-4V's capability in temporal commonsense, reinforcing its ability to comprehend both long-term and short-term sequences accurately.

Temporal anticipation. We demonstrate GPT-4V's ability to anticipate future events given a set of initial frames. Long- and short-term examples are used to validate this capacity for anticipating future events. The right side of Figure 56 illustrates GPT-4V's ability to anticipate short-term events with a soccer penalty kick example. Given the first few frames, it accurately foresees the typical next actions of both the kicker and the goalkeeper, due to its understanding of the inherent structure and rules of the game. In addition, as shown in The left side of Figure 56, the sushi preparation sequence illustrates GPT-4V's long-term anticipation capability. By understanding the activity based on visual cues, GPT-4V not only recognizes the current progress in sushi preparation but also accurately anticipates the subsequent steps, demonstrating its capacity to interpret and predict complex, multi-step processes over an extended period. This combination of short-term and long-term temporal anticipation allows GPT-4V to capture and understand activities with varying temporal structures and complexities.

Temporal localization and reasoning. Figure 57 illustrates GPT-4V's capabilities in temporal localization and reasoning. It accurately identifies the precise moment the player strikes the ball. Fur-

thermore, GPT-4V showcases its understanding of cause and effect by inferring from the relationship between the goalkeeper and the ball to determine if the goalkeeper successfully blocks the ball. In the context of the example given, understanding whether the goalkeeper can block the ball involves not only recognizing the spatial positions of the goalkeeper and the ball but also understanding the dynamics of their interaction and predicting the outcome of these dynamics. This demonstrates a considerable level of sophistication in the model's reasoning abilities.

GPT-4V:

The player kicks the ball at frame c. The ball was not blocked by the goalkeeper as it can be seen in frame $f$ that the ball is in the net and the goalkeeper is on the ground.

Figure 57: Temporal localization and reasoning: GPT-4V shows the capability in temporal localization by accurately identifying when the player strikes the ball. It also demonstrates cause-and-effect reasoning by determining whether the ball was blocked based on the goalkeeper-ball interaction. Check Section 6.2 for detailed discussions.

### 6.3 Visual Referring Prompting for Grounded Temporal Understanding

Section 5 illustrates GPT-4V's capabilities in visual referring prompting. In this section, we aim to extend this capability by testing visual referring prompting for temporal understanding. This advancement offers enhanced control over video comprehension tasks.

Grounded temporal understanding. Grounded temporal understanding forms another crucial aspect of GPT-4V's capabilities, which we explore using pointing input in a sequence of image frames. Figure 58 exemplifies this by demonstrating how GPT-4V can apply a temporal understanding to a specific person of interest, indicated by a circle. GPT-4V can accurately describe events in a way that aligns with the corresponding temporal order, focusing on the activities of the circled individual. Beyond this, GPT-4V demonstrates a more refined understanding of the event, recognizing the nature of the interactions. For instance, GPT-4V can distinguish between friendly interactions and violent incidents, illustrating an ability to not only comprehend the temporal flow of events but also to interpret the tone and nature of the interactions taking place. This indicates GPT-4V's capacity to process and comprehend complex temporal and social cues within a given sequence, adding a layer of depth to its understanding.

## 7 Abstract Visual Reasoning and Intelligence Quotient Test

Understanding and reasoning over abstract visual stimuli and symbols is one fundamental ability for human intelligence. This section examines if GPT-4V can abstract semantics from visual signals and can perform different types of human Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests.

### 7.1 Abstract Visual Stimuli

Humans can infer semantics from abstract and often ambiguous visual stimuli. Figure 59 explores having GPT-4V interpret tangram [31, 97, 43, 59]. A tangram is a traditional geometric puzzle that consists of seven flat pieces called tans, which are put together to form shapes without overlapping the pieces. For example, GPT-4V interprets that sub-figure 7 in Figure 59 best illustrates a flying goose and provides reasoning descriptions for other sub-figure, e.g., 4. person or robot, 9. boat or hat, and 10. dog or fox. GPT-4V also has the ability to understand other formats of abstract visual diagrams [127, 16, 150], such as ASCII text art of cartoon characters in Figure 59 and symbolic inputs in Figures 61-62.

### 7.2 Discovery and Association of Parts and Objects

Discovering and associating object parts [139, 44] is another important abstract visual reasoning capability. Humans can easily discover how object parts may compose a semantically meaningful object. Figure 60 designs examples to probe GPT-4V's capability in associating object parts. In the left example, we ask GPT-4V to localize an object part based on its semantic meaning. In the right example, GPT-4V is asked to associate object parts segmented by SAM [65]. GPT-4V can process figures for all object parts and associate them in a semantically meaningful to form the boy visualized in the bottom right.

### 7.3 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale

Section 7.1 demonstrates the abstract visual understanding capability of GPT-4V. As a further challenge, GPT-4V is asked to perform different abstract reasoning tasks, sourced from human Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [133] is recognized as one of the "gold standard IQ tests," and is designed to provide a comprehensive measurement of an individual's cognitive abilities using a series of sub-tests. Figure 61 shows representative questions and GPT-4V's outputs from each sub-test category. GPT-4V shows promises in abstract reasoning, answering questions with texts only, symbolic visual inputs, and natural images. For example, the bottom right sample shows that GPT-4V can interpret the analogy question and find the best comparison of shoes.

### 7.4 Raven's Progressive Matrices

Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) [109] is another well-known non-verbal intelligence test developed to measure abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities. The test is designed to minimize the influence of language, culture, and formal education on test performance, making it suitable for testing AI models [16, 150, 55]. Each test sample contains three or eight images, arranged in 2-by-2 or 3-by-3 matrices with one figure missing. The goal is to select the next image from multiple candidate images by identifying patterns in the provided samples. In our approach, we challenge GPT-4V by sending the entire question page as a single image, instead of converting it into interleaved image-text pairs, similar to the human approach to IQ tests. As shown in Figure 62, GPT-4V can generate reasonable answers without processed text descriptions or sub-figures. However, we also notice that breaking down the entire question image into interleaved text and sub-figures, such as in Figure 63, does simplify the task and let GPT-4V produce more reliable answers.

## Sec. 7.2 Association of Parts and Objects

## Discovery and Association of Parts and Objects

Prompt:

A tangram is a geometric puzzle that consists of seven flat pieces to form shapes. Locate the referred object and represent the location of the region. Regions are represented by ( $\mathrm{x} 1, \mathrm{y} 1, \mathrm{x} 2, \mathrm{y} 2$ ) coordinates. $\mathrm{x} 1 \mathrm{x} 2$ are the left and right most positions, normalized into 0 to 1 , where 0 is the left and 1 is the right. y1 y2 are the top and bottom most positions, normalized into 0 to 1 , where 0 is the top and 1 is the bottom. For example, the ( $\mathrm{x} 1, \mathrm{y} 1, \mathrm{x} 2, \mathrm{y} 2$ ) coordinates for that region with the beer bottle is $(0.47,0.48,0.55,0.87)$.

GPT-4V:

The head of the bird is represented by the small triangle at the top of the image. The $(x 1, y 1, x 2, y 2)$ coordinates for the region with the head of the bird would be approximately $(0.42,0.15,0.58,0.35)$.

## Grounded VQA

Prompt:

What is the highlighted part?

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-082.jpg?height=412&width=428&top_left_y=1943&top_left_x=404)

GPT-4V:

The highlighted part is the head of the goose.

## Prompt:

How are those visual parts related, and can they be combined to form a single object such as a boy? If so how to arrange them?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-082.jpg?height=1080&width=358&top_left_y=388&top_left_x=1116)

GPT-4V:

The three visual parts are related in that they are all components that could be used to create a single object. In this case, the object is a boy. To combine these parts to form a boy, we can arrange them in the following way:

- The first image (the cardboard with orange and green shapes) could be used as the body of the boy. - The second image (the pair of jeans) could be used as the legs of the boy.
- The third image (the cardboard with yellow, red, and blue shapes) could be used as the head of the boy. By arranging these parts in this way, we can create a single object that resembles a boy.

GPT-4V:

Answer: d. is the least like the other four because it is the only one that does not have a central point connecting all the other points.

## Prompt:

Tom, twelve years old, is three times as old as his sister. How old will Tom be when he is twice as old as his sister?

a. 18

b. 21

c. 16

d. 20

e. 15

## GPT-4V:

If Tom is three times as old as his sister, then his sister is one-third of his age. So, his sister is 4 years old. Now, we need to figure out when Tom will be twice as old as his sister. This means that his sister's age will be half of his age. So, we need to find a number that is double the age of 4 . The answer is 8 . So, Tom will be 16 years old when he is twice as old as his sister. The correct answer is c. 16.

Aesthetics reflects the perceived beauty or visual appeal of an object, design, or piece of art by human Among the images provided below, based on societal standards and norms, which one more people will consider having a higher aesthetics?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-088.jpg?height=890&width=588&top_left_y=806&top_left_x=411)

GPT-4V:

Based on societal standards and norms, more people will likely consider the second image (the colorful houses) as having a higher aesthetics. This is because the image is more visually appealing and has a more artistic and creative feel to it. The first image (the house) is more plain and ordinary, and while it may be considered aesthetically pleasing to some, it is not as striking or eye-catching as the second image.

## Prompt:

Aesthetics reflects the perceived beauty or visual appeal of an object, design, or piece of art by human. Among the images provided below, based on societal standards and norms, which one more people will consider having a higher aesthetics?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-088.jpg?height=880&width=588&top_left_y=810&top_left_x=1083)

GPT-4V:

Most people would likely consider the first image to have a higher aesthetic value. This is because the image is more visually appealing, with a variety of colors, buildings, and greenery. The second image is less visually appealing, with a more monochromatic color scheme and less variety in the buildings and landscape. Additionally, the first image is of a more iconic and recognizable location (New York City), which may also contribute to its perceived aesthetic value.

Figure 66: GPT-4V judges image aesthetics based on societal standards and norms. Check Section 8.2 for detailed discussions.

In addition to interpreting visual sentiment, GPT-4V also aligns with human subjective judgments such as aesthetics. Figure 66 shows examples of GPT-4V judging image aesthetics based on societal standards.

### 8.3 Emotion Conditioned Output

Based on the perceived emotions, GPT-4V effectively generates proper text outputs conditioned on the desired emotion. For example, in Figure 67, GPT-4V can follow the prompt to describe the right-side scary image in a way that makes it more horrifying or becoming comforting. This demonstrates GPT-4V's potential to enable emotion-aware human-robot communication.

## 9 Emerging Application Highlights

In this section, we showcase a myriad of high-value application scenarios and new use cases that can be potentially enabled by the remarkable capabilities of GPT-4V. While it is true that some of these application scenarios can be accomplished by meticulously curating the training data for finetuning existing Vision and Language (VL) models, we want to emphasize that the true power of GPT-4V lies in its ability to perform effortlessly right out of the box. Moreover, we present how GPT-4V seamlessly integrates with external tools and plugins, further expanding its potential and enabling even more innovative and collaborative applications.

### 9.1 Spot the Difference

We begin with a generic use case inspired by the brain-teasing game "Spot the Difference." In Figures 68-69, we provide GPT-4V two visually similar images that contain subtle differences in certain regions. The task given to GPT-4V is to identify all the differences between the two images. Among the four examples, GPT-4V successfully identifies the regions or components that differ in the images. However, it falls short in providing accurate explanations for what is depicted in each image. To delve deeper into GPT-4V's capabilities, let's focus on the first example shown in Figure 68. Although GPT-4V fails to recognize that the discrepancy lies in the number of cuts in the hairband rather than the shade of the hair, it correctly identifies that the crown, the bow of the dress, and the hair differ between the two images. While GPT-4V's predictions in the "Spot the Difference" game are not perfect, its ability to compare the content in two images proves valuable in real-life applications, such as defect detection, which we will explore in the following subsections.

### 9.2 Industry

Defect detection. Throughout the history of manufacturing, computer vision techniques have played a crucial role. One specific application scenario is defect detection, which is an essential step in manufacturing processes to ensure product quality. Detecting faults or defects in a timely manner and taking appropriate actions are vital for minimizing operational and quality-related costs.

In this scenario, we demonstrate the defect detection capabilities of GPT-4V by presenting images of defective products in Figures 70-71. For commonly encountered products in real-life (e.g., hazelnut, fabric, screw, and car bumper in Figure 70), GPT-4V confidently identifies the defects such as small holes in the hazelnut/fabric, stripped heads of screws, and dents in car bumpers. However, when it comes to uncommon product images (e.g., the metal parts in Figures 70-71) or products with variations in appearance (e.g., the pill in Figure 71), GPT-4V may hesitate or even refuse to make predictions. An interesting case in Figure 71 involves a car tire, where multiple defects can be observed in the image, including dirt on the wheel, damage to the outer edge of the rim, and signs of wear on the tire. GPT-4V only focuses on the minor defect (dirt on the wheel) and fails to mention the major defect (damage to the outer edge of the rim) that would require repair.

Given the success of GPT-4V in "Spot the Difference" scenario shown in Section 9.1, we explore the idea of incorporating a reference image to illustrate what a defect-free product should look like, with the aim of improving the failure cases depicted in Figure 71. The results of this approach are presented in Figure 72. By including the reference image and refining the prompt, GPT-4V successfully identifies defects in all three failure cases in single-image defect detection. These promising findings highlight a potential high-value application of GPT-4V for defect detection in the manufacturing industry.

Safety inspection. Figure 73 presents an exploration of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) counting for safety inspection. The inadequate usage or failure to wear PPE, such as helmets, harnesses, and gloves, in work environments like construction sites, significantly increases the risk level associated with work activities. To effectively address this issue, computer vision techniques have been employed as a solution to monitor PPE compliance and promptly identify any violations of safety regulations. Taking helmets as an example, a safety inspection system is necessary to accurately detect and report the number of employees who are not wearing helmets.

In Figure 73a, we assess the performance of GPT-4V by directly instructing it to count the individuals wearing helmets. GPT-4V provides a response of " 8 persons wearing helmets," which matches the
total count of people shown in the image, suggesting there is no alerting safety violations. Obviously, GPT-4V fails to detect the 3 individuals who are not wearing helmets, thus compromising their personal safety. This task poses a considerable challenge for GPT-4V, as it involves detecting people in the image, determining whether they are wearing helmets, and calculating the final count of people who are not wearing the helmets.

In Figure 73b, instead of presenting GPT-4V with the original image containing all 8 individuals, we provide cropped regions of the detected persons with an external person detector. This approach divides the PPE counting workload into two steps: relying on an off-the-shelf person detector for person detection and leveraging GPT-4V's robust visual reasoning capabilities and its ability to handle interleaved image-text inputs for identifying the safety issues. As we can see, GPT-4V can correctly count the person who is not wearing the helmet, also demonstrating the benefit of tool use and divide-and-conquer.

Grocery checkout. Self-checkout machines have become increasingly popular in major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS to expedite the checkout process for customers and reduce the workload for employees. However, the actual experience with self-checkout machines may be frustrating for customers. Users still need to search for the product barcode or manually enter codes for fresh items like apples, which can be time-consuming, particularly for those unfamiliar with the system. In Figure 74 , we provide a simplified prototype to demonstrate the potential of GPT-4V in enabling an automatic self-checkout system that can identify and ring up items without user intervention.

When presented with a photograph of a shopping basket containing five grocery items, as shown in Figure 74a, GPT-4V fails to accurately identify the products within the basket. It mistakenly identifies strawberries as raspberries, crab dip as Greek yogurt, and includes salmon fillets that are not even present in the basket. However, in Figure 74b, we improve the prompt by augmenting it with catalog images of grocery products retrieved from the retail website. As a result, GPT-4V successfully identifies all five items in the basket. This successful demonstration allows the self-checkout system to proceed with retrieving the prices for each identified product from the database. While this is a simple example, it represents a significant step forward toward an automated self-checkout system. Further research and development can explore more complex and realistic scenarios to fully automate the self-checkout process, making it more efficient and convenient for customers.

### 9.3 Medical

In Section 4.1, the effectiveness of GPT-4V in medical image understanding is demonstrated through Figures 18-19. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed investigation into the application of GPT-4V in radiology report generation, as depicted in Figures 75-78. In this scenario, we provided GPT-4V with various medical images and tasked it with generating complete radiology reports. Since assessing the accuracy of the generated reports requires domain knowledge, we sought the evaluation of a medical professional.

Figure 75 showcases two accurate examples: one involving an abdominal X-ray image and another featuring an MRI of the right knee. In both cases, GPT-4V correctly identified the study and provided an accurate diagnosis. Moving on to Figure 76, we observe the generated radiology reports by GPT$4 \mathrm{~V}$ for X-ray images of the hand/wrist. While GPT-4V successfully diagnosed the recommended management based on the first X-ray image, it missed the obvious distal radial fracture present in the second X-ray image. Nevertheless, the generated reports maintain a high-quality format that can serve as a template, thus reducing the workload for medical professionals when drafting reports.

In Figure 77, we explore two additional examples involving a Chest CT and a Brain MRI. In the Chest CT case, GPT-4V mistakenly identified the mentioned nodule on the left side instead of the right side, and it also hallucinated the measurements. The ability to process interleaved image-text pairs also allows GPT-4V to reference prior medical scans and diagnosis histories, which is shown to be critical in medical professionals' diagnosing processes [15]. Figure 78 shows examples of understanding the symptom progression from multiple Chest X-Ray scans [60, 15]. These illustrations shed light on the potential of GPT-4V to serve as an AI assistant for radiology report generation. However, it is crucial to have the generated reports evaluated by medical professionals to ensure their correctness and accuracy.

### 9.4 Auto Insurance

In this section, we explore another practical application of GPT-4V in the field of auto insurance, focusing specifically on car accident reporting. Within this context, we can further delineate two distinct sub-categories: (i) Damage Evaluation and (ii) Insurance Reporting. The former involves the crucial task of accurately identifying and assessing the extent of damages sustained by vehicles, while the latter encompasses not only damage identification but also the recognition of vehicle-specific information depicted in images, such as the make, model, license plate, and other relevant details. By addressing both aspects, we aim to demonstrate the comprehensive capabilities of GPT-4V within the auto insurance domain.

Damage evaluation. We present an image depicting car damage to GPT-4V and prompt it with "Imagine that you are an expert in evaluating the car damage from car accident for auto insurance reporting. Please evaluate the damage seen in the image below." in Figure 79. GPT-4V has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in accurately identifying and precisely localizing the damages depicted in all four images. Furthermore, it impresses with its ability to provide detailed descriptions of each specific damage instance. In some instances, GPT-4V even endeavors to estimate the potential cost of repair.

Insurance reporting. Building on the success in damage evaluation, we modify our prompt to ask GPT-4V to identify the make, model, and license plate of the vehicle depicted in the image, and return the obtained information in JSON format. The examples depicted in Figure 80 showcase this capability. In both instances, GPT-4V attempts to extract all the requested details from the image. However, it should be noted that certain information may be unavailable, such as the estimated cost of repair, or challenging to discern due to occlusion, as observed with the license plate in the second image. It is important to note that real-life insurance reporting typically involves multiple images capturing the car from various angles, a scenario that is usually not publicly accessible on the Internet. Nevertheless, the examples in Figures 79-80 vividly illustrate the potential of GPT-4V in automating the insurance reporting process for car accidents.

## Damage Evaluation

Prompt:

Imagine that you are an expert in evaluating the car damage from car accident for auto insurance reporting. Please evaluate the damage seen in the image below.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-105.jpg?height=353&width=615&top_left_y=466&top_left_x=408)

## GPT-4V:

Based on the image, it appears that the car has sustained damage to the front passenger side bumper. The damage appears to be in the form of scrapes and scratches, with some areas of the paint chipped away. The damage appears to be cosmetic and does not appear to have affected the structural integrity of the bumper or the car. However, it is important to note that the image only shows one angle of the car and does not provide a full view of the damage. A more thorough inspection of the car would be needed to fully assess the extent of the damage and determine if there are any underlying issues that are not visible in the image.

## Prompt:

Imagine that you are an expert in evaluating the car damage from car accident for auto insurance reporting. Please evaluate the damage seen in the image below.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-105.jpg?height=357&width=515&top_left_y=1559&top_left_x=420)

## GPT-4V:

Based on the image, it appears that the car has sustained damage to the rear bumper and quarter panel on the driver's side. The bumper appears to be dented and scratched, and the quarter panel has a large dent and some scuff marks. It is likely that the car was hit from the side, causing the damage to the quarter panel and bumper. In terms of repair costs, the bumper may be able to be repaired with some minor body work and repainting. However, the quarter panel may require more extensive repairs or even replacement, which could be more costly. Overall, I would estimate the damage to be in the moderate to severe range, with repair costs likely in the thousands of dollars.

## Prompt:

Imagine that you are an expert in evaluating the car damage from car accident for auto insurance reporting. Please evaluate the damage seen in the image below.

## GPT-4V:

Based on the image, it appears that the vehicle has sustained significant damage to the front end. The hood is crumpled and the front bumper is partially detached. The headlights also appear to be damaged. It is likely that the vehicle was involved in a front-end collision. The damage appears to be primarily cosmetic, but it is possible that there may be underlying structural damage to the frame or engine. Further inspection would be required to assess the full extent of the damage. In terms of repair costs, the hood and bumper would likely need to be replaced, and the headlights may also need to be replaced or repaired. The cost of these repairs would depend on the make and model of the vehicle, but it is likely that the cost would be several thousand dollars at minimum.

Prompt:

Imagine that you are an expert in evaluating the car damage from car accident for auto insurance reporting. Please evaluate the damage seen in the image below.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9d9d323087fca7e90befg-105.jpg?height=355&width=480&top_left_y=1557&top_left_x=1080)

GPT-4V:

Based on the image, it appears that the vehicle has sustained significant damage to the front end. The hood is crumpled and the front bumper is completely detached from the vehicle. The headlights and grille are also damaged and the engine appears to be exposed. Additionally, there is damage to the driver's side fender and door. Given the extent of the damage, it is likely that the vehicle was involved in a high-speed collision or a head-on collision. The cost of repairs for this vehicle will likely be significant and it may be deemed a total loss by the insurance company.

### 9.5 Customized Captioner

Photo organization. In this scenario, let's picture that we have a family photo album. We demonstrate how GPT-4V can enhance the album by generating captions that explicitly mention the name of each family member shown in the photo. This personalized approach facilitates more precise and tailored photo organization, as illustrated in Figures 81-82. By providing GPT-4V with visual prompts for each family member, along with their respective names, GPT-4V can precisely identify the family members (including person, cat, and dog) to generate detailed and customized captions. Storing such captions for all the images in the family album holds the potential to enable highly personalized image search. For instance, a user could search for "a family photo of Linda, Cotton, Max, Sam, and Emma" and easily locate the corresponding family photo shown in Figure 81, or "Max lying between Sam and Emma" and locate the family photo in Figure 82.

Dense captioning w/ segmentation. We demonstrate the enhanced performance of GPT-4V in dense captioning by harnessing powerful segmentation models [65, 159, 160]. Figure 83 illustrates the dense captioning results by incorporating object cut-outs generated by SAM [65] into the prompt to extract more detailed captions for each object of interest. In addition, we provide GPT-4V with the original image as the global context and ask it to describe four object cut-outs as detailed as possible, and incorporating references to the context image.

The results show GPT-4V can generate highly intricate dense captions for each object, some of which are accompanied by relevant references to the context image. For instance, when describing object 3 (a frog), the dense caption makes mention of a close-up shot of a frog with a snail perched on its head, despite the absence of the snail in the corresponding cut-out for object 3. Similarly, when referring to object 4 (a turtle), GPT-4V recognizes from the context image that the turtle is floating in water, thereby further enriching the generated caption.

## GPT-4V:

Object 1 is a close-up of a snail shell. The shell is a light beige color with a spiral pattern on the top. The shell appears to be slightly weathered, with some small chips and cracks visible on the edges. The background is white, making the shell the focal point of the image. The shell is positioned at a slight angle, with the spiral pattern on the top facing towards the right side of the image.

Object 2 is a close-up of a snail. The snail has a light orange-colored shell with a spiral pattern. The body of the snail is a darker orange color with small bumps on its skin. The snail's head is extended forward and its antennae are visible. The background of the image is white, making the snail the focal point of the image.

Object 3 is a close-up of a frog with a snail on its head. The frog is light green in color with a pinkish hue on its underside. It has large, bulging eyes that are black and white. The snail is orange and is perched on top of the frog's head. The frog is sitting on a rock or other flat surface with its legs tucked underneath its body. The background is white, making the frog and snail stand out.

Object 4 shows a close-up of a turtle's head and neck, with its body partially visible. The turtle appears to be floating in water, with its head and neck extended upwards. The turtle's skin is green and its shell is grey with black stripes. The shell appears to be damaged, with a large chunk missing from the top. The turtle's eyes are closed and its mouth is slightly open.

### 9.6 Image Generation

In this section, we make connections with another prominent area of multimodal research: visual synthesis. By delving into the realm of image generation, we explore how GPT-4V can contribute to this field through various avenues, including evaluation and prompting.

Evaluation of generated images. Figure 66 in Section 8.2 demonstrates the capability of GPT-4V in assessing the aesthetics of images. Here, we show how we employ GPT-4V to evaluate the generated images based on their alignment with the given prompts for text-to-image generation, inspired by RL-Diffusion [18]. RL-Diffusion leverages a VL model LLAVA [79] to describe the generated image, followed by text similarity computation between the prompt and the image description using BERT [38]. The resulting text similarity score serves as the feedback signal to guide the training of the diffusion model through reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, Figures 84-85 exhibit how GPT-4V, as a single model, can effectively rate the similarity between the generated image and the prompt. Moreover, GPT-4V provides explanations for the deduction in similarity score, which can potentially be used as a feedback to improve the image generation.

In Figure 84, we present the evaluation of image similarity using the prompt, "What is happening in the image? From a scale of 1 to 10 , rate the similarity between the image and the text prompt 'a parrot driving a car'." GPT-4V assigns a score of 1 to the most irrelevant image (a dolphin jumping over the water), while rating the most relevant image at the bottom with a score of 9 . Notably, the last three images in Figure 84 are shown in RL-Diffusion as gradually improved generation results for the text prompt "a parrot driving a car." The ratings assigned by GPT-4V to these three images $(4 \rightarrow 8$ $\rightarrow 9$ ) align with the refinement process.

Figure 85 showcases the evaluation of image generation results that involve text rendering on a cake. Leveraging its robust optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities, GPT-4V accurately recognizes the rendered texts in the generated images, such as "Azuze Research," "ARAUIE," and "Azure Azure," and compares them to the text prompt requirement, which is "Azure Research."

Prompt generation for image editing. In addition to its remarkable ability to evaluate generated images, GPT-4V offers a valuable feature that can greatly enhance image editing. By generating or rewriting the text prompt used for editing, GPT-4V can refine the edited image, resulting in a more visually appealing outcome. Figure 86 provides a demonstration of how we can harness the power of GPT-4V to generate a text prompt specifically tailored for image editing. By providing the original image and text requirements that describe the desired edits, GPT-4V produces an optimized prompt for the task at hand. This optimized prompt takes into account the unique characteristics of the image, ensuring that the subsequent editing process is well-informed and effective.

Moreover, Figure 87 showcases another use case of GPT-4V to improve image editing by rewriting the editing prompt. By considering the original image, the initial prompt, and the edited image, GPT-4V can generate an improved version of the prompt that incorporates the changes made during the previous editing process. One can alternate the processes depicted in Figures 86-87, allowing users to refine their edits repeatedly until they achieve a satisfying outcome. Consequently, this iterative process has the potential to significantly enhance the overall quality of the edited image, providing users with more control and creative freedom in their image editing endeavors.

### 9.7 Embodied Agent

In this section, we delve into the exciting applications and implications of GPT-4V for embodied AI, exploring how it is poised to bridge the gap between multimodal understanding on static inputs and physical interaction with dynamic environments. To provide a concrete illustration, let us consider the scenario of GPT-4V assuming the role of a home robot. Within this context, we witness how it can read the menu to operate household appliances (e.g., coffee machine), and perform task-oriented navigation through the house.

Operating machine. Imagine you've just acquired a brand-new coffee machine, and to your delight, your trusty home robot, GPT-4V, learns how to operate it on your behalf. In our experiment, we provide GPT-4V with a single image (Figure 88) featuring an operating menu with both illustrations and texts. Our task for GPT-4V is to identify the button that corresponds to the " $8 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee" option within the coffee machine's operating panel. Surprisingly, GPT-4V not only accurately locates the " $8 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee" button but also successfully recognizes the button for " $10 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee." However, it mistakenly identifies the power button as the " $6 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee" button, potentially due to the visual confusion caused by the positioning of the " $6 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee" option on both the menu and the coffee machine itself. To address this specific failure case, we devise a solution by isolating the operating menu for each button and presenting them all to GPT-4V in a single prompt (Figure 89). With this revised approach, GPT-4V now can recognize the precise position of the " $6 \mathrm{OZ}$ coffee" button.

Navigation. In order to explore navigation capabilities, we utilized Redfin virtual house tour as a means to replicate interactive environments for embodied agents. The objective was to assess the performance of GPT-4V in a task-oriented scenario. To illustrate this, we present an example depicted in Figures 90-91. Initially, we provided GPT-4V with the entry image of a virtual house tour, offering a view from one corner into the living room. The task assigned to GPT-4V was to "go to the kitchen and retrieve an item from the fridge." Our aim was to prompt GPT-4V to predict the subsequent actions.

In the first step, as shown in the first half of Figure 90, GPT-4V anticipated the initial action by suggesting to "turn right and move forward towards the hallway." This prediction was based on GPT-4V's hypothesis that the kitchen would likely be located in that direction. We then manually executed this action using the visual house touring portal, capturing the resulting view after the action was taken. This view was then used to prompt GPT-4V for the next action, as displayed in the second half of Figure 90. It's important to note that throughout the process, we maintained a record of the immediate previous turn to provide context for GPT-4V's subsequent actions.

As the navigation process unfolded, we successfully reached the fridge within the third turn, as indicated by the query image in the second half of Figure 91. The final action predicted by GPT-4V was to "move forward and slightly to the left in order to align myself with the fridge door. Then, use my robotic arm to open the fridge door and retrieve the requested item." This decisive action marked the accomplishment of GPT-4V in this task-oriented navigation scenario.

### 9.8 GUI Navigation

Beyond navigating the physical world, this section showcases the capability of GPT-4V to interact with and navigate through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a computer or smartphone. We explore the potential for GPT-4V to complete complex tasks, such as web browsing, online shopping, and etc.

Web browsing. We assess the performance of GPT-4V on computer GUI navigation under a task-oriented setting. The model was provided with the screenshot of current computer screen, the end goal of the navigation (e.g., finding a cooking recipe or reading today's news), the list of possible actions (e.g., move the mouse, click an icon with the mouse, or type some texts with the keyboard). The model is then instructed to predict the subsequent actions (refer to Figure 92 for a complete prompt example). Upon the model's prediction, we manually execute the predicted action and capture a screenshot, which served as the input for GPT-4V for the next turn. When the predicted action is to move the mouse, GPT-4V is specifically instructed to detail the mouse's position. Hence, the predicted actions are grounded, showing the potential of automating the whole process without human in the loop.

In Figures 92-96, GPT-4V predicts reasonable actions to operate a computer GUI, and finally accomplish the end goal of finding a recipe of Mapo Tofu and print out a copy of the recipe in Figure 95. We then provide GPT-4V a screenshot of the printed recipe and ask it to describe the printout as detailed as possible. As shown in Figure 96, GPT-4V is able to recognize the details presented in the printout, including the cooking time, the list of ingredients, the author of the recipe, the link to the original recipe and etc. Figures 97-102 present how GPT-4V can navigate through GUI to browse the web to "read today's news". Despite the minor errors in Figure 100 when it tries to return to the previous search result page to continue browsing for more news articles, GPT-4V can perform the navigation and read two news articles reasonably well.

Online shopping. Figures 103-111 illustrates how GPT-4V can navigate a smartphone GUI for online shopping. Similarly, we provide GPT-4V with the screenshot of the current phone screen, the list of possible actions (e.g., move your finger to an icon, click an icon with your finger, scroll down a screen, or type some texts with the keyboard) and ask it to predict the subsequent actions to shop for an ergonomic keyboard with a budget between $\$ 50$ and $\$ 100$. GPT-4V predicts to open the Amazon app (Figure 103), search ergonomic keyboard (Figure 104), open the filter options (Figure 105), set the price range filter between $\$ 50$ and $\$ 100$ (Figure 106), show filtered results (Figure 107), select the top search result (Figure 108), view product details (Figure 109), add product to the shopping cart (Figure 110) and finally proceed to checkout (Figure 111).

Notification understanding. Notifications are integral to modern human-computer interactions. GPT-4V has demonstrated its capacity to interpret notification content and respond accordingly. As shown in Figure 112, the model can read and respond to a notification, such as suggesting to open the Maps app in response to a meeting proposal in Seattle. It also handles call (Figure 113) and message (Figure 114) notifications on a computer screen effectively.

Watching videos. Alongside web browsing, videos are a key source of online information. GPT-4V has shown its capability to describe video content based on a series of screenshots from popular short-form videos. Regardless of whether the video has subtitle overlay (Figure 115 and 116) or not (Figure 117, 118, 119), GPT-4V can generate insightful descriptions about the video content, demonstrating its potential in automatic transcript generation for user-generated video content.

Instructions
1. First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat
your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and
dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the
peppers don't bum. Remove from heat and set aside
2. Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1
minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the
peppercorns and stir for about 15 -30 seconds taking care to not let it burn as it will tum
bitter if it does
3. Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the chicken broth to the wo
and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu and
combine the water and cornstarch in a small bow
4. Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to
thicken. (ff it gets too thick splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)
5. Then add your chili oil from before-peppers and all! I f you are using homemade chili oil,
ONLY use the standing oil, as its likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not
additional salt. Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the
tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for $3-5$ minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using)
along with the scallions and stir until the scallions are just wilted.
6. Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peopercorn powder as a gamish if desired

The State Department on Tuesday defended NATO's hesitation to invite Ukraine into the alliance, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced his frustration with how the negotiations have unfolded.

State Department press secretary Matthew Miller spoke to reporters on Tuesday from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, where NATO's two-day summit is being held this week. Miller cited several conditions that NATO had decided Ukraine must meet for an invitation to the alliance, including democratic reforms and the end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.
"We are ready to extend an invitation when conditions are met," Miller said. "There is an important reason why they are not becoming a member of NATO right now - because it would instantly put the United States in a shooting wa with Russia."

Miller echoed the sentiment of President Joe Biden, who told CNN on Sunday that Ukraine could not be admitted into the alliance until the war with Russia had ended, adding that "if the war is going on, then we're all in war."

The U.S. has doubled down this week on military support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, agreeing to include controversial cluster munitions in its next arms package to Kyiv - a decision that Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov said would be a "game changer" as the Ukrainian counteroffensive struggles to breach Russia's front lines.

In a summit communiqué released Tuesday, NATO leaders wrote that the alliance could not promise Ukraine membership until the war had ended and several democratic and security-sector reforms had been achieved.

"We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met," the leaders wrote.

In a statement posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Zelenskyy took issue with NATO's reluctance to commit to admitting his country, and its unwillingness to provide an anticipated timeline for Ukraine's entry. He wrote that he did not se sufficient readiness on the part of NATO to integrate Ukraine into the alliance.

"It's unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine's membership," Zelenskyy wrote. "While at the same time vague wording about 'conditions' is added even for inviting Ukraine.'

The article also mentions that during a press conference on Tuesday, Zelensky reiterated his commitment to strengthening democracy in Ukraine, which is a necessary condition for NATO membership.

The article discusses the catastrophic flooding that occurred in Vermont's capital, Montpelier, on Tuesday, July 11, 2023. The flooding was caused by intense rainstorms that inundated the Northeast, leading to evacuations and closures in the area.

The floods were described as "unprecedented" and "historic" by officials, with some areas experiencing record-breaking rainfall. The National Weather Service issued a travel advisory, warning residents to avoid non-essential travel.

Vermont Governor Phil Scott declared a state of emergency, and New Hampshire sent rescue crews and Black Hawk helicopters to assist with the response. The Vermont Fire Department and other emergency services were also dispatched to the affected areas.

The floods caused extensive damage to homes and businesses, with some residents being forced to evacuate. A boil water notice was issued for Montpelier, and officials began clearing debris from roadways on Wednesday.

In Oklahoma City, two children were rescued from a reservoir after being swept away by floodwaters. The children, aged 10 and 11, were among a group of four that were fishing in the area.

In New York, Hurricane Irene caused 8 inches of rain within a 24 -hour period, leading to major infrastructure damage. A state of emergency was declared for Long Lake Town Supervisor Clay Arsenault, and residents were urged to evacuate.

The article concludes with a quote from Dan Hancock, a resident of Chester, Vermont, who watched floodwater enter his basement. He expresses his frustration and helplessness, stating "Once the water goes down, we go back in, clean it up and move on. What can we do?"

## 10 LMM Powered Agents

In this section, we discuss possible future research directions that may further amplify GPT-4V's capabilities. The discussion focuses on how the intriguing usages in LLMs may extend to the multimodal scenario and its enabled new abilities, e.g., multimodal plugins, multimodal chains, self-reflection, self-consistency, and retrieval-augmented LMMs, etc. In the following sub-sections, we use human-generated examples to illustrate potential ways to enhance GPT-4V-based systems.

## Sec. 10.1 Multimodal Plugins

## Calling Bing Image Search...

- This image is taken in izmir, Turkey
- The image is related to an earthquake event
- To summarize, this image was taken in İmir, Turkey, during a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in Turkey's Aegean region. The scene shows the aftermath of the disaster with people standing in a pile of rubble, a crane lifting a truck, and a red truck with a black front.

Figure 120: Illustration of using the Bing Image Search [94] plugin to enable GPT-4V with timesensitive knowledge (bottom, highlighted in green ). Note that the earthquake happened on February 6, 2023, which is after GPT-4V's training, thereby GPT-4V fails to identify the exact location without plugin (top). Check Section 10.1 for detailed discussions.

## Sec. 10.2 Multimodal Chains

Figure 121: Extending GPT-4V to multimodal chains with ReAct [145, 142] for PPE Counting scenario. Check Section 10.2 for detailed discussions.

### 10.1 Multimodal Plugins

In the context of LLMs, plugins [98, 56, 6, 112, 87, 103] play a crucial role in assisting LLMs for various tasks such as accessing the latest information, performing computations, or utilizing thirdparty services. These plugins are primarily designed to process inputs in natural language or inputs that can be interpreted as language, such as code and math equations. To illustrate the significance of multimodal plugins, such as Bing Image Search [94], especially in the context of LMMs, we present Figure 120. By incorporating the Bing Image Search plugin, we empower GPT-4V to acquire timesensitive knowledge related to the input image. In the upper part of the figure, we demonstrate the limitations of GPT-4V without Bing Image Search plugin. It fails to accurately answer the question, "Where was this photo taken?" due to the fact that the photo captures the aftermath of a massive earthquake that occurred on February 6, 2023, at the border of Turkey and Syria-a situation that took place after GPT-4V's training. Since constantly retraining the model with current information can be computationally intensive and expensive, plugins like search engines prove to be invaluable resources for the model to access up-to-date information. In the lower part of Figure 120, we showcase the capabilities of GPT-4V when equipped with the Bing Image Search plugin. It effectively leverages the retrieved information from the plugin, enabling accurate identification of the location İzmir, Turkey.

### 10.2 Multimodal Chains

Chaining with LLMs has been explored extensively in recent research [145, 47, 124, 107]. This approach goes beyond using a single plugin and instead establishes a system paradigm that integrates LLMs with a pool of plugins, enabling more advanced reasoning and interactions. By replacing language-only plugins with vision/multimodal experts such as image captioners, object detectors, or well-trained models for text-to-image generation and audio-to-text conversion, it becomes possible to construct a powerful multimodal chain with LLMs [137, 142, 121, 114, 75, 86].

However, the interactions within these chains between LLMs and the plugins typically take place in text format. Although the plugins may accept multimodal inputs, they return results in text to enhance the knowledge of LLMs. There is a notable exception in the case of image synthesis/editing [137], where the plugins can generate images, but these images are not fed back into LLMs for further analysis or knowledge augmentation, as LLMs can only process language-based inputs.

In Figure 121, we present an illustration of how GPT-4V, can be extended to support multimodal chains with ReAct $[145,142]$. This extension enables the plugins in the chain to provide multimodal information, which can then be collectively processed by GPT-4V to achieve advanced reasoning in scenarios such as PPE counting. The entire chaining process shown in Figure 121 is divided into two rounds of thought, action, and observation, with each round involving the activation of a specific plugin. In the first round, GPT-4V deduces that person detection is necessary to count the number of people wearing helmets (Thought 1). Consequently, it calls the person detector tool (Action 1) and receives the coordinates of bounding boxes for each detected person in the image (Observation 1). Moving to the second round, based on the obtained bounding box information, GPT-4V infers that there are a total of 8 people in the image (Thought 2). It then utilizes the image cropping tool to crop out individual images of each person according to their corresponding bounding box coordinates (Action 2). The resulting outputs (Observation 2) consist of 8 labeled images, numbered from image 1 to image 8. GPT-4V subsequently determines whether each person in these images is wearing a helmet or not, and summarizes the total count of people wearing helmets.

Overall, this integration of LMMs with a pool of multimodal plugins opens up new possibilities for enhanced reasoning and interaction, leveraging the strengths of both language and vision capabilities. The flexibility of multimodal chains allows for a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of multimodal data, and can potentially lead to improved performance in various applications.

### 10.3 Self-Reflection

Figure 122 demonstrates the application of self-reflection [116, 88, 63] to improve the results shown in Figure 47. As we can see, the self-reflected result is better aligned with the reference image. For example, on the left side, the number of data points is corrected from 4 to 3 , while on the right side, the percentage is added back above the bar. Although the result is still not exactly identical, it is evident that self-reflection can facilitate manual polishing. Figure 123 shows another example of self-reflection in improving the prompt generation for text-to-image models [106].

There are 4 boats in the image.

Figure 124: Improve the counting reliability with self-consistency [130], which aggregates multiple counting results repeated on the same image. Check Section 10.4 for detailed discussions.

### 10.4 Self-Consistency

Self-consistency [130] is a decoding strategy that aggregates multiple sampled outputs to produce the final answer, such as with the majority vote. Extended from marginalizing to aggregating final answers, Tree-of-Thoughts [144] shows that the self-consistency idea can be applied to intermediate thoughts to improve the LLM reasoning performance. Figure 124 illustrates the use of self-consistency on GPT-4V for counting problems. We sample multiple counting results by asking GPT-4V to count
the same image multiple times, either conducting multiple runs (Samples 2-4) or rephrasing the input text instruction (Samples 1,2). The example then uses the simple majority vote to aggregate the final answer of " 4 boats." We leave the comprehensive explorations of self-consistency LMMs to future works.

### 10.5 Retrieval-Augmented LMMs

Retrieval-Augmented LMMs [93, 68, 50, 19, 115, 104] enhances text generation by retrieving and integrating relevant information into prompts. The technique is particularly effective when specialized task-relevant information is needed, such as expert knowledge in a highly-specialized expert domain, the most recent information that may differ from LLMs' memory, and the customizable information that varies from user to user. We imagine retrieval augmentation continues to play an essential role in LMMs. Figure 74 shows an example of retrieval-augmented LMMs helping grocery checkout. Since the produces' image-text-price triplets are different in each store, it would be beneficial to retrieve them from the store's database and yield the correct checkout information. Similarly, in Figure 81's the customized captioning scenario, we imagine the system may automatically retrieve the family members' photos from the album and achieve the customized captioning.

## 11 Conclusions

### 11.1 Summary and Conclusions

In this report, our primary focus is on probing GPT-4V across various application scenarios. The findings reveal its remarkable capabilities, some of which have not been investigated or demonstrated in existing approaches. While we strive to uncover as many of these capabilities as possible, we acknowledge that our presentation may not be exhaustive. Nevertheless, this report can serve as a reference for future research aimed at exploring additional uses of GPT-4V, deepening the understanding of LMMs, and building even more powerful LMMs.

### 11.2 Towards Future LMMs

The weaknesses and limitations of GPT models have been extensively discussed in related reports [ 99 , $100,24]$. In this section, we briefly focus on presenting our perspective on future research directions.

Models like GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3 function primarily as text-in-text-out systems, capable of processing natural language only. GPT-4 (no vision) demonstrates unparalleled competence in text understanding and generation, while GPT-4V exhibits a strong ability to comprehend the image domain as well.

As a natural progression, LMMs should be able to generate interleaved image-text content, such as producing vivid tutorials containing both text and images, to enable comprehensive multimodal content understanding and generation. Additionally, it would be beneficial to incorporate other modalities, such as video, audio, and other sensor data, to expand the capabilities of LMMs.

Regarding the learning process, current approaches predominantly rely on well-organized data, such as image-tag or image-text datasets. However, a more versatile model may be able to learn from various sources, including online web content and even real-world physical environments, to facilitate continuous self-evolution.
