#### Abstract

In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to enhance blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models for social media videos. Motivated by previous researches that leverage pre-trained features extracted from various computer vision models as the feature representation for BVQA, we further explore rich quality-aware features from pretrained blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models as auxiliary features to help the BVQA model to handle complex distortions and diverse content of social media videos. Specifically, we use SimpleVQA, a BVQA model that consists of a trainable Swin Transformer-B and a fixed SlowFast, as our base model. The Swin Transformer$B$ and SlowFast components are responsible for extracting spatial and motion features, respectively. Then, we extract three kinds of features from Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA to capture frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. Through concatenating these features, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three public social media VQA datasets. Moreover, the proposed model won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/sunwei925/RQ-VQA.git.


## 1. Introduction

Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) [27] aims to provide a perceptual quality score of the video without access to any reference information (i.e., high-quality source videos), which has increasingly played a crucial role in video processing systems of steaming media applications, ensuring that end-users can view high-quality videos and have a superior Quality of Experience (QoE). Towards[^0]

this goal, numerous BVQA models have been proposed to achieve better correlation with human subjective opinions, including knowledge-driven models [12,35,43,44] and data-driven models [14,15, 19,38-40,51,58,59].

Although knowledge-driven BVQA models [5, 12, 35, 43, 44] have better interpretability, they often exhibit relatively poor performance and higher computational complexity compared to data-driven approaches, mainly due to complex human perception processes involved in assessing visual quality. With the rapid development of deep neural network (DNN), data-driven BVQA models have demonstrated excellent performance on various kinds of videos, including professionally generated content (PGC) videos with synthetic distortions [23] and user-generated content (UGC) videos with realistic distortions [19,38,49,51].

The success of data-driven BVQA models can be attributed to two factors. The first is the adoption of more advanced neural networks, including convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods (e.g., VSFA [15], SimpleVQA [38], Li22 [14], etc.), Transformer-based methods (e.g. StarVQA [57], FAST-VQA [51], etc.), and recent large multi-modality (LLM)-based methods (e.g. QAlign [56]). The second is the construction of large-scale subjective labeled video quality assessment (VQA) datasets (e.g., LSVQ [59], etc.), enabling the DNN models learn quality-aware feature representation from the videos and the corresponding quality labels.

As data-driven methods, the performance of BVQA models relies heavily on the human-rated VQA datasets. However, the videos in current mainstreaming VQA datasets [9, 10, 33, 37, 48, 59] were typically captured by outdated cameras or collected from video sharing websites several years ago. The distortion types and video content may not align with the videos in current streaming video applications especially social media applications, as the shooting devices and video processing algorithms including pre-processing, compression, and enhancement algorithms, have greatly improved. Therefore, the BVQA model trained by these VQA datasets may not have sufficient capability to evaluate the perceptual quality of the millions of newly social media videos uploaded daily.

Figure 1. The comparison of PGC videos, UGC videos, and the processed UGC videos.

In this paper, we focus on BVQA models for social media videos ${ }^{1}$, which exhibit two distinct characteristics: 1) the video content usually includes lots of special effects, text descriptions, subtitled, etc., 2) the videos undergo complex processing workflows including pre-processing, transcoding, and enhancement. We show some typical social media videos in Figure 1.

In the literature, Sun et al. propose a BVQA framework named SimpleVQA, comprising a trainable spatial quality module and a fixed temporal quality module, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This framework shows excellent extensibility in accommodating various scenarios, including surveillance video quality assessment [62] and point cloud quality assessment [63], etc. Moreover, Zhang et al. [65] extract geometry features (i.e., dihedral angle, gaussian curvature, and NSS parameters) of the mesh of digital human and integrated them into the SimpleVQA framework to assess the quality of dynamic digital human. Wen et al. [50] propose a spatial rectifier and temporal rectifier within the SimpleVQA framework to address variable spatial resolution and frame rate video quality assessment problems. These studies indicate that with proper quality-aware features, SimpleVQA can effectively handle various types of quality assessment problems.

Therefore, we also resort to the SimpleVQA framework to address the social media BVQA problem. Given the diverse content of social media videos and the variety of video processing algorithms they undergo, training SimpleVQA end-to-end may require a large-scale of VQA datasets to achieve the robust quality feature representation, while the newest social media VQA dataset, KVQ [24], comprises only 3,600 quality-labeled videos. Inspired by prior[^1]

works $[50,65]$, we enhance SimpleVQA with rich qualityaware features derived from state-of-the-art blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and BVQA models, which helps to alleviate the model's reliance on training data and improve its robustness.

To be more specific, we choose two BIQA models, LIQE [61] and Q-Align [56], and one BVQA model, FASTVQA [51], to extract frame-level quality-aware features, frame-level quality-aware along with scene-specific features, and spatiotemporal quality-aware features, respectively. LIQE and Q-Align are both vision-language based BIQA models. For LIQE, we use the textual template: " $a$ photo of $a(n)\{s\}$ with $\{d\}$ artifacts, which is of $\{c\}$ quality" and calculate the cosine similarity between the visual embedding of the test image and the textual embedding of the text prompt. The parameters " $s$ ", " $d$ ", and " $c$ " belong to nine scene categories, eleven distortion types, and five distortion levels respectively, and total 495 text prompts are tested to derive 495 dimensional LIQE features. For QAlign, we use the conversation formats: "\#User: 〈 image \rangle How would you rate the quality of this image? \#Assistant: The quality of the image is $\langle$ level $\rangle . "$, where $\langle$ image \rangle and $\langle$ level $\rangle$ denote the image token and image quality level respectively. We extract Q-Align features by computing the hidden embedding of the last encoder layer. FASTVQA features are computed by global average pooling the last-stage feature maps. Then, we use Swin Transformer$\mathrm{B}$ [21] as the spatial quality analyzer and the temporal pathway of the SlowFast [6] network as the temporal quality analyzer. To further enhance the spatial feature representation, we add a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) [45] after the feature maps extracted by the Swin Transformer-B to capture salience information and guide the spatial feature extraction. Finally, we concatenate the SimpleVQA features (including both spatial and temporal features), LIQE features, Q-Align features, and FAST-VQA features and
regress them into video quality scores by a two-layer multilayer perception (MLP) network. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PLCC) loss is used to optimize the entire BVQA model. Our model achieves the best performance on three UGC VQA datasets and achieve the first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge [16].

The core contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We enhance the SimpleVQA framework with three kinds of quality-aware pre-trained features, yielding outstanding performance on social media UGC VQA datasets and also exhibiting remarkable robustness and generalizability.
- We utilize the MHSA module to capture the salience frame regions that influence the visual quality, thereby enhancing the fine-grained quality assessment capabilities.


## 2. Related Work

### 2.1. VQA Datasets

Early VQA datasets primarily focus on synthetic distortions introduced by different video processing stages, such as spatiotemporal downsampling [13, 18, 25, 26, 32], compression [3, 18, 36, 47], transmission [2, 4, 8, 31], etc. These datasets typically consist of a limited number of high-quality source videos and the corresponding distorted ones. Due to limited video content and not considering the realistic distortions, these datasets are not suitable for training general BVQA models. Therefore, recent VQA datasets $[9,10,33,37,48,59$ ] have shifted focus towards realistic captured distortions. For example, LIVE-Qualcomm [9] consists of 208 videos captured by 8 smartphones across 54 unique scenes. LIVE-VQC [37] includes 585 videos captured by 80 mobile cameras, encompassing different lighting conditions and diverse levels of motion, each video corresponding to a unique scene. LSVQ [59] consists of 38,811 videos sampled from the Internet Archive and YFCC100M datasets by matching six video feature distributions. In general, These datasets have greatly promoted the development of objective BVQA models.

However, for videos on social media platforms like Kwai and TikTok, their quality is influenced by both in-captured distortions and distortions caused by video processing algorithms. Hence, some studies have started to construct social media VQA datasets. For instance, Li et al. [17] selected 50 source videos from TikTok and then two encoders (i.e. H. 264 and H.265) were used to compress each video with five QPs to simulate the video transcoding procedure. Yu et al. [60] sampled 55 1080p videos from LIVEVQC [37], downscaled them to four different resolutions, and subsequently compressed using H. 264 across 17 compression levels. To streamline the human study, a sampling strategy was employed to select 220 represented distorted video for the subjective VQA study. Zhang et al. [64] constructed the TaoLive dataset, containing 418 raw videos from the TaoLive platform and 3, 762 distorted videos compressed at 8 different CRF levels using H.265. Gao et al. [7] studied the impact of video enhancement algorithms on UGC videos and constructed the VDPVE dataset, which includes 184 low-quality videos and 1,211 videos enhanced by light/contrast/color, deblurring, stabilization algorithms. Wu et al. [53] introduced the MaxWell dataset with 4,543 videos labeled with multi-attribute scores on 16 dimensions. Lu et al. [24] introduced the KVQ dataset to further study the impact of complete video processing workflows, including pre-processing, transcoding, and enhancement, on video quality. The dataset consists of 600 user-upload social media videos and 3,600 processed videos.

In this paper, we focus on quality assessment for UGC videos processed by multiple video processing algorithms (called social media videos in this paper), which is more challenging to BVQA models because of their diverse distortions introduced during both capture and video editing/processing stages.

### 2.2. BVQA Models

As stated in Section 1, we can roughly divide the BVQA models into knowledge-driven methods and data-driven methods.

Knowledge-driven BVQA models [5,12,29,35,43,44] utilize carefully designed handcrafted features to quantify the video quality. For example, V-BLIINDS [35] utilizes spatiotemporal natural scene statistics (NSS) models to quantify the NSS features of frame differences and motion coherency characteristics, and then regresses these features to video scores by support vector regressor (SVR). Mittal et al. [29] propose a training-free blind VQA model named VIIDEO that exploits intrinsic statistics regularities of natural videos to quantify disturbances introduced due to distortions. TLVQM [12] extracts rich spatiotemporal features such as motion, jerkiness, blurriness, noise, blockiness, color, etc. from both high and low complexity levels. VIDEVAL [43] employs the sequential forward floating selection strategy to choose a set of quality-aware features from typical BI/VQA methods, followed by training an SVR model to regress them into the video quality. TLVQM and VIDEVAL demonstrate that leveraging rich qualityaware handcrafted features enables the BVQA model to achieve better performance. In this paper, we show that combining diverse quality-aware features extracted from DNNs with a base BVQA model (e.g. SimpleVQA) can also achieve superior performance. .

Data-driven BVQA methods $[14,15,19,20,38,40,49,51$,

58, 59] mainly leverage DNNs to extract the quality-aware features. For instance, Liu et al. [20] introduce a multi-task BVQA model, optimizing the 3D-CNN for quality assessment and compression distortion classification simultaneously. VSFA [15] first extracts semantic features from a pre-trained CNN model, followed by utilizing a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to capture the temporal relationship among the semantic features of video frames. Yi et al. [58] propose an attention mechanism based BVQA model, which employs a non-local operator to handle uneven spatial distortion problems. Ying et al. [59] introduce a local-to-global region-based BVQA model, combing the quality-aware features extracted from a BIQA pre-trained and spatiotemporal features from a pre-trained action recognition network. Li et al. [14] also employ the IQA model pre-trained on multiple databases to extract quality-aware spatial features and the action recognition model to extract temporal features, subsequently utilizing a GRU network is used to regress spatial and temporal features into the quality scores. Sun et al. $[38,40]$ propose SimpleVQA, a BVQA framework that consists of a trainable spatial feature extraction module and a pre-trained motion feature extraction model. In this paper, we adopt SimpleVQA as our base model. Wu et al. [51] propose FAST-VQA, which samples spatio-temporal grid mini-cubes from original videos and trains a fragment attention network consisting of a Swin transformer and the gated relative position biases in an endto-end manner. Wu et al. [52] further propose DOVER, which integrates FAST-VQA with an aesthetics quality assessment branch to evaluate video quality from both technique and aesthetics perspectives. With the popularity of large multi-modality models (LMMs), some LMM-based quality assessment models [11,54-56] have been proposed to evaluate the image/video quality by providing predefined text prompts to LMMs.

Recently, there have been efforts to integrate various types of DNN features to enhance BVQA performance and provide explainability. For example, Wang et al. [49] propose a feature-rich BVQA model that assesses quality from three aspects including compression level, video content, and distortion type, with each aspect evaluated by a separate neural network. Liu et al. [19] extract seven types of features extracted by EfficientNet-b7 [41], ir-CSN-152 [42], CLIP [34], Swin Transformer-B [21], TimeSformer [1], Video Swin Transformer-B [22], and SlowFast [6] to represent content-aware, distortion-aware, and motion-aware features of videos. They incorporate these quality representations as supplementary supervisory information to train a lightweight BVQA model in a knowledge manner. These studies demonstrate the potential for BVQA models to benefit from various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we further demonstrate that BVQA models can achieve better performance with quality-aware pre-trained features.

## 3. Proposed Model

As depicted in Figure 2, our BVQA model builds upon SimpleVQA, incorporating Swin Transformer-B for learning spatial quality feature representation and leveraging the temporal path of SlowFast for modeling motion characteristics. We integrate three kinds of quality-aware features including LIQE, Q-Align, and FAST-VQA into SimpleVQA to enhance its quality-aware feature representation, thereby improving its capability to handle complex distortions of social media videos introduced during capture and video editing/processing procedures.

### 3.1. Video Pre-processing

Given a video $\boldsymbol{x}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, where $\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ represents the $i$-th frame. Here, $H$ and $W$ denote the height and the width of each frame respectively, and $N$ is the total number of frames. The features extracted by our method can be categorized into three levels: spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal. Therefore, we partition the video into three parts: key frames, video chunks, and the entire video. For key frames, we sample the first frame of every one-second video frame sequence as the key frame, denoted as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{z} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right\}_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \\
N_{z} & =N / r  \tag{1}\\
\boldsymbol{z}_{i} & =\boldsymbol{x}_{i * r}
\end{align*}
$$

where $r$ represents the frame rate of the video $\boldsymbol{x}$. For video chunks, we split the video $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a series of video chunks:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{V} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)}\right\}_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \\
\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)} & =\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{s}\right\}_{s=i * r}^{(i+1) * r-1} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Specifically, each key frame corresponds to one video chunk. For the entire video, the video $\boldsymbol{x}$ is directly used as the input.

### 3.2. The Base Model

We adopt SimpleVQA [38] as our base model, which utilizes a trainable spatial quality analyzer to extract spatial quality-ware features and employs a fixed temporal quality analyzer to capture motion features. Recent study [40] suggests that most VQA datasets are dominated by spatial distortions and pose little challenge to the temporal quality analyzer. Therefore, we choose a high-performance backbone Swin Transformer-B [21] as our spatial quality analyzer. We drop out the classification head of Swin TransformerB and add a MHSA module [45] to guide the spatial quality analyzer to focus on salience regions of video frames that affect video quality. We finally apply global average pooling to obtain the spatial quality representation. We denote these procedures as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\operatorname{MHSA}\left(\operatorname{SwinB}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right)\right)\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 2. The framework of the proposed BVQA model. We use SimpleVQA as the base model, which consists of a Swin Transformer-B and a SlowFast. We extract three quality-aware features using LIQE, Q-Align, and FAST-VQA as the auxiliary features. These features are then concatenated and regressed into the quality score via a MLP network.

where GP, MHSA, and SwinB represent global average pooling, MHSA module, and Swin Transformer-B without the classification head operators. $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}$ is the spatial features of $i$-th key frames.

The temporal quality analyzer is designed to extract video motion information, which is important for detecting distortions such as jitter caused by unstable shooting equipment or lagging resulting from low bandwidth during streaming. Following the approaches [38,40], we use the fast pathway of SlowFast to extract motion features for each video chunk. We also remove the classification head of SlowFast and calculate the temporal features by global average pooling the last-stage feature maps:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\operatorname{SlowFast}\left(\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where SlowFast denotes the SlowFast without the classification head. $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}$ is the temporal features of $i$-th video chunk.

### 3.3. LIQE Features

LIQE is a multi-task learning based visual-language model for BIQA. It employs the CLIP model, including an image encoder and a text encoder, to compute the cosine similarity between text features and image features. Specifically, it can take a text prompt $t(s, d, c)=$ "a photo of a $(n)$ $\{s\}$ with $\{d\}$ artifacts, which is of $\{c\}$ quality" and an image as the inputs, and calculate the cosine similarity between text features and image features as the probabilities to represent how well that the text prompt describes the test image. Subsequently, the probabilities can be used to infer the scene type, artifact type, and quality level of the test image.
Therefore, we utilize the probabilities from different types of text prompts as the features to represent the scene, artifact, and quality-level characteristics of video frames. Here, we consider nine scene categories: $s \in S=$ \{"animal", "cityscape", "human", "indoor scene", "landscape", "night scene", "plant", "still-life", and "others"\}, eleven distortion types: $d \in D=\{$ "blur", "color-related", "contrast", "JPEG compression", "JPEG2000 compression", "noise", "overexposure", "quantization", "underexposure", "spatially-localized", and "others"\}, and five quality levels: $c \in C=\{1,2,3,4,5\}=\{$ "bad", "poor", "fair", "good", "perfect" $\}$. So, in total, we have 495 text prompt candidates to compute the probabilities:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}=\operatorname{LIQE}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, \boldsymbol{t}(\boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{d}, \boldsymbol{c})\right)\right) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}$ represents the LIQE features of $i$-th key frames, which comprises 495 dimensions corresponding to the scene category, artifact type, and quality level characteristics.

### 3.4. Q-Align Features

Q-Align is a large multi-modality model designed for quality assessment tasks. Specifically, Q-Align is pretrained on multiple large-scale image/video quality assessment databases. The quality labels of the databases are first transformed into qualitative adjective descriptions (excellent, good, fair, poor, bad) and are then integrated into question-answer pairs for instruction fine-tuning of Q-Align. After training, Q-Align operates by taking in the prompt of "How is the quality of this image? |img|

The quality of the image is [SCORE_TOKEN]", where [SCORE_TOKEN] is the quality rating token responded by Q-Align and [SCORE_TOKEN] can be translated into the $\log$ probabilities to the predefined qualitative adjective descriptions.

However, to form a more comprehensive quality representation from the $\mathrm{Q}$-Align perspective, we extract the feature map from the last hidden layer of Q-Align rather than [SCORE_TOKEN] for analysis, which can be derived as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q}-\mathrm{Align}}=\operatorname{GP}\left(\mathrm{Q}-\operatorname{Align}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\right)\right) \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q} \text {-Align }} \in R^{1 \times 4096}$ stands for the $\mathrm{Q}$-Align features of the $i$-th key frame, Q-Align $(\cdot)$ denotes the Q-Align last hidden layer feature map extraction process.

### 3.5. FAST-VQA Features

FAST-VQA is an efficient algorithm specially designed for BVQA. It notices that videos contain a high degree of spatio-temporal redundancy, and correspondingly proposes a grid mini-cude sampling (GMS) algorithm to pre-sample the video data before feeding them to the backbone, i.e. Video Swin Transformer Tiny (VSwin-T) [22] . For video as $\boldsymbol{x}$, the sampled fragments $\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{f}\right.$ ) are formulated as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left.\boldsymbol{x}_{i,\left[u \times S_{f}\right.}^{f}:(u+1) \times S_{f}, v \times S_{f}:(v+1) \times S_{f}\right]  \tag{7}\\
= & \left.\operatorname{RCrop}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i,\left[\frac{u \times H}{G_{f}}\right.}: \frac{(u+1) \times H}{G_{f}}, \frac{v \times W}{G_{f}}: \frac{(v+1) \times W}{G_{f}}\right], s_{f}\right) \tag{8}
\end{align*}
$$

The fragments are then fed into the VSwin-T to obtain the FAST-VQA features:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}=\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{f}\right) \tag{9}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this method, we extract FAST-VQA features pretrained from the LSVQ [59] database.

### 3.6. Quality Regression

After calculating these features, we concatenate these features into the final feature representation $\mathcal{F}_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathcal{F}_{i}=\operatorname{Cat}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}^{s}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{t}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{LIQE}}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{Q}-\mathrm{Align}}, \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}\right) \\
& \mathcal{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}}=\mathcal{F}^{\mathrm{FAST}-\mathrm{VQA}} \tag{10}
\end{align*}
$$

where Cat is the concatenation operator.

We then use a two-layer MLP network to regress $\mathcal{F}_{i}$ into local quality scores $\hat{q}_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{q}_{i}=\operatorname{MLP}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}\right) \tag{11}
\end{equation*}
$$

where MLP denotes the MLP operator and $\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ is the quality score of $i$-th frame/chunk. We use the average pooling method to derive the global quality score $\hat{q}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{q}=\frac{1}{N_{z}} \sum_{i=0}^{N_{z}-1} \hat{q}_{i} \tag{12}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.7. Loss Function

Similar to $[40,51]$, we use the PLCC loss to optimize the proposed BVQA model:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}=\left(1-\frac{\langle\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}-\operatorname{mean}(\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}), \boldsymbol{q}-\operatorname{mean}(\boldsymbol{q})\rangle}{\|\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}-\operatorname{mean}(\hat{\boldsymbol{q}})\|_{2}\|\boldsymbol{q}-\operatorname{mean}(\boldsymbol{q})\|_{2}}\right) / 2 \tag{13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}$ are the vectors of ground-truth and predicted quality scores of the images in a batch respectively, $\langle\cdot\rangle$ represents the inner product of two vectors, $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the norm operator for a vector, and mean is the average operator for a vector.

## 4. Experiment

### 4.1. Experimental Protocol

Test Datasets. We test our model on three VQA datasets: KVQ [24], TaoLive [64], and LIVE-WC [60], all of which focus on assessing the quality of streaming UGC videos. For KVQ, we train our model on the publicly released data from NTIRE 2024 Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge ${ }^{2}$ and subsequently test the trained model on both validation and test sets. For TaoLive and LIVEWC, we conduct random splits of the videos with an $80 \%$ - $20 \%$ train-test ratio based on the video scenes, and repeat this process five times and report the average performance.

Implementation Details. As stated in Section 3, we utilize Swin Transformer-B [21] and SlowFast R50 [6] as the backbones of the spatial and temporal quality analyzers in the basic model. To improve the generalization ability of the basic model, we first train it on the LSVQ dataset [59], following the training strategy in [40]. Regarding the spatial quality analyzer, we resize the resolution of the minimum dimension of key frames as 384 while preserving their aspect ratios. During the training and test stages, the key frames are randomly and centrally cropped with a resolution of $384 \times 384$. As for the temporal quality analyzer, the resolution of the video chunks is resized to $224 \times 224$ without respecting the aspect ratio. For LIQE, Q-Align, and FASTVQA, we adhere to the original setups of these methods without making any alterations to extract the corresponding features. The Adam optimizer with the initial learning rate $1 \times 10^{-5}$ and batch size 6 is used to train the proposed model on a server with 2 NVIDIA RTX 3090. We decay the learning rate by a factor of 10 after 10 epochs and the total number of epochs is set as 30 .

Compared Models. We compare the proposed method with eight typical BVQA methods, including four knowledge-driven methods: NIQE [30], TLVQM [12], VIDEVAL [43], and RAPIQUE [44], and four data-driven methods: VSFA [15], SimpleVQA [38], FAST-VQA [52],[^2]

and Q-Align [56]. Except for Q-Align, we train other BVQA models for fair comparison.

Evaluation Criteria. We employ two criteria to evaluate the performance of VQA models: PLCC and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC). Note that PLCC assesses the prediction linearity of the VQA model, while SRCC evaluates the prediction monotonicity. An outstanding VQA model should achieve SRCC and PLCC values close to 1 . Before computing PLCC, we adhere to the procedure outlined in [46] to map model predictions to MOSs by a monotonic four-parameter logistic function to compensate for prediction nonlinearity.

### 4.2. Experimental Results

We list the experimental results in Table 1, from which we can obtain several conclusions. First, it is evident that all knowledge-driven methods perform poorly on three social media VQA datasets, suggesting that they lack the capability to effectively evaluate the quality of social media videos. Second, the proposed model achieves the best performance on both the KVQ and LIVE-WC datasets, surpassing competing BVQA methods by a substantial margin. This demonstrates that by incorporating rich quality-aware features, the proposed model has more powerful feature rep-

| Base <br> Model | Q-Align | LIQE | FAST- <br> VQA | KVQ Test |  |

resentation capabilities for the complex BVQA task (e.g., BVQA for social media videos). Third, we observe that the proposed model achieves similar performance to SimpleVQA on TaoLive but outperforms other methods. The possible reason is that the videos in TaoLive mainly contain front-faces with diverse backgrounds. Moreover, the video processing method adopted in TaoLive only includes compression, which makes it simpler compared to the other two datasets. Therefore, even in the absence of diverse qualityaware features, SimpleVQA can still achieve state-of-theart performance, which also demonstrates the rationality of using SimpleVQA as the base model.

We also list the results of NTIRE Challenge in Table 2. To improve the robustness, we randomly split the public training set of KVQ with an $80 \%-20 \%$ ten times and use the ensemble results to compute the model performance. From Table 2, it is shown that the proposed model significantly outperforms other competing teams.

### 4.3. Ablation Studies

In this section, we investigate the effectiveness of features used in the proposed model. Specifically, we ablate Q-Align, LIQE, and FAST-VQA features from the proposed model respectively, and test them on the KVQ test set. The
experimental results are listed in Table 3. From Table 3, it is evident that regardless of which features are ablated, there is a performance degradation. When all features are integrated, the proposed model achieves the highest performance, which validates the effectiveness of extracted features.

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we attempt to enhance BVQA models with diverse quality-aware features and propose a strong BVQA model for social media videos. We use SimpleVQA as the base BVQA model and extract three kinds of qualityaware features from two BIQA models, LIQE and Q-Align, and one BVQA model, FAST-VQA. We simply concatenate these features with SimpleVQA and then regress them into the video quality score via a MLP network. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the best performance on three social media VQA datasets.
