#### Abstract

Quantum machine learning has the potential to computationally outperform classical machine learning, but it is not yet clear whether it will actually be valuable for practical problems. While some artificial scenarios have shown that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to their classical counterpart, it is unlikely that quantum machine learning will outclass traditional methods on popular classical datasets such as MNIST. In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may be the task where we can benefit from quantum methods. Therefore, it is important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4 to 20 qubits, and applied ten different ansätze with varying depths (ranging from 3 to 32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our dataset using real 4-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.


## I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum machine learning has attracted much attention in recent years as a promising application of quantum computers $[1,2]$. Many techniques, such as quantum neural networks $[3-5]$, quantum generative models $[6,7]$, quantum kernel methods [8], and so on have been developed for achieving possible quantum speedups in machine learning tasks. They have also been realized experimentally [7-11]. While some artificial, carefully-designed scenarios have demonstrated that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to classical methods [12-16], it is not yet clear whether quantum techniques would be beneficial for practical applications.

In traditional machine learning, standard datasets, such as MNIST handwritten digits [17], are used to evaluate the performance and thus the practicality of new models. However, it is rather unlikely that quantum machine learning methods can outperform the state-ofthe-art classical machine learning procedures on those datasets, looking at their recent great success. With a large-scale numerical experiment involving up to 30 qubits, Huang et al. [13] have shown that the FashionMNIST dataset [18] is better learned by classical models. In contrast, when working with "quantum data", such as quantum states or circuits, there is a good reason to be-[^0]

lieve that quantum computers may provide a significant advantage. In another work by Huang et al. [19], it has been rigorously shown that quantum machine learning is beneficial when learning unknown quantum states or processes provided from physical experiments. It is therefore important to develop a practical quantum dataset in which we can expect quantum methods to be superior.

Several works have made efforts in this direction. Schatski et al. [20] proposed a dataset consisting of parameterized quantum circuits with different structure whose parameters are optimized to give output states with certain values of entanglement. Also, Huang et al. [13] proposed to relabel a classical dataset by outputs of quantum circuits so that the relabeled one is difficult to be learned by classical computers. These examples, while giving datasets that are possibly hard to learn by classical computers, are not plausible "real-world" quantum data. Note that Perrier, Youssry and Ferrie [21] provides a quantum dataset called QDataSet, but its aim is to provide a benchmark for classical machine learning applied to quantum physics, and therefore it does not fit to the context of this paper.

In this work, we propose a more practical machine learning task that we expect to naturally arise in near future and in real-world: a clustering and classification of many quantum circuits, and provide an elementary dataset for this task. A successful model that can perform such a task could be beneficial to providers of cloud quantum computers; it would allow them to understand the preferences of their users by analyzing circuits submitted by them. While there are many possible ways to analyze the circuits, in this work, we focus on a setting

FIG. 1. Scenario of the proposed machine learning task. Cloud quantum computer providers get descriptions of quantum circuits constantly from their users and return execution results to them. The providers wish to investigate the user activities, e.g., whether two users are interested in solving a similar computational task or not, from the circuit data.

where the providers want to cluster or classify circuits based on their similarity of output states. This task is easy when we have access to quantum computers because similarity, which can be measured in terms of overlaps between output states, can be readily estimated on them. Such estimation is likely to be hard for classical computers when a quantum circuit is large enough.

The quantum dataset provided in this work is a set of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) [22, 23], which is an algorithm to find circuits that output approximate ground states of quantum systems. More specifically, we use six model Hamiltonians that are famous in condensed matter physics, and optimize 300 different parametrized circuits with varying structure and depth to output each of their ground states. The dataset includes circuits with up to 20 qubits, but it can be easily extended to larger numbers of qubits with access to quantum hardware. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using quantum circuit simulators and show that the circuits can be accurately clustered. We also demonstrate successful classification of our 4-qubit dataset using real quantum hardware.

The dataset is freely accessible on the GitHub repository [24], therefore the reader will be able to freely use it for research or benchmarking. For each number of qubit, data are stored in QASM [25] format and are publicly accessible. By providing a natural setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to support the thoughtful and grounded advancement of the field.

## II. DATASET CONSTRUCTION

## A. Idea overview

The machine learning task that we consider in this work is clustering and classification of quantum circuits based on the similarity of their output states. More specifically, the task is to classify $M$ quantum circuits $\left\{U_{m} \mid m=1,2, \cdots, M\right\}$ based on the fidelities of output states $\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2}$. We expect this task to naturally arise when quantum computer providers wish to analyze what their users do on their hardware. Also, we believe this task to be hard in general when we have access only to classical computers, since estimation of $|\langle 0|U| 0\rangle|^{2}$ to an accuracy of $\epsilon$ for a general polynomial-sized quantum circuit $U$ in polynomial time is clearly a BQP-complete task.

To construct an elementary dataset for this task, we use the VQE [22, 23]. It is a method to generate a quantum circuit which outputs an approximate ground state of a target Hamiltonian $H$. This is usually done by using a parameterized quantum circuit, also referred to as an ansatz, $U(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ whose parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is optimized to minimize the energy expectation value $\langle H(\boldsymbol{\theta})\rangle$ := $\left\langle 0\left|U^{\dagger}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) H U(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right| 0\right\rangle$. The dataset is constructed by optimizing various ansätze to generate ground states of different Hamiltonians $\left\{H_{l} \mid l=0,1, \cdots, L-1\right\}$ which have ground states $\left|g_{l}\right\rangle$ that are mutually almost orthogonal. Labeling each optimized ansatz $U_{m}$ based on the Hamiltonian to which it is optimized, we define a dataset $\left\{\left(U_{m}, l_{m}\right) \mid m=1,2, \cdots, M\right\}$ and $l_{m} \in\{0,1, \cdots, L-1\}$ as a set of pairs of a quantum circuit and its label.

We can expect this dataset to have a nice property that $\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2} \approx 1$ when $l_{m}=l_{m^{\prime}}$ and $\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2} \ll 1$ otherwise. Note that this property persists even if the optimization is imperfect. Suppose two quantum circuits $U_{1}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}\right)$ and $U_{2}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{2}\right)$ are respectively optimized to output non-degenerate ground states $\left|g_{l_{1}}\right\rangle$ and $\left|g_{l_{2}}\right\rangle$ of Hamiltonians $H_{l_{1}}$ and $H_{l_{2}}$. Moreover, let us assume the optimization is imperfect and $\left|\left\langle g_{l_{m}}\left|U_{m}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{m}\right)\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2}=\frac{3}{4}$ for $m=1,2$. When $H_{l_{1}}=H_{l_{2}},\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{1}^{\dagger}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}\right) U_{2}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{2}\right)\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2} \geq 1 / 4$. On the contrary, assuming $H_{l_{1}} \neq H_{l_{2}}$ and $\left\langle g_{l_{1}} \mid g_{l_{2}}\right\rangle=0$, $\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{1}^{\dagger}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}\right) U_{2}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{2}\right)\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2} \leq 1 / 16$. We expect this property makes it easier to extend the dataset by actual experiments using quantum hardware.

## B. Dataset construction details

Table I shows the overview of the dataset that we provide in this work. To define the $L=6$ dataset, we use the Hamiltonians in Table II. $X_{n}, Y_{n}$ and $Z_{n}$ $(n=1,2, \cdots, N)$ are respectively Pauli $X, Y$ and $Z$ operators acting on the $n$th qubit. $a_{i, \sigma}^{\dagger}$ and $a_{i, \sigma}$ is fermion creation and annihilation operators acting on the $i$ th site with the spin $\sigma$. For the Hubbard models, we map the Hamiltonians to qubit ones by Jordan-Wigner transformation; specifically, defining $\tilde{a}_{i}(i=1,2, \ldots, N)$ as $\tilde{a}_{2 j-1}=a_{j, \uparrow}$ and $\tilde{a}_{2 j}=a_{j, \downarrow}$ for $j=1,2, \ldots, N / 2$, we map them as,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{a}_{i} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(X_{i}+i Y_{i}\right) Z_{i-1} \cdots Z_{1} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

TABLE I. Overview of the dataset.

| Numbers of qubits | $N$ | $4,8,12,16,20$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Number of labels | $L$ | $6(5$ for $N=4)$ |
| Number of circuits for each | $M / L$ | 300 |
| label <br> Total number of circuits | $M$ | $1800(1500$ for $N=4)$ |

The sites of $2 \mathrm{D}$ Hubbard model are defined on $1 \times 2,2 \times 2$, $3 \times 2,4 \times 2$, and $5 \times 2$ square grids for $N=4,8,12,16$, and 20 respectively, and a $2 \mathrm{D}$ site index $\left(j_{x}, j_{y}\right)$ is mapped to the one-dimensional index $j$ as $j=2\left(j_{x}-1\right)+j_{y}$ for $j_{x}=1,2, \cdots, N / 4$ and $j_{y}=1,2$.

For ansätze, we use the ones listed in Table III. The one which we refer to as hardware-efficient ansatz has been a popular choice for the VQE ansatz to perform proof-of-principle demonstration of ideas [26-30]. The brick-block ansätze where we sequentially apply parameterized two-qubit gates are also a popular choice [31-34]. The last type of ansatz used in this work is Hamiltonian ansatz where we sequentially apply Pauli rotations $R_{\sigma}(\theta)=\exp (-i \theta \sigma / 2)$ for all Pauli operators $\sigma=X, Y, Z$ appearing in the problem Hamiltonian. This ansatz is physically motivated by the adiabatic evolution [35, 36]. For each ansatz, we vary the circuit depth $D$ from 3 to 32 so that we obtain 30 optimized circuits from each ansatz type. For each $D$, we sample initial parameters for optimization from the uniform distribution on $[-2 \pi, 2 \pi)$, except for Hamiltonian ansatz where we sample from $[0,0.1)$, for 10 times, and adopt the one which achieves the lowest energy expectation value after the optimization to the dataset. The optimization of parameters is performed by the BFGS method implemented on SciPy [37]. Using the exact expectation values without statistical noise computed by Qulacs [38], we optimize the parameters until the norm of gradient becomes less than $10^{-5}$ or the number of iterations exceeds 1000 .

## III. DATASET PROPERTIES

## A. Visualization of dataset

First, we visualize the constructed dataset using tstochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [39] to understand the distribution of data intuitively. t-SNE is a visualization method which takes a distance matrix $d_{m, m^{\prime}}$ of a dataset $\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\right\}$ consisting of high-dimensional vectors as its input, and generate low-dimensional points which maintain the similarities among the data points. Here, we adopt $d_{m, m^{\prime}}=1-\left|\left\langle 0\left|U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}\right| 0\right\rangle\right|^{2}$ as the distance matrix of our dataset consisting of quantum circuits $\left\{U_{m}\right\}$. We use the exact values for inner product of $\left\langle 0\left|U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}\right| 0\right\rangle$ calculated by Qulacs [38].

The visualization result is shown in Fig. 2 (top panels). Each point corresponds to a circuit $U_{m}$, and it is colored depending on its label. We observe that the $4-, 8-, 12$ - and 16-qubit datasets are well clustered, while a portion of the data from the 20 -qubit dataset appear to be somewhat intermingled. We find it harder to solve Hamiltonians corresponding to 20 qubits than the others for some ansatz employed in this work. We present in the Appendix the fidelity between the output state and the true ground state of the Hamiltonian for each ansatz. Another interesting feature is the existence of multiple clusters in a label. We believe this is an artificial effect caused by the t-SNE visualization. This feature cannot be observed by another visualization technique called multidimensional scaling (MDS) [40], which is shown in the Appendix.

Then, we perform clustering based on the exact value of $d_{i j}$ to show that the clustering of the proposed dataset is indeed easy for ideal quantum computers. We employ the k-medoids algorithm implemented in PyClustering [41]. The performance of the clustering is evaluated by adjusted Rand index (ARI) [42], which takes a value between 0 (random clustering) and 1 (perfect clustering). The ARI is evaluated as the mean of 10 trials of clustering with different random seeds.

The result is visualized in Fig. 2. The ARI of the 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-qubit dataset is respectively $0.992,0.968$, $0.927,0.883$ and 0.692 . The relatively low ARI for the 20-qubit dataset is caused by the difficulty of producing quantum circuits to output the ground state of label 5 . This result indicates that it is possible to cluster this dataset, even in the unsupervised setting, with an ideal quantum computer.

## B. Clustering using real quantum hardware and noise model simulator

Here, we show our 4-qubit dataset can be reliably learned by using real quantum computers that are presently available. To this end, we perform the clustering by running quantum circuits $U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}$ for all pairs of $m$ and $m^{\prime}$ on the ibmq_manila device available at IBMQ to get fidelity between the two output states. The number of measurements is set to $2 \times 10^{4}$ for each $U_{m}^{\dagger} U_{m^{\prime}}$. Only HE and 1D-BB ansätze with $D=3$ to 12 are used in the experiments, and thus the number of data is 10 for each ansatz.

In Fig. 3, we visualize the dataset by t-SNE using the distance matrix obtained from the experiment. As we can observe, we are able to perfectly cluster the dataset. This is because fidelities between the quantum states belonging to the same labels are maintained to be much larger than those with different labels even in a noisy environment. This result shows the actual quantum computers are capable of learning the dataset we propose.

To investigate the possibility of learning our 20 -qubit dataset on actual devices, we also perform clustering by running circuits on FakeAuckland backend available at IBMQ which is a simulator mimicking ibm_auckland device. The result is visualized in Fig. 3 in the same manner as the above experiment. The ARI is 0.720 . This

TABLE III. Ansätze used to generate the dataset. Angles in every rotation gates are treated as independent parameters of circuit. $R_{\sigma}$ is a rotation gate defined as $R_{\sigma}(\theta)=\exp (-i \theta \sigma / 2)$ for Pauli operators $\sigma \in\{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes N} . V_{n, n^{\prime}}$ is a four-parameter unitary gate defined as $V_{n, n^{\prime}}=\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}_{n, n^{\prime}}} R_{Y_{n}} R_{Y_{n^{\prime}}} \operatorname{CNOT}_{n, n^{\prime}} R_{Y_{n}} R_{Y_{n^{\prime}}}$, where $\operatorname{CNOT}_{n, n^{\prime}}$ is a NOT gate on the qubit $n^{\prime}$ controlled with the qubit $n$, which is taken from [31]. In addition, the following $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{S}}$ represent various ordered sets of pairs of sites for the 2-qubit gate. $\mathcal{P}_{\text {chain }}=\{(N-2 j-1, N-2 j) \mid j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2-1\} \cup\{(N-2 j, N-2 j+1) \mid j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2\}$, $\mathcal{P}_{\text {stair }}=\{(N-n, N-n+1) \mid n=1,2, \cdots, N-1\}, \mathcal{P}_{\text {complete }}=\left\{\left(N-n, N-n^{\prime}\right) \mid n^{\prime}=0,1, \cdots, n-1 ; n=1,2, \cdots, N-1\right\}$, $\mathcal{P}_{\text {ladder }}=\{(N-2 j-1, N-2 j+1) \mid j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2-1\} \cup\{(N-2 j, N-2 j+2) \mid j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2-1\} \cup\{(2 j-1,2 j) \mid$ $j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2\}, \mathcal{P}_{\text {cross-ladder }}=\mathcal{P}_{\text {ladder }} \cup\{(N-2 j, N-2 j+1),(N-2 j-1, N-2 j+2) \mid j=1,2, \cdots, N / 2-1\}$, where $N$ is the number of qubits.

indicates the possibility of learning our dataset using real devices even at the size of 20 qubits.

## C. Classical machine learning applied to the dataset

Our dataset is expected to be hard to be learned solely by classical computers. The most challenging part in applying classical machine learning algorithms is to find a good feature map to transform the description of a quantum circuit to e.g., a real-valued vector, which can then be processed by various techniques such as neural networks. After some trials, we find the task to be very non-trivial. Straight-forward applications of graph neural networks for the classification task of the proposed dataset, in an analogous way to Ref. [43], give us labels that are basically equivalent to random guessing.
To make the problem easier, we consider the task of classifying the dataset consisting of the same type of ansätze in a supervised setting. More concretely, we investigate the feasibility of classifying quantum circuits using the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ of the circuits as their features.

For this task, we employ kernel support vector machine (SVM) model [44]. To remove the difference in the lengths of the parameter vectors $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ depending on the different depths of the circuits, we extend $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ to match the deepest circuits within each ansatz type and fill the extended elements with zero. We split $80 \%$ of all data into training data and the rest into test data to ensure that the divided data has roughly the same proportions of different labels. We train the model 10 times with different splitting and report the mean accuracy score. The regularization strength, types of kernel, and the parameters in kernel are treated as hyperparameters and

optimized through the grid search technique combined with Stratified three-fold cross validation. We note that other classification methods such as random forest have given us similar results.

Figure 4 shows the classification accuracy. For Hamiltonian ansatz, we reached a higher classification accuracy of up to about $80 \%$ than other ansätze for all $n$. Such a high accuracy may be caused by the difference of quantum circuit structures from one label to another, which only exist in the case of the Hamiltonian ansatz. Except for the Hamiltonian ansatz, we only reached a classification accuracy of up to about $20 \%$ accuracy. This means that labels are predicted almost randomly. Although there may be a possible improvement to be made to this result by using more sophisticated methods such as neural networks, we can at least say "standard" classification models such as SVM do not work well on the proposed dataset even for the very simplified task; quantum computers are capable of solving the same task in an unsupervised setting with different ansätze.

## IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we proposed a quantum circuits classification problem as a more practical machine learning task. We introduced the dataset of $N=4,8,12,16,20$ qubit quantum circuits optimized by VQE for different Hamiltonians using different types of ansätze. We verified that the unsupervised clustering of the dataset is easy for ideal quantum computers. In 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-qubit cases, we achieved the ARI score of over 0.88 , and in 20 -qubit case, we achieved 0.69. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our 4-qubit subdataset using the actual 4 -qubit device.

Possible future directions are the followings. First, the capability to create the dataset by VQE implies that actual quantum devices can produce a dataset with even larger numbers of qubits. It is also interesting to explore whether other variational quantum algorithms or FTQC algorithms can also construct a dataset similar to the one provided in this work. Our dataset, which provides a set of practical quantum circuits optimized to output ground states, can also be useful as a benchmark for quantum circuit compilers/transpilers. The devices may be able to conduct similar experiments on our dataset of more numbers of qubits. We finally note that it is worth investigating whether state-of-the-art classical machine learning algorithms can solve the dataset. We published the dataset on GitHub [24].
