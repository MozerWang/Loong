#### Abstract

We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a selfdiscovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2's performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as $32 \%$ compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELFDISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than $20 \%$, while requiring $10-40 x$ fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.


## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023b; Anil et al., 2023) powered by transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have produced impressive breakthroughs in generating coherent texts (OpenAI, 2022), and following instructions (Zhong et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2022c; Wei et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). In pursuit of the goal to enhance LLMs' capability to reason and solve complex problems, various prompting methods have been proposed, drawing inspirations from cognitive theories of how humans rea-[^0]

For example, few-shot and zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Yasunaga et al., 2023) resembles how humans solve problems step-by-step, decomposition-based prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a; Drozdov et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023; Khot et al., 2022) is inspired by how humans breakdown a complex problem into a series of smaller subproblems, and then solve those subproblems one by one (Polya, 2004), and step-back prompting (Zheng et al., 2023) is motivated by how humans reflect on task nature to derive general principles. However, a fundamental limitation is that each technique itself serves as an atomic reasoning module making an implicit prior assumption of the process on how to tackle a given task. Instead, we argue that each task has a unique intrinsic structure underlying the reasoning process involved in solving it efficiently. For instance, least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a; Drozdov et al., 2022) has shown to be much more effective than CoT (Wei et al., 2022) at solving tasks such as symbolic manipulation and compositional generalization, due to the decomposition structure of the tasks.

This paper aims at self-discovering the underlying reasoning structure unique to each task, while being highly efficient in terms of computation. Our approach, SELF-DiscoVER, is inspired by how humans internally devise a reasoning program for problem-solving (Newell et al., 1958; Rasmussen, 1983), as illustrated in Figure 2 . From a set of atomic reasoning modules described in natural language such as "breakdown into sub tasks" and "critical thinking", an LLM, and task examples without labels, SELF-DisCOVER composes a coherent reasoning structure intrinsic to the task (Stage 1) and then solves instances of the task using the discovered structure (Stage 2). Stage 1 operates at the tasklevel and uses three actions to guide the LLM to generate a reasoning structure for the task. At Stage 2, during the final decoding, the LLM simply follows the self-discovered structure to arrive at the final answer.

Solving problems using SELF-DiscoVER brings several benefits compared to other methods for LLM reasoning. First, the discovered reasoning structure is grounded in atomic reasoning modules benefiting from the strengths of multiple reasoning modules in contrast to applying a priori module such as CoT. Second, SELF-DiscoVER is efficient

Self-Discover Over Chain-of-Thought

Figure 1. SELF-DISCOVER guides LLMs to self-discover and compose atomic reasoning modules into a reasoning structure to solve challenging tasks. Through testing on challenging reasoning benchmarks incuding Big Bench-Hard (BBH), agent reasoning (T4D), and MATH, we find that SELF-Discover outperforms Direct Answering on 23/25 and CoT on 21/25 tasks in zero-shot setting using PaLM 2-L. Full BBH results are in Appendix C Table 3.

in computation as it only requires 3 more inference steps on the task-level, while being more performant than inferenceheavy ensemble approaches such as self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022). Lastly, the discovered reasoning structure is intrinsic to the task, and conveys LLMs' insights about the task in a more interpretable way than the optimized prompts (Zhou et al., 2022b; Yang et al., 2023).

We test SELF-DiscoVER on 25 challenging reasoning tasks including Big Bench-Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022), Thinking for Doing (T4D) (Zhou et al., 2023) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021). SELF-DisCoVER outperforms CoT on 21/25 task with performance gains up to $42 \%$ (Figure 1), highlighting the advantage of the self-discovered reasoning structure composed from the atomic reasoning modules against a single a priori CoT module. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELF-DISCOVER achieves superior performance against inference-heavy methods such as CoT + Self-Consistency and majority voting of every module while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute (Figure 5). Finally, we compare SELF-DISCOVER with prompts optimized (OPRO) using a training set (Yang et al., 2023) (Figure 9). We find that SELF-DiscoVER still performs on par or better than OPRO while the self-discovered reasoning structure are much more interpretable.

We conduct a set of analysis to understand the effectiveness of SELF-DiscoVER. By breaking down BBH tasks into 4 different categories, we find that SELF-DISCOVER performs best on tasks requiring world knowledge and has a moderate performance boost on algorithmic tasks compared to CoT (Figure 4). This is further confirmed by the error analysis on MATH, where $74.7 \%$ model failures comes from computation errors (e.g. math). We also take a closer look at the self-discovered reasoning structures, and show the universality of them by transferability study from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama-2-70B. We hope to encourage more future work on structured reasoning for solving challenging problems using LLMs.

## 2. Self-Discovering Reasoning Structures for Problem-Solving

We take inspiration from how humans use prior knowledge and skills to devise a reasoning program to solve problems (Newell et al., 1958; Rasmussen, 1983). When we face a new problem, we often first search internally what knowledge and skills from our prior experience might be helpful to solve it. Then we will attempt to apply relevant knowledge and skills to this task. And finally we will connect multiple individual skills and knowledge to solve the problem. We design SELF-DiscoVER to enact these steps into two stages as illustrated in Figure 2.

Given a task and a set of reasoning module descriptions representing high-level problem-solving heuristics such as "Use critical thinking" and "Let's think step by step", Stage 1 of SELF-DISCOVER aims to uncover the intrinsic reasoning structure for solving this task via meta-reasoning. Specifically, we uses three meta-prompts to guide LLMs to select, adapt, and implement an actionable reasoning structure with no labels or training required. We format the structure in key-value pairs similar to JSON due to interpretability and findings on following JSON boosts reasoning and generation quality (Zhou et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023a). The structure of

Figure 2. Illustration of using SELF-Discover for problem-solving. Given a generative LM, task, and seed reasoning module descriptions, we guide LMs to generate a reasoning structure in key-value format to solve the task. Finally, models can follow the self-discovered structures to solve the every instance from the task by filling in the values in JSON step-by-step.

the meta-prompts and full prompts are shown in Appendix. Stage 1 operates on task-level, meaning we only need to run SELF-DISCOVER once for each task. Then, in Stage 2, we can simply use the discovered reasoning structure to solve every instance of the given task by instructing models to follow the provided structure by filling each key and arrive at a final answer.

### 2.1. Stage 1: Self-Discover Task-Specific Structures

The first stage consists of three actions: 1) SELECT, where relevant reasoning modules for task-solving are chosen from the set of reasoning module descriptions; 2) ADAPT, where descriptions of selected reasoning modules are rephrased to be more specific to the task at hand; and 3) IMPLEMENT, where the adapted reasoning descriptions are implemented into a structured actionable plan so that the task can be solved by following the structure.

SELECT First, not every reasoning module is helpful for every task, so the first stage of SELF-Discover guides model to select modules that are useful based on task examples. For example, "reflective thinking" might help search for first-principle theories on science problems, while "creative thinking" helps on generating a novel continuation to a story. Given raw set of reasoning module descriptions $D$ such as "critical thinking", and "break the problem into sub-problems" (full set in Appendix A), and a few task examples without labels $t_{i} \in T$, SELF-DISCOVER first selects a subset of reasoning modules $D_{S}$ that are useful for solving the tasks by using a model $\mathcal{M}$ and a meta-prompt $p_{S}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{S}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{S}\|D\| t_{i}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

ADAPT Since each reasoning module provides a general description of how to solve problems, the next step of SELFDISCOVER aims at tailoring each selected module to the task at hand. For example, from "break the problem into subproblems" to "calculate each arithmetic operation in order" for arithmetic problems. Given selected reasoning module subset $D_{S}$ from the previous step, ADAPT rephrases each of the selected module to be more specific to the task. Similarly to SELECT, this stage uses a meta-prompt $p_{A}$ and a generative model $\mathcal{M}$ to generate the adapted reasoning module descriptions $D_{A}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{A}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{A}\left\|D_{S}\right\| t_{i}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

IMPLEMENT Finally, given the adapted reasoning module descriptions $D_{A}$, SELF-DisCoVER operationalizes the reasoning modules into an implemented reasoning structure $D_{I}$ with specified instruction on what to generate for each step. In addition to a meta prompt $p_{I}$, IMPLEMENT also provides a demonstration of a human-written reasoning structure $S_{\text {human }}$ on another task to better convert the natural language descriptions into a reasoning structure:

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{I}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{A}\left\|S_{\text {human }}\right\| D_{A} \| t_{i}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 2.2. Stage 2: Tackle Tasks Using Discovered Structures

After the three stages, we have an implemented reasoning structure $D_{I}$ uniquely adapted for the task we need to solve $T$. Then we can simply append the reasoning structure to all instances of the task and prompt models to follow the reasoning structure to generate an answer $A$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\mathcal{M}\left(D_{S} \| t\right), \forall t \in T \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

More details of prompts are included in Appendix A.

## 3. Experiment Setup

### 3.1. Tasks

We focus on diverse reasoning benchmarks that are still challenging for LLMs: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_9f5d16f781ade6059c66g-04.jpg?height=656&width=1510&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=275)

Figure 3. Illustration of three actions of SELF-DISCOVER. We use LMs to compose a coherent reasoning structure by selecting relevant modules, adapting to task-specific descriptions, and implement a reasoning structure in JSON.

et al., 2022) contains 23 carefully-selected challenging tasks from BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2023). BBH tasks cover a diverse range of reasoning problems spanning the following 4 categories according to their authors: 1) Algorithmic and Multi-Step Arithmetic Reasoning, 2) Natural Language Understanding, 3) Use of World Knowledge, and 4) Multilingual Knowledge and Reasoning. We also test on a grounded social agent reasoning task called Thinking for Doing (T4D) where models must leverage mental state reasoning to determine actions to perform (Zhou et al., 2023), where GPT-4 with CoT only reaches around $50 \%$. Finally, we subsample 200 examples from the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) test set, and generate instance-level reasoning structures via a one-shot demonstration to adapt to the complexity of MATH tasks. For evaluations, we use accuracy to measure the model performance on BBH, T4D and MATH (details can be found in Appendix B).

### 3.2. Models

We use several state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 (gpt-4-turbopreview) (OpenAI, 2023b), GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) (OpenAI, 2022) ${ }^{1}$, instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023) ${ }^{2}$, and an open-source LLM Llama2-70B (Touvron et al., 2023).

### 3.3. Baselines

We compare SELF-DISCOVER with other zero-shot prompting methods for LLM reasoning:[^1]- Direct Prompting, where model directly generates the answer without intermediate reasoning steps.
- CoT (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022), where models are prompted to generate a reasoning process leading to the final answer.
- Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023), where models are prompted to first generate a plan and then solve the problem. SELF-DISCOVER differs by grounding the reasoning structure in atomic reasoning modules, and prompting the decoding to follow the explicit key-value reasoning structure.

Next, we also consider other baselines that make use of the raw seed reasoning modules (RM) we pass to SELFDISCOVER. We compare with the following methods' performance and the inference call efficiency on a subset of tasks.

- CoT-Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022), we sample multiple outputs from LLM with CoT and aggregate answers to get the final answer. We compare this method on a subset of tasks due to the cost of repetitive queries.
- Majority voting of each RM: we prompt models to solve the tasks by appending each RM and use majority voting of all answers to get the final answer. We examine whether integrating multiple RMs into a coherent reasoning structure is advantageous to applying each RM to solve the task and use majority voting to ensemble them post-hoc, which costs much more inference computation.
- Best of each RM: this method assumes that we have access to oracle labels and uses the highest accuracy from

applying each RM. We compare with this to examine whether SELF-DISCOVER competes with methods that depend on perfect prior knowledge of which RM to use on a new task.

Furthermore, for analysis on universality of reasoning structures, we compare with a prompt-optimization method that require a training set to improve prompts: LLMs as optimizers (OPRO) (Yang et al., 2023). We aim to show that when we apply structures or prompts optimized from one model, the reasoning structures can retain more performance gains than the wordings of prompts.

## 4. Results

We answer the following questions through experimental results: 1) Does discovering reasoning structures improve LLM reasoning capabilities? (4.1) 2) Which categories of problems do SELF-DISCOVER perform the best? (4.2) and 3) Can SELF-Discover boost LLM performance efficiently? (4.3) Finally, we will show qualitative examples of self-discovered structures, LLM output following the structures, and compare with LLM output following other prompting methods for reasoning (4.4).

### 4.1. Does SELF-Discover Improve LLM Reasoning?

Overall, SELF-DISCOVER improves PaLM 2-L and GPT4's reasoning across diverse set of reasoning tasks. Table 1 shows the overall results on complex reasoning tasks of BBH, T4D and MATH using PaLM 2-L and GPT-4. We compare Self-Discover with baselines including direct prompting, CoT, and Plan-and-Solve (PS).

On aggregated 23 tasks of BBH, SELF-DISCOVER achieves $7 \%$ and 6\% absolute improvement on PaLM 2-L over Chainof-Thought and Plan-and-Solve, respectively. Similar gains ( $6 \%$ and $8 \%$ ) are observed when SELF-DISCOVER is applied to GPT-4. Breakdown results of each task's improvement

Figure 4. Breakdown of SElf-Discover performance improvement on 4 categories on PaLM 2-L. SELF-Discover performs the best on tasks requiring world knowledge.

over direct answering and CoT of PaLM 2-L are shown in Figure 1, where we find SELF-DISCOVER outperforms them on over 20/24 tasks. For a per-task performance for all 23 BBH tasks, please refer to Appendix C.

On the grounded social agent task T4D, SElFDISCOVER reaches over $\geq 27 \%$ (32\%) absolute improvement over all baselines on PaLM 2-L (GPT-4). SELF-DISCOVER achieves $69 \%$ and $85 \%$ accuracy on PaLM 2-L and GPT-4, significantly outperforming previous SoTA prompting method such as Foresee and Reflect (FaR) which employs an expert-designed reasoning structure. In contrast, Self-Discover generates the reasoning structure automatically from a set of atomic reasoning modules without human interventions.

For MATH, we observe a moderate gain of $1 \%-7 \%(2 \%-3 \%)$ on PaLM 2-L (GPT-4) from SELF-DISCOVER compared to the baselines. Upon error analysis (see Appendix D for details), we find that the reasoning structures generated by PaLM 2-L from SELF-DISCOVER are correct $87.5 \%$ of the time: human experts can follow the reasoning structures to solve the tasks perfectly. The majority of the failures ( $74.7 \%$ ) comes from errors in executing the computations, consistent with prior findings (Zheng et al., 2023).

### 4.2. Which Types of Problems Do Self-Discover Help the Most?

SELF-DISCOVER performs best on tasks that require diverse world knowledge. Figure 4 presents the average improvement in terms of delta in accuracy of SELFDISCOVER over direct answer and CoT on 4 categories of reasoning tasks we test. We adopt the categorization from Suzgun et al. (2022). We find that SelfDISCOVER improves over these two baselines on all categories, but especially on tasks that require world knowledge such as sports understanding, movie recommendation, and ruin names.

These tasks demand models to reason using fact and general

SELF-DisCover requires only 1 inference call per instance (plus 3 more meta-prompts on the task-level), same as Direct and CoT while reaching better performance compared with $40 \mathrm{x}$ more call required methods (majority voting of each RM) on GPT-4. We acknowledge that SELF-DISCOVER input and output are longer than CoT and Direct prompting, increasing cost. However, as the number of instances increases, the efficiency of SELF-DISCOVER in terms of inference per instance is highly desirable.

commonsense knowledge. We interpret SELF-DISCOVER's advantages on these tasks as strength from integrating multiple reasoning modules from various perspectives as only applying CoT might miss key knowledge in the reasoning process. We observe that the gain on the Algorithmic category is moderate, consistent with the findings from Sec. 4.1 on MATH.

### 4.3. How Efficient is SELF-DISCOVER?

SELF-DISCOVER achieves better performance while requiring 10-40x fewer inference computer compared to self-consistency or majority voting. Here we examine a subset of 2 tasks from BBH and present a more thorough comparison of methods including those requiring many inference calls that are too costly to run on all 24 tasks. Figure 5 shows average accuracy and number of inference calls required per instance for each method using GPT-4. Accuracy wise (y-axis), we find that SELFDISCOVER outperforms other baselines even those that require repeated inference calls such as CoT-self-consistency and majority voting of applying each RM. Efficiency wise (x-axis), SELF-DISCOVER only requires one call per instance and three more inference calls on the task-level, CoTself-consistency requires 10 times more since we have to sample 10 times for each instance, and methods using each RM requires 40 times more as we use 40 RMs. In summary, SELF-DISCOVER presents itself a strong reasoning boosting method that is efficient to deploy on large-scale.

### 4.4. Qualitative Examples

We show examples of model-discovered structures for different reasoning tasks in Figure 6 from PaLM 2-L. We observe that each structure is uniquely adapted to the task, integrates

Figure 6. Examples of self-discovered structures on BBH tasks using PaLM 2-L. We observe traits of atomic reasoning modules such as "Step-by-step thinking", "reflect on task nature", and an interesting creative thinking case where models devise an algorithm using stack to solve parenthesis parsing task.

multiple reasoning modules, and provides insights on how to solve the tasks. Furthermore, example of comparing reasoning processes from CoT, Plan-and-Solve, and SElFDisCOVER is shown in Figure 7. We find that CoT and Plan-and-Solve makes incorrect assertions early and arrives at a wrong answer while following structure from SELFDISCOVER leads the model to generate logical conclusions ("path is closed as the beginning and ending coordinates are the same") and arrive at the correct answer.

## 5. Deep Diving Into Self-Discovered Reasoning Structures

After experimental results showing the effectiveness and efficiency of SELF-DISCOVER on a range of reasoning

Figure 7. Comparison of generated reasoning process from CoT, Plan-and-Solve, and SELF-DisCOVER on BBH-geometric shape task. Both CoT and Plan-and-Solve incorrectly asserts that the path does not form a regular shape as it is not a closed path (highlighted in red) and arrive at a wrong answer. The reasoning structure (in blue Courier font) from SELF-DISCOVER first breaks down each line segment and analyze the coordinates carefully, then leverages logical reasoning to conclude that it forms a closed shape as the path ends at the same coordinate (highlighted in purple and orange), and selects the correct answer through final reasoning.

tasks, this section further analyzes are all actions of SELFDISCOVER needed and what other benefits can selfdiscovered structures bring? In Sec. 5.1 , we show that it is critical to the model's performance to use the reasoning structures discovered through the three steps of SELECT, ADAPT and IMPLEMENT. In Sec. 5.2, we demonstrate the universality of the self-discovered reasoning structures by (1) applying the structures discovered by PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, (2) applying the structures discovered by GPT-4 to Llama-2-70B. We further show the commonalities between the reasoning structures and human reasoning patterns in Appendix E.

### 5.1. Importance of SELF-DISCOVER Actions

We conduct ablation study on the three actions: SELECT, ADAPT, and IMPLEMENT to analyze the effects of SELFDISCOVER actions. Figure 8 show results using GPT-4 on 4 reasoning tasks when we apply SELECT (-S) or apply SELECT and ADAPT (-SA) or apply all three actions. We find that with each stage, model's zero-shot reasoning capability improve consistently across tasks, indicating that all three actions are beneficial. In particular, after all three actions SAI, the reasoning structures are adapted to be task specific, and bring the most gain to solving the reasoning tasks.

Figure 8. Ablation study on three SELF-DISCOVER actions on 4 reasoning tasks: all three actions are beneficial for task-solving.

### 5.2. Towards Universality of Discovered Reasoning Structures

Applying PaLM 2-L Discovered Structures to GPT-4 We first use a PaLM 2-L model to discover the reasoning structures of 4 reasoning tasks. Then, we apply the resulting reasoning structures to the decoding of GPT-4 as grounding. We compare our approach to OPRO (Yang et al., 2023) which discovered zero-shot-prompts through optimizations. We apply OPRO prompts optimized using PaLM 2-L on each task to GPT-4 on the same reasoning tasks. Figure 9 shows that SELF-DISCOVER outperforms OPRO on 3 out of 4 tasks despite that OPRO used $20 \%$ data to optimize the

Figure 9. Transferrability tests of optimized prompts (OPRO) and composed structures (SELF-DISCOVER). The results shown are from GPT-4 using the prompts and structures optimized or composed using PaLM 2-L. We find that self-discovered reasoning structure transfers more robustly than optimized prompts. prompt. In contrast, SELF-DISCOVER is done in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating the efficiency of our method and universality of the discovered reasoning structures.

## Applying GPT-4 Discovered Structures to Llama2 and

 ChatGPT Motivated by transferrability performance across LLMs, we further investigate can self-discovered reasoning structures from LLMs boost reasoning for smaller $L M s$ that are challenging to come up with structures themselves ${ }^{3}$. We use GPT-4 to discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures, and then apply those structures to the decoding of open-sourced Llama2-70B as well as GPT-3.5turbo (ChatGPT) on two subsets of tasks from BBH. We find that using self-discovered structures on Llama2 (52\%) outperforms CoT (42\%) on disambiguation QA zero-shot and on GPT-3.5-turbo (56\%) outperforms CoT (51\%) on geometry with 3 -shot demonstration from structured reasoning process.

Recent advancements in the area of LLMs have given rise to a plethora of few-shot (Brown et al., 2020) and instruction (Mishra et al., 2022c; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) prompting techniques, including Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022), Leastto-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a; Drozdov et al., 2022), Decomposed prompting (Khot et al., 2022), Reframing (Mishra et al., 2022b), Help Me Think Prompting (Mishra \& Nouri, 2023), Stepback Prompting (Zheng et al., 2023) and search-based approaches like Tree-ofThought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023a), Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023b), Branch-solve-merge (Saha et al., 2023) and RAP (Hao et al., 2023). Each of the[^2]

prompting methods has some strengths and weaknesses in terms of their successful application domain. Our work SELF-DISCOVER presents the missing piece in the prompting literature, as SELF-DISCOVER provides a way to selfcompose over various prompting methods via the proposed self-discovery mechanism. Composing over prompting methods in SELF-DISCOVER is analogous to the programming literature where a program is written using various basic building blocks such as for loop, if/else condition etc.

### 6.2. Reasoning and Planning

With the development of various reasoning and planning benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), Math (Hendrycks et al.), BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2023) etc., various methods have been proposed to improve model performance. Often these methods induce specific reasoning structures mimicking the reasoning structure of the underlying task associated with the dataset. For example, chain of thought (Wei et al., 2022) and scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021) induce generation of explanations associated with a reasoning question. Similarly other methods induces specific reasoning structures such as question summarization (Kuznia et al., 2022), question decomposition (Patel et al., 2022), program generation (Mishra et al., 2022a; Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023b), etc. However, in a real world user traffic, queries can be diverse covering various reasoning structures. Our work SELF-Discover allows models to combine multiple reasoning approaches by selfcomposing into a structure without the need to access task labels. There have been some related work that explores LLM combining skills in-context such as SkiC (Chen et al., 2023), devising a strategy (Gao et al., 2023a), and planning with iterative quering (Liu et al., 2023). However, they require human annotating skills and reasoning plans while SELF-DISCOVER leverages a scalable solution with the help of LLM's meta-task reasoning capabilities.

## 7. Conclusion

We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, an efficient and performant framework for models to self-discover a reasoning structure for any task from a seed set of general problem-solving skills. We observe drastic improvements on challenging reasoning benchmarks from multiple LLMs up to $30 \%$. Ablations study of SELF-DISCOVER demonstrates that the composed reasoning structures are universally transferable between LLMs. Forward looking, we are excited to explore more on LLM structured reasoning to push the boundary of problem-solving and discover potentials for Human-AI collaboration.
