#### Abstract

Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to enhance and replicate human workflows. In real-world applications, however, existing systems (Park et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023) tend to oversimplify the complexities. They struggle to achieve effective, coherent, and accurate problem-solving processes, particularly when there is a need for meaningful collaborative interaction (Zhang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023).

Through extensive collaborative practice, humans have developed widely accepted Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) across various domains (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; DeMarco \& Lister, 2013). These SOPs play a critical role in supporting task decomposition and effective coordination. Furthermore, SOPs outline the responsibilities of each team member, while establishing standards for intermediate outputs. Well-defined SOPs improve the consistent and accurate execution of tasks that align with defined roles and quality standards (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; DeMarco \& Lister, 2013; Wooldridge \& Jennings, 1998). For instance, in a software company, Product Managers analyze competition and user needs to create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) using a standardized structure, to guide the developmental process.

Inspired by such ideas, we design a promising GPT-based Meta-Programming framework called MetaGPT that significantly benefits from SOPs. Unlike other works (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023), MetaGPT requires agents to generate structured outputs, such as high-quality requirements[^0]

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_b80429f8a3ec63293952g-02.jpg?height=662&width=1374&top_left_y=295&top_left_x=381)

Figure 1: The software development SOPs between MetaGPT and real-world human teams. In software engineering, SOPs promote collaboration among various roles. MetaGPT showcases its ability to decompose complex tasks into specific actionable procedures assigned to various roles (e.g., Product Manager, Architect, Engineer, etc.).

documents, design artifacts, flowcharts, and interface specifications. The use of intermediate structured outputs significantly increases the success rate of target code generation. More graphically, in a company simulated by MetaGPT, all employees follow a strict and streamlined workflow, and all their handovers must comply with certain established standards. This reduces the risk of hallucinations caused by idle chatter between LLMs, particularly in role-playing frameworks, like: "Hi, hello and how are you?" - Alice (Product Manager); "Great! Have you had lunch?" - Bob (Architect).

Benefiting from SOPs, MetaGPT offers a promising approach to meta-programming. In this context, we adopt meta-programming ${ }^{1}$ as "programming to program", in contrast to the broader fields of meta learning and "learning to learn" (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1993a; Hochreiter et al., 2001; Schmidhuber, 2006; Finn et al., 2017).

This notion of meta-programming also encompasses earlier efforts like CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) and recent projects such as CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023) and WizardCoder (Luo et al., 2023). However, MetaGPT stands out as a unique solution that allows for efficient metaprogramming through a well-organized group of specialized agents. Each agent has a specific role and expertise, following some established standards. This allows for automatic requirement analysis, system design, code generation, modification, execution, and debugging during runtime, highlighting how agent-based techniques can enhance meta-programming.

To validate the design of MetaGPT, we use publicly available HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) for evaluations. Notably, in code generation benchmarks, MetaGPT achieves a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) with $85.9 \%$ and $87.7 \%$ in Pass @ 1. When compared to other popular frameworks for creating complex software projects, such as AutoGPT (Torantulino et al., 2023), LangChain (Chase, 2022), AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023). MetaGPT also stands out in handling higher levels of software complexity and offering extensive functionality. Remarkably, in our experimental evaluations, MetaGPT achieves a $100 \%$ task completion rate, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency (time and token costs) of our design.

We summarize our contributions as follows:

- We introduce MetaGPT, a meta-programming framework for multi-agent collaboration based on LLMs. It is highly convenient and flexible, with well-defined functions like role definition and message sharing, making it a useful platform for developing LLM-based multi-agent systems.[^1]
- Our innovative integration of human-like SOPs throughout MetaGPT's design significantly enhances its robustness, reducing unproductive collaboration among LLM-based agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel executive feedback mechanism that debugs and executes code during runtime, significantly elevating code generation quality (e.g., $5.4 \%$ absolute improvement on MBPP).
- We achieve state-of-the-art performance on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021). Extensive results convincingly validate MetaGPT, suggesting that it is a promising meta-programming framework for developing LLM-based multi-agent systems.


## 2 RELATED WORK

Automatic Programming The roots of automatic programming reach back deep into the previous century. In 1969, Waldinger \& Lee (1969) introduced "PROW," a system designed to accept program specifications written in predicate calculus, generate algorithms, and create LISP implementations (McCarthy, 1978). Balzer (1985) and Soloway (1986) made efforts to advance automatic programming and identified potential methods to achieve it. Recent approaches use natural language processing (NLP) techniques (Ni et al., 2023; Skreta et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2018; 2021b; Zhang et al., 2023). Automatic programming has grown into an industry delivering paid functions such as Microsoft Copilot. Lately, LLMs-based agents (Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) have advanced automatic programming development. Among them, ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) utilize a chain of thought prompts (Wei et al., 2022) to generate reasoning trajectories and action plans with LLMs. Both works demonstrate the effectiveness of the ReAct style loop of reasoning as a design paradigm for empowering automatic programming. Additionally, ToolFormer (Schick et al., 2023) can learn how to use external tools through simple APIs. The research most closely aligned with our work by Li et al. (2023) proposes a straightforward role-play framework for programming that involves communication between agents playing different roles. Qian et al. (2023) utilizes multiple agents for software development. Although existing papers (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023) have improved productivity, they have not fully tapped into effective workflows with structured output formats. This makes it harder to deal with complex software engineering issues.

LLM-Based Multi-Agent Frameworks Recently, LLM-based autonomous agents have gained tremendous interest in both industry and academia (Wang et al., 2023b).

Many works (Wang et al., 2023c; Du et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023; Akata et al., 2023) have improved the problem-solving abilities of LLMs by integrating discussions among multiple agents. Stable-Alignment (Liu et al., 2023) creates instruction datasets by deriving consensus on value judgments through interactions across a sandbox with LLM agents. Other works focus on sociological phenomena. For example, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) creates a "town" of 25 agents to study language interaction, social understanding, and collective memory. In the Natural Language-Based Society of Mind (NLSOM) (Zhuge et al., 2023), agents with different functions interact to solve complex tasks through multiple rounds of "mindstorms." Cai et al. (2023) propose a model for cost reduction by combining large models as tool makers and small models as tool users.

Some works emphasize cooperation and competition related to planning and strategy (Bakhtin et al., 2022); others propose LLM-based economies (Zhuge et al., 2023). In our implementations, we observe several challenges to multi-agent cooperation, such as maintaining consistency and avoiding unproductive cycles. This motivates our focus on applying advanced concepts such as Standard Operating Procedures in software development to multi-agent frameworks.

## 3 METAGPT: A META-PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK

MetaGPT is a meta-programming framework for LLM-based multi-agent systems. Sec. 3.1 provides an explanation of role specialization, workflow and structured communication in this framework, and illustrates how to organize a multi-agent system within the context of SOPs. Sec. 3.2 presents a communication protocol that enhances role communication efficiency. We also implement structured communication interfaces and an effective publish-subscribe mechanism. These methods enable agents to obtain directional information from other roles and public information

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_b80429f8a3ec63293952g-04.jpg?height=697&width=1388&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=366)

Figure 2: An example of the communication protocol (left) and iterative programming with executable feedback (right). Left: Agents use a shared message pool to publish structured messages. They can also subscribe to relevant messages based on their profiles. Right: After generating the initial code, the Engineer agent runs and checks for errors. If errors occur, the agent checks past messages stored in memory and compares them with the PRD, system design, and code files.

from the environment. Finally, we introduce executable feedback-a self-correction mechanism for further enhancing code generation quality during run-time in Sec. 3.3.

### 3.1 AGENTS IN StANDARd OPERATING ProcedUReS

Specialization of Roles Unambiguous role specialization enables the breakdown of complex work into smaller and more specific tasks. Solving complex tasks or problems often requires the collaboration of agents with diverse skills and expertise, each contributing specialized outputs tailored to specific issues.

In a software company, a Product Manager typically conducts business-oriented analysis and derives insights, while a software engineer is responsible for programming. We define five roles in our software company: Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, and QA Engineer, as shown in Figure 1. In MetaGPT, we specify the agent's profile, which includes their name, profile, goal, and constraints for each role. We also initialize the specific context and skills for each role. For instance, a Product Manager can use web search tools, while an Engineer can execute code, as shown in Figure 2. All agents adhere to the React-style behavior as described in Yao et al. (2022).

Every agent monitors the environment (i.e., the message pool in MetaGPT) to spot important observations (e.g.,, messages from other agents). These messages can either directly trigger actions or assist in finishing the job.

Workflow across Agents By defining the agents' roles and operational skills, we can establish basic workflows. In our work, we follow SOP in software development, which enables all agents to work in a sequential manner.

Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, upon obtaining user requirements, the Product Manager undertakes a thorough analysis, formulating a detailed PRD that includes User Stories and Requirement Pool. This serves as a preliminary functional breakdown. The structured PRD is then passed to the Architect, who translates the requirements into system design components, such as File Lists, Data Structures, and Interface Definitions. Once captured in the system design, the information is directed towards the Project Manager for task distribution. Engineers proceed to execute the designated classes and functions as outlined (detailed in Figure 2). In the following stage, the QA Engineer formulates test cases to enforce stringent code quality. In the final step, MetaGPT pro-

duces a meticulously crafted software solution. We provide a detailed schematic (Figure 3) and a concrete instance (Appendix B) of the SOP workflow in MetaGPT.

### 3.2 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

Structured Communication Interfaces Most current LLM-based multi-agent frameworks ( $\mathrm{Li}$ et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023) utilize unconstrained natural language as a communication interface.

However, despite the versatility of natural language, a question arises: does pure natural language communication suffice for solving complex tasks? For example, in the telephone game (or Chinese whispers $)^{2}$, after several rounds of communication, the original information may be quite distorted. Inspired by human social structures, we propose using structured communication to formulate the communication of agents. We establish a schema and format for each role and request that individuals provide the necessary outputs based on their specific role and context.

As shown in Figure 3, the Architect agent generates two outputs: the system interface design and a sequence flow diagram. These contain system module design and interaction sequences, which serve as important deliverables for Engineers. Unlike ChatDev (Zhao et al., 2023), agents in MetaGPT[^2]communicate through documents and diagrams (structured outputs) rather than dialogue. These documents contain all necessary information, preventing irrelevant or missing content.

Publish-Subscribe Mechanism Sharing information is critical in collaboration. For instance, Architects and Engineers often need to reference PRDs. However, communicating this information each time in a one-to-one manner, as indicated by previous work (Li et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), can complicate the communication topology, resulting in inefficiencies.

To address this challenge, a viable approach is to store information in a global message pool. As shown in Figure 2 (left), we introduce a shared message pool that allows all agents to exchange messages directly. These agents not only publish their structured messages in the pool but also access messages from other entities transparently. Any agent can directly retrieve required information from the shared pool, eliminating the need to inquire about other agents and await their responses. This enhances communication efficiency.

Sharing all information with every agent can lead to information overload. During task execution, an agent typically prefers to receive only task-related information and avoid distractions through irrelevant details. Effective management and dissemination of this information play a crucial role. We offer a simple and effective solution-subscription mechanism (in Figure 2 (left)). Instead of relying on dialogue, agents utilize role-specific interests to extract relevant information. They can select information to follow based on their role profiles. In practical implementations, an agent activates its action only after receiving all its prerequisite dependencies. As illustrated in Figure 3, the Architect mainly focuses on PRDs provided by the Product Manager, while documents from roles such as the QA Engineer might be of lesser concern.

### 3.3 ITERATIVE PROGRAMMING WITH EXECUTABLE FEEDBACK

In daily programming tasks, the processes of debugging and optimization play important roles. However, existing methods often lack a self-correction mechanism, which leads to unsuccessful code generation. Previous work introduced non-executable code review and self-reflection (Zhao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). However, they still face challenges in ensuring code executability and runtime correctness.

Our first MetaGPT implementations overlooked certain errors during the review process, due to LLM hallucinations (Manakul et al., 2023). To overcome this, after initial code generation, we introduce an executable feedback mechanism to improve the code iteratively. More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, the Engineer is asked to write code based on the original product requirements and design.

This enables the Engineer to continuously improve code using its own historical execution and debugging memory. To obtain additional information, the Engineer writes and executes the corresponding unit test cases, and subsequently receives the test results. If satisfactory, additional development tasks are initiated. Otherwise the Engineer debugs the code before resuming programming. This iterative testing process continues until the test is passed or a maximum of 3 retries is reached.

## 4 EXPERIMENTS

### 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING

Datasets We use two public benchmarks, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and a self-generated, more challenging software development benchmark named SoftwareDev: (1) HumanEval includes 164 handwritten programming tasks. These tasks encompass function specifications, descriptions, reference codes, and tests. (2) MBPP consists of 427 Python tasks. These tasks cover core concepts and standard library features and include descriptions, reference codes, and automated tests. (3) Our SoftwareDev dataset is a collection of 70 representative examples of software development tasks, each with its own task prompt (see Table 5). These tasks have diverse scopes (See Figure 5), such as mini-games, image processing algorithms, data visualization. They offer a robust testbed for authentic development tasks. Contrary to previous datasets (Chen et al., 2021a; Austin et al., 2021), SoftwareDev focuses on the engineering aspects. In the comparisons, we randomly select seven representative tasks for evaluation.

Evaluation Metrics For HuamnEval and MBPP, we follow the unbiased version of Pass $@ k$ as presented by (Chen et al., 2021a; Dong et al., 2023), to evaluate the functional accuracy of the top-k generated codes: Pass $@ k=\mathbb{E}_{\text {Problems }}\left[1-\frac{\binom{n-c}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}}\right]$.

For SoftwareDev, we prioritize practical use and evaluate performance through human evaluations (A, E) or statistical analysis (B, C, D): (A) Executability: this metric rates code from 1 (failure/nonfunctional) to 4 (flawless). ' 1 ' is for non-functional, ' 2 ' for runnable but imperfect, ' 3 ' for nearly perfect, and ' 4 ' for flawless code. (B) Cost: the cost evaluations here include the (1) running time, (2) token usage, and (3) expenses. (C) Code Statistics: this includes (1) code files, (2) lines of code per file, and (3) total code lines. (D) Productivity: basically, it is defined as the number of token usage divided by the number of lines of code, which refers to the consumption of tokens per code line. (E) Human Revision Cost: quantified by the number of rounds of revision needed to ensure the smooth running of the code, this indicates the frequency of human interventions, such as debugging or importing packages.

Baselines We compare our method with recent domain-specific LLMs in the code generation field, including AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), Incoder (Fried et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2023), CodeX (Chen et al., 2021a), and CodeT (Chen et al., 2022) and general domain LLMs such as PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Several results of baselines (such as Incoder, CodeGeeX) are provided by Dong et al. (2023).

We modify certain role-based prompts in MetaGPT to generate code suitable for the target problem (e.g., generate functions instead of classes for HumanEval and MBPP). With the SoftwareDev benchmark, we provide a comprehensive comparison between MetaGPT, AutoGPT (Torantulino et al., 2023), LangChain (Chase, 2022) with Python Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool ${ }^{3}$, AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023).

### 4.2 MAIN RESULT

Figure 4: Pass rates on the MBPP and HumanEval with a single attempt.

Performance Figure 4 demonstrates that MetaGPT outperforms all preceding approaches in both HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. When MetaGPT collaborates with GPT-4, it significantly improves the Pass @ $k$ in the HumanEval benchmark compared to GPT-4. It achieves $85.9 \%$ and $87.7 \%$ in these two public benchmarks. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, MetaGPT outperforms ChatDev on the challenging SoftwareDev dataset in nearly all metrics. For example, considering the executability, MetaGPT achieves a score of 3.75 , which is very close to 4 (flawless). Besides, it takes less time (503 seconds), clearly less than ChatDev. Considering the code statistic and the cost of human revision, it also significantly outperforms ChatDev. Although MetaGPT requires more tokens $(24,613$ or 31,255 compared to 19,292 ), it needs only $126.5 / 124.3$ tokens to generate one line of code. In contrast, ChatDev uses 248.9 tokens. These results highlight the benefits of SOPs in collaborations between multiple agents. Additionally, we demonstrate the autonomous software generation capabilities of MetaGPT through visualization samples (Figure 5). For additional experiments and analysis, please refer to Appendix C.[^3]

### 4.3 CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS

Compared to open-source baseline methods such as AutoGPT and autonomous agents such as AgentVerse and ChatDev, MetaGPT offers functions for software engineering tasks. As presented in Table 2, our framework encompasses a wide range of abilities to handle complex and specialized development tasks efficiently. Incorporating SOPs (e.g., role-play expertise, structured communication, streamlined workflow) can significantly improve code generation. Other baseline methods can easily integrate SOP-like designs to improve their performance, similar to injecting chain-ofthought (Wei et al., 2022) in LLMs.

### 4.4 ABLATION STUDY

The Effectiveness of Roles To understand the impact of different roles on the final results, we perform two tasks that involve generating effective code and calculating average statistics. When we exclude certain roles, unworkable codes are generated. As indicated by Table 3 , the addition of roles different from just the Engineer consistently improves both revisions and executability. While more roles slightly increase the expenses, the overall performance improves noticeably, demonstrating the effectiveness of the various roles.

Table 2: Comparison of capabilities for MetaGPT and other approaches. ' $\sqrt{ }$ ' indicates the presence of a specific feature in the corresponding framework, ' $X$, its absence.

The Effectiveness of Executable Feedback Mechanism As shown in Figure 4, adding executable feedback into MetaGPT leads to a significant improvement of $4.2 \%$ and $5.4 \%$ in Pass @1 on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Besides, Table 1 shows that the feedback mechanism improves feasibility ( 3.67 to 3.75 ) and reduces the cost of human revisions (2.25 to 0.83 ). These results illustrate how our designed feedback mechanism can produce higher-quality code. Additional quantitative results of MetaGPT and MetaGPT without executable feedback are shown in Table 4 and Table 6.

## 5 CONCLUSION

This work introduces MetaGPT, a novel meta-programming framework that leverages SOPs to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of multi-agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs). MetaGPT models a group of agents as a simulated software company, analogous to simulated towns (Park et al., 2023) and the Minecraft Sandbox in Voyager (Wang et al., 2023a). MetaGPT leverages role specialization, workflow management, and efficient sharing mechanisms such as message pools and subscriptions, rendering it a flexible and portable platform for autonomous agents and multi-agent frameworks. It uses an executable feedback mechanism to enhance code generation quality during runtime. In extensive experiments, MetaGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The successful integration of human-like SOPs inspires future research on human-inspired techniques for artificial multi-agent systems. We also view our work as an early attempt to regulate LLM-based multi-agent frameworks. See also the outlook (Appendix A).
