#### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in the last few years due to their performance in diverse tasks such as translation, prediction, or content generation. At the same time, the research community has shown that LLMs are susceptible to various attacks but can also improve the security of diverse systems. However, besides enabling more secure systems, how well do open source LLMs behave as covertext distributions to, e.g., facilitate censorship resistant communication?

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of open-source LLM-based covert channels. We approach this problem from the experimental side by empirically measuring the security vs. capacity of the open-source LLM model (Llama-7B) to assess how well it performs as a covert channel. Although our results indicate that such channels are not likely to achieve high practical bitrates, which depend on message length and model entropy, we also show that the chance for an adversary to detect covert communication is low. To ensure that our results can be used with the least effort as a general reference, we employ a conceptually simple and concise scheme and only assume public models.


## 1 Introduction

The last decade has seen an impressive development in machine learning, culminating in the recent enthusiasm around generative models $[41,31]$. Large Language Models proved to be popular with many industries, like education [25] or medicine [11], but also individuals with millions of daily users [1]. The number of new large language models released worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year [39]. Those new models are also becoming more and more powerful, with some models reaching human-level performance on benchmark problems [37]. Large Language Models perform well in tasks like recognition, summarizing, translation, prediction, and content generation. They also found their usage in improving the security of various systems, see, e.g., [23, 32, 9]. Unfortunately, there are also challenges connected with the security and safety of such models. For instance, LLMs can hallucinate $[20,6,45,47]$ or be jailbroken $[36,12]$.

Model inference depends, in addition to internal inference-logic typically constituted by layers of various affine and nonlinear transformations, on temperature and internal randomness to create "liveliness" [38]. By exchanging internal randomness with binary ciphertext sequences (assuming a suitable encoding scheme), we can think of model inference as a process of transforming ciphertexts into specific domain languages (e.g., HTML, images, natural language) of the particular model, much resembling a format transforming encryption (FTE) scheme [15]. In [7], C. Cachin formalizes a model for information theoretic steganography for general covertext distributions and introduces a covert channel based on picking random samples from a partitioned covertext probability distribution. While there have been several attempts to embed covert messages into LLM responses [46, 14, 16], a large part of them altered the model distribution directly, thus, in effect, altering the model itself.

As such, our work uses concepts commonly explored in the cryptographic domain. We note that the idea of connecting machine learning and cryptography is not new, but spans decades, see, e.g., [44, 40, 34]. Moreover, more recently, there have been works using cryptographic concepts to provide stronger theoretical foundations for the security of machine learning [19, 2, 43].

Contributions. In this work, inspired by Cachin's information-theoretic model [7] for steganography, the objective is to provide extensive practical and heuristic analysis of partition-based covert channels using covertext distributions defined by LLMs. Specifically, we extend Cachin's partition-based channel from [7] to a setting where the rate is continuously adjusted according to the token distribution of our LLM. Cachin's proposal is conceptually simple and theoretically sound, and its extension to LLM covertext distributions is straightforward. Moreover, we believe that basing our experiments on the simplicity of the Cachins partition-based approach broadens the impact of our results and can be reused as a basis reference for other schemes and theoretical investigations. Here, ciphertext bits are encoded into token distributions using a partitioning algorithm that adjusts the rate according to varying token distributions. In contrast to recent papers proposing concrete covert channel schemes, our objective is to conduct practical experiments to shed light on the relationship between indistinguishability and channel rate for practical LLM covertext distributions.

## 2 Preliminaries

### 2.1 Llama 2

We use Llama 2 [38] with the 7B-chat set of weights. We selected this model as it is open-source and "small" enough to be run by common users. The general setup in Llama is that text consists of "tokens", words or parts of words. Internally, Llama operates on these tokens, which are represented by integers. In our case, there are $K=32000$ different tokens. The generation of a text proceeds by feeding Llama the prompt. The model then produces a set of $K$ real numbers, $\left(\ell_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{K}$. These are then scaled by a user-supplied "temperature" $T$, and converted to a discrete probability distribution,

$$
q_{i}=\frac{\exp \left(\ell_{i} / T\right)}{\sum_{j}^{K} \exp \left(\ell_{j} / T\right)}
$$

The probabilities are sorted in descending order. Then, a user-supplied cutoff $C$ is applied, by letting $c=1+\max \left\{n: \sum_{i}^{n} q_{i}<C\right\}$, and,

$$
\tilde{p}_{i}= \begin{cases}q_{i} & \text { if } i \leq c \\ 0 & \text { if } i>c\end{cases}
$$

The $\tilde{p}_{i}$ 's are then scaled to have sum $1, p_{i}=\tilde{p}_{i} / \sum_{j} \tilde{p}_{j}$. This yields a probability distribution $\left(\phi_{i}\right)$ over the tokens. A token $w_{t}$ is then sampled from the distribution $\phi_{t}$. This token, an integer, represents a word or part of a word, which is output from Llama as a text. The token is also fed back into Llama to change its state, yielding a new probability distribution $\phi_{t+1}$. Then another token $w_{t+1}$ is sampled from $\phi_{t+1}$. This process continues until a special "end of sequence" (EOS) token is sampled or a maximum length is reached.

### 2.2 Chosen Hyperparameters

To study distributions, we use concepts from information theory. The information in an event that occurs with probability $p$ is defined to be $-\log _{2} p$. The entropy of a probability distribution $\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{k}$
is the expected information $-\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} \log _{2} p_{i}$. One of the uses of entropy is to describe the capacity of a communication channel. We will use text generated by Llama as a communication channel. The entropy of the token distributions is then the maximal bits/token rate we can achieve by encoding bits into token choices.

Llama 2 comes with several sets of parameters and trained models. We have used the 7B-chat models. In Llama runs, we can control the entropy of the token distributions with the "temperature" $T$ and "top-p" $C$ hyperparameters. Too high a temperature (above $\approx 1.3$ ) increases the risk of the model entering a state of logorrhea, where it produces an unintelligible stream of tokens. Experiments we have done show that we can increase $T$ somewhat above 1 without problems. We have looked closer at this in Appendix A. We stick to $T=1.1$, truncating at the $C=0.95$ quantile. The prompt is divided into two parts: a "system" part and a "user" part. For all our experiments, we used the system prompt "Answer like a play by Shakespeare" and the user prompt "Write a story about a humorous encounter with The Hollow Men". We are not interested in the actual tokens, only the distribution of probabilities, irrespective of which tokens they refer to. To collect some distributions, using our prompt and a random seed set from the system clock we let Llama produce 2200 responses. This makes it produce $\approx 1000000$ distributions of average entropy $\approx 1.15$ bits. The token distributions have been captured to a file and used for our analyses. Some examples of the generated text pices are:

(The scene opens in a desolate desert landscape, with the Hollow Men wandering aimlessly in search of sustenance. Enter three bumbling fools, dressed in their finest attire, but with misfortune following them wherever they go.)

Lord High-Fool-in-Waiting: (stumbling upon the Hollow Men) Oh, ho! Good morrow to thee, noble gents! Pray tell, what be thy plight?

Hollow Man 1: (mumbling) Woe is us! Our bellies be empty, and our spirits be crushed.

Lord High-Fool-in-Waiting: (excitedly) Marry, 'tis a wondrous fortnight for thee! Forsooth, I prithee, share with me thy tale of woe, and perhaps, perchance, we may conjure up a merry jest to cheer thee!

Hollow Man 2: (shaking his head) Alas, good sir, our misfortune doth not lend itself to merriment. We are but the Hollow Men, doomed to roam the earth, in search of sustenance that eludes us.

Lord High-Fool-in-Waiting: (stroking his chin) Ah, I see! 'Tis a curious predicament, indeed! (pausing dramatically) By Jove, I believe I have the remedy to cure thy woes! (Produces a small bag of biscuits from his pocket) Behold! These baked delights shall restore thy vigor and cheer!

Hollow Man 3: (with awe) Thank thee, noble sir! We shall devour them with haste!

Lord High-Fool-in-Waiting: (acting mock-offended) Pray, pray, good sirs! As if I would part with such tasty morsels so easily! (Pretends to consider) Methinks I shall demand a small toll in return for my generosity! (grinning mischievously) What say thee, gentle men?

We have removed $\approx 0.6 \%$ of the distributions, those with more than 1024 non-zero probabilities. The distributions we have removed have an average number of non-zero probabilities of 5500 and an average entropy of $\approx 7.5$. We have not inspected the generated texts, but we assume that a token distribution with excessively many non-zero probabilities does not reflect any reasonable text generation but is possibly an artifact of incomplete training of the Llama model and that the probabilities have not quite reached numerically zero. We look more into this in Appendix A.

We use the collected distributions for experiments in Section 5. In Figure 1, a histogram of the entropies is plotted, though, in the plot, we have removed all the zero entropies to have a better scale.

It is not unusual that the entropy of a distribution is zero; in our runs, it happens for $\approx 40 \%$ of the tokens. I.e. there is only a single token of positive probability. In this case, we cannot embed any secret as this would make our scheme more detectable [50]. As a result, we can only use the distributions with higher entropy to encode bits. The mean of the non-zero entropies is $\approx 1.93$ with median $\approx 1.55$. Of course, with a higher entropy distribution, we can encode more than one bit in a single token sample. We look into this in Section 3.

## 3 Encoding Bits by Sampling Inconspicuous Tokens

### 3.1 Setup

Rather than using a (pseudo) random generator to choose tokens from the distributions, we will use the bits of a message to choose tokens. The message bits can be decoded from the generated text by a

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_7ad8935e1fe90dc7ff9ag-04.jpg?height=545&width=827&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=646)

Figure 1: Entropies of the token distributions

receiver running the LLM with the same hyperparameters and prompt. That is, we use the generated text as a communication channel. Our approach is to do this in a way that is hard to distinguish from using a random generator so that the communication is covert.

We assume the message bits are (pseudo) random, e.g., a ciphertext or compressed data of some sort. A simple way to ensure this is to XOR each bit with a bit from a random number generator, e.g., AES in counter mode [13]. An adversary is assumed to know our model with all its parameters but not whether we encode some unknown bits in the tokens or if we sample tokens randomly. Then, the question is, could an adversary reject the null hypothesis that the tokens have been randomly drawn?

Our idea is to partition the probabilities into two sets with almost equal sums. To encode a message bit, we use it to choose between the two sets, and then we draw randomly from the chosen set. The receiver of the generated text, running the same model, can then recover the message bit by determining which of the two sets the token is drawn from. In [26], a related problem occurs. The authors draw tokens from either of two sets when watermarking the output from an LLM, but they are not concerned with keeping the sampling method hidden. Their concern is that the generated text should suffer negligible quality distortions, not that such distortions should be hard to detect.

Next, we formally describe our scheme. The tokens $T=\{1,2, \ldots, K\}$ have corresponding probabilities $P=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{K}$. We start out by finding sets $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$ with $T_{0} \cap T_{1}=\emptyset$, and $T_{0} \cup T_{1}=T$, with corresponding probabilites $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ such that $\sum P_{0} \approx \sum P_{1}$. That is, the tokens have been partitioned into two groups with approximately equal probability sums. If this cannot be done because no subset of $P$ sums to something close to $\frac{1}{2} \sum P$, we cannot encode a bit in this token choice. If, however, we have found suitable $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$, we pick $T_{0}$ to encode a 0 -bit, and $T_{1}$ to encode a 1-bit.

To measure how good the partitioning is, we use the split entropy, $h_{s}=-\left(p \log _{2} p+(1-p) \log _{2}(1-\right.$ $p$ ), where $p=\sum P_{0}$. As a hyperparameter for the encoding, we choose a minimum split entropy $H_{s} \leq 1$ and disallow partitions with $h_{s}<H_{s}$.

We continue this process with the chosen half of the tokens. That is, if we have chosen $T_{0}$, we try to split it into two halves $T_{00}$ and $T_{01}$ with approximately equal probability sums $P_{00}$ and $P_{01}$. If successful, we encode another bit. We continue this process until we are left with a set $T_{\perp}$, which we cannot halve into two almost equal parts. We then draw a token randomly from $T_{\perp}$ according to the probabilities in $P_{\perp}$. The pseudocode for encoding bits in a token choice is given in Algorithm 1. The procedure is assumed to replace the random sampling of tokens in the LLM.

The decoder uses the reverse process and splits $T$ into two halves $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$, using the same method as the encoder. The decoder has received the generated text, knows the token $w$ which was chosen, and decodes a 0 -bit if $w \in T_{0}$, and a 1-bit if $w \in T_{1}$. It then tries to split again and may decode another bit. If unable to split, it goes on to the next token. The pseudocode is given in Algorithm 2.

The split entropy has a relation to the security of the encoding system via [7, Theorem 2]. The theorem states that if the difference $\left|\sum P_{1}-\sum P_{0}\right|$ is $\delta$, the security of the scheme is $\frac{\delta^{2}}{\log _{e} 2}$.

```
Algorithm 1 Use message bits to sample a token
    function ENCODEBITS(bits, $\left.Q, H_{s}\right) \rightarrow$ (number of bits encoded, token)
        $\triangleright Q$ is the vector of token probabilities, bits is a vector of message bits
        $P \leftarrow Q$
        $i \leftarrow 0$
        while PARTITION $\left(P, H_{s}\right) \rightarrow P_{0}, P_{1}$ do
            $i \leftarrow i+1$
            if bits[i] $=0$ then
                $P \leftarrow P_{0}$
            else
                $P \leftarrow P_{1}$
        $\triangleright$ The partitions are assumed to be indexed by indices of $Q$
        $\mathrm{idx} \leftarrow<$ Sample index from $P>$
        return $i$, idx
```

```
Algorithm 2 Decode message bits from a token
    function DECODEBITS(idx, $Q, H_{s}$ ) $\rightarrow$ decoded message bits
        $\triangle$ idx is an index into the token probabilities $Q$
        $P \leftarrow Q$
        bits $\leftarrow \emptyset$
        while PARTition $\left(P, H_{s}\right) \rightarrow P_{0}, P_{1}$ do
            if idx $\in$ indices $\left(P_{0}\right)$ then
                $<$ append 0 to bits>
                $P \leftarrow P_{0}$
            else
                $<$ append 1 to bits $>$
                $P \leftarrow P_{1}$
        return bits
```

With a partition $P_{0}, P_{1}$ with $\sum P_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(1-\delta)$ and $\sum P_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(1+\delta)$, the split entropy is a function, $h(\delta)=-\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-\delta) \log _{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-\delta)\right)+\frac{1}{2}(1+\delta) \log _{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}(1+\delta)\right)\right)$. It is easily shown by applying L'Hôpital's rule twice, that $\lim _{\delta \rightarrow 0}(1-h(\delta)) / \delta^{2}=\frac{1}{2 \log _{e} 2}$. For split entropies $h_{s}$ close to 1 , we therefore have $\frac{\delta^{2}}{\log _{e} 2} \approx 2\left(1-h_{s}\right)$. Thus, the security of our encoding in terms of [7] is $\approx 2\left(1-H_{s}\right)$.

### 3.2 Partitioning the $\mathrm{P}$

The method we have used for splitting a $P \subset \mathbb{R}^{+}$with $\sum P=2 \delta$ is a simple, almost greedy algorithm. We choose a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $2^{k}$ is not too large, e.g., $k=10$.

We sort $P=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i}$ in descending order. Then, we find an $n$ such that $L=\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \approx \delta-\epsilon$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n+k} p_{i} \approx \delta+\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon \geq 0$. For every subset $S$ of $\left\{p_{i}\right\}_{i=n+1}^{n+k}$, we compute $s=L+\sum S$, and choose the $S$ that minimizes $|s-\delta|$. We let $P_{0}=\left\{p_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{n} \cup S$, and $P_{1}=P \backslash P_{0}$.

With $p=\frac{1}{2 \delta} \sum P_{0}$, we can compute the entropy of the split, $h_{s}=-\left(p \log _{2} p+(1-p) \log _{2}(1-p)\right)$. We deem the split acceptable if $h_{s} \geq H_{s}$.

If we aim for encoding no more than 1 bit in each token, we should use a large $k$. Since we are partitioning the result again ( $P_{0}$ or $P_{1}$ ), this is not necessarily optimal. A near-perfect split may make further splits harder. Our experiments show that lowering $k$ to 3 improves the overall performance of the encoding because then the chosen partition tends to be easier to partition again, leading to more bits being encoded in a single token choice. However, the closer to 1 we choose $H_{s}$, the larger $k$ should be. Based on preliminary experiments, we use $k=\left\lfloor-\log \left(1-H_{s}\right)-0.5\right\rfloor$, and clamp $k$ between 2 and 16 .

Our partitioning method takes exponential time in the parameter $k$. Faster methods are known, among them variants of the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm, like [27]. However, we are not time-constrained with $k \leq 16$. Partitioning takes microseconds instead of nanoseconds. Moreover, experiments have shown that while the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm may find more equal partitions, our almost greedy
method performs better in terms of bit rate when we partition repeatedly as in Algorithm 1. However, for $H_{s}>0.99998$, the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm performs better for our data.

One potential problem is that the approximate splits introduce slightly skewed samples of tokens. That is, a partitioning into $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$, followed by a sample from one of them depending on a random message bit, ensures that the probability of drawing a token in $P_{0}$ becomes exactly 0.5 . The probability should be $\sum P_{0}$, which is only approximately 0.5 . An adversary with access to many sampled tokens and the model can perceive that something is not entirely right with the token samples, e.g., with the methods in section 4.

In terms of information theory, we are encoding a random bit into a choice that has slightly less entropy than 1. As a result, information will fail to add up in one way or another. This can also happen in [26], but their watermarking is not kept secret; it only has a negligible impact on the quality of the text generation.

We note that, like with Huffman codes [29], if all probabilities $p_{i}$ were powers of 2 , the encoding would be perfect, and the average number of bits we could encode would equal the entropy of the token distribution. An encoding of random bits would be indistinguishable from an ordinary generated text.

Allowing more inaccurate splits will increase the possible encoding bit rate by splitting more probability sets, but it will also increase the possibility of adversaries being able to discover that something is wrong with the generated text. Thus, we need to account for this trade-off.

## 4 Detecting Anomalous Token Samples

As above, we denote by $\phi_{n}$ the discrete distribution from which the $n$th token is sampled. We denote its $K$ probabilities by $\left(p_{k}^{n}\right)_{k=1}^{K}$. If we somehow manipulate the sampling of tokens, we must make sure that it still looks like we have sampled randomly from the token distributions $\phi_{n}$. A manipulation could, e.g., lead to a bias in the probabilities of the tokens that are selected or too many too small and too large probabilities. Such bias could make our covert channel less stealthy and more easily detected. Here, we describe a simple test that can be used to test if a sequence of tokens has the expected information content.

When we draw a token, it has a specific probability $p_{k}^{n}$, and we denote its information, a random variable, by $h_{n}=-\log p_{k}^{n}$. The entropy of $\phi_{n}$ is denoted by $H_{n}=\mathbb{E}\left(h_{n}\right)=-\sum_{k} p_{k}^{n} \log p_{k}^{n}$, the expectation of the random variable $h_{n}$. We denote by $D_{n}=H_{n}-h_{n}$ a random variable that measures the deviation from the expected information.

When $N$ tokens have been sampled, we form the random variable $D=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n} D_{n}$. We have $\mu=\mathbb{E}(D)=0$ and variance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^{2} & =\operatorname{Var} D=\operatorname{Var}\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n} H_{n}-h_{n}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{n} \operatorname{Var} h_{n} \\
& =\frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{n} \mathbb{E}\left(h_{n}^{2}\right)-\mathbb{E}\left(h_{n}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

An actual realization of tokens then produces a sequence of tokens with information $\hat{h}_{n}$, and then a $\hat{D}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n}\left(H_{n}-\hat{h}_{n}\right)$, drawn from $D$. Now, $D$ is an average of random variables $D_{n}$, and it is no surprise that it is close to being normally distributed. We can then test how close $\hat{D}$ is to $\mathbb{E}(D)=0$ by computing a $z$-score, $z=|\hat{D}| / \sigma$, and compute a $p$-value as $p=2(1-\Phi(z))$, where $\Phi$ is the standard normal cdf. The $p$-value is the probability that we draw a $d$ from $D$ with $|d| \geq|\hat{D}|$. A $p$-value close to zero is unlikely if tokens are drawn properly from their distributions.

In Figure 2, a quantile-quantile plot of the $p$-values when we are not encoding bits against a uniform $[0,1]$ distribution is shown. It is the result of 500 runs of drawing randomly from 5000 token distributions. It is close to a straight line, showing that our $p$-values are indeed uniformly distributed. That is, $D$ is close to normally distributed.

Figure 2: QQ plot of $\mathrm{p}$-values and a uniform distribution

Similarly, we can consider the quantity $D_{2}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n}\left(H_{n}-h_{n}\right)^{2}$ to test the variance of the information. For our data and methods, experiments show that a test based on $D_{2}$ requires more token samples to detect anomalies, so we do not use it. It could, however, be useful if other methods for encoding are used.

In this test, the tokens sampled by the adversary are those that are actually useful for encoding bits. That is, token distributions that can be partitioned with a split entropy $h_{s} \geq H_{s}$. If the encoding scheme is unknown to the adversary, all the tokens in the generated text should be included.

## 5 Experimental Results

We have experimented with the Llama token distributions described in Section 2. We encode a stream of random bits with the scheme presented in Section 3. Finally, we try to detect the presence of the resulting skewed sampling with the methods given in Section 4.

(b) Detection rate

Figure 3: Bit rate and detection rate

In Figure 3a, the minimum split entropy $H_{s}$ is varied from 0.9 to 0.9999 . We have plotted the resulting bit rate from encoding random bits in our token distributions. The dashed line is the average entropy of the token distributions. As $H_{s}$ approaches 1, we see a dramatic drop in bit rate. There are fewer token distributions that can possibly be partitioned with such precision, and therefore, fewer tokens that can be used for encoding bits, resulting in a lower bit rate.

In Figure 3b, we have done 1000 runs of encoding random bitstreams for each $H_{s}$, with varying numbers of token distributions drawn from our Llama collection. We have plotted the fraction with the $p$-value (from Section 4) below $10^{-6}$. While this could be considered a somewhat arbitrary significance level, it clearly shows how the bit rate and the number of tokens influence the anomaly detection rate. For $10^{6}$ tokens, we have added significance levels 0.001 and 0.05 as well.

We see that we can achieve a bit rate of $\approx 0.9$ bits/token without a large probability of being detected for 10000 tokens. However, if we want to stay undetected for 50000 tokens, we must lower the bit
rate to 0.8 or below. If we use $H_{s}=0.995$, we achieve a bit rate of $\approx 0.55$, and we need to analyze $\approx 10^{6}$ tokens to spot the irregularity reliably. That being said, there could be more efficient methods for detecting anomalous token choices than those in Section 4.

It is known [18] that distinguishing two finite probability distributions with statistical distance $\epsilon$ can be done with $O\left(\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ samples. So given a limit $N$ to the number of tokens, we should have $\epsilon<N^{-1 / 2}$, for simplicity removing the $O$. Our partitioning of the probability distributions changes the probabilities a slight amount, one partition has sum $p=0.5-\delta$ whereas the other has sum $1-p$. This means that the actual probabilities are slightly changed, yielding a statistical distance at most $\delta$. This translates to a minimum split entropy $H_{s}$ and, thus, a theoretically safe bit rate. In Figure 4a, we have plotted these for our set of token distributions. This is a lower bound for the safe bitrates, though

In Figure 4 b, we have used our collection of $\approx 1000000$ distributions to encode random bits, and have made $10000 \mathrm{p}$-values for $H_{s} \in 0.995 . .0 .999$, and made QQ-plots against a uniform distribution. We see that the $\mathrm{p}$-values do not become reasonably uniform until the bit rate drops below 0.5 bits/token. But even with a bit rate of 0.46 , our $p$-values are not entirely uniform.

As noted in Section 3, our partitioning causes the effective probabilities to be slightly perturbed. The difference from the original token distributions can be measured with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This is a common metric used in, e.g., [5]. In Figure 5, we provide a plot of the average $\mathrm{K}$-L divergence and the bit rate. The jumps correspond to where we adjust the $k$ in our almost greedy partitioning algorithm. In the plot, we have also included the security of the scheme as described in Section 3, that is, the quantity $2\left(1-H_{s}\right)$.

## 6 Discussion and Limitations

Discussion. Due to their power and widespread usage, it becomes more challenging to recognize if some content is produced by LLMs or humans [8, 22]. This has led to increased research efforts into tools for fighting disinformation, such as various model watermarking approaches $[10,3,17,26$, $30,33,42,48,49,51$ ] or tools for showing the provenance of data even after data manipulation [28]. While re-engineering trust and provenance into data supply chains is a significant step towards establishing trust, the fundamental problem of deciding whether a piece of synthetic data has been produced by a model or not will likely remain a major challenge in many areas [22, 35]. Then, if it is computationally infeasible to distinguish synthetic from "organic" data, it is computationally infeasible to detect encrypted covert channels based on the same covertext distributions.

Several concrete proposals for covert channel schemes utilizing LLMs as covertext distributions have been proposed during the last few years, including the recently proposed $[24,4,50]$. These new proposals vary in the way cryptographic keystream is encoded into model responses, but they are all several orders more rigorous when it comes to security arguments in comparison to many of the previous attempts (such as [46, 14, 16]). For instance, a reasonable assumption that was not present in many of the previous schemes is the notion that the enemy knows everything but the key. In particular, anything (such as the model distribution) should be assumed compromised except the secret key variables. Designs constructed under these assumptions not only allow for cleaner analysis but typically also increase the practicality of the final schemes. Our main objective here was to conduct extensive experiments on the relationship between covert channel bandwidth and distinguishing probability based on a conceptually simple scheme adopted from the earlier fundamental work on secure covert channels in [7]. Using a simple and clean scheme allows us to conduct practical experiments that hopefully can be reused by others for both theoretical analysis and comparison with minimal effort.

Limitations. While we focus on open-source models in this work, specifically Llama 2 with the 7B-chat set of weights, it is far from the only option. Our main argument for using open-source models is that they can be downloaded and run locally and, as such, are a good testbed. However, our experiments indicate, which has also been noted by others [50, 21], that Llama 2 has a low generation entropy, which in practice lowers the capacity of the covert channels in our experiments. Since, based on the method we use for encoding keystream into covertext, our channel capacity is expected to be close to the model in use, it should be possible to extrapolate a tendency with respect to other models. Due to the simplicity of our approach, it takes little effort to adapt our experiment to another model. Moreover, we use the Shakespeare style for the generated text. One could question whether other styles offer a similar (or better) capacity to establish a covert channel.

Future work. This work positions itself at the intersection of information-theoretical foundations and experimental validation. It would be interesting to provide more theoretical considerations on covert channels in LLMs.

Broader Impact. In this paper, we show how an LLM can be used as a covert channel. Such a method can be used to avoid censorship in totalitarian regimes. A possible negative impact could be that this mechanism could be used to transmit untraceable messages that facilitate illegal activities.

## 7 Conclusions

It is possible to use large language models for covert communication by embedding hidden messages in ordinary text. We cannot expect a high bit rate, perhaps somewhere in the ballpark of 1 bit per word on average. The bit rate must be chosen wisely, depending on how long messages we intend to hide. In practice, the detection probability analyzed in this paper is very conservative. It assumes that an adversary knows exactly which LLM is used and what its parameters are. If this is actually known by a real-world adversary, it is a reasonable assumption that they already know that hidden messages are encoded. If this strong assumption is relaxed, the hidden communication can be virtually impossible to detect.
