#### Abstract

Large text corpora are the backbone of language models. However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose What's In My Big Data? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities-count and search-at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about $50 \%$ of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE. We open-source wIMBD's code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them.


# 1 INTRODUCTION 

Data is the foundation upon which machine learning (ML) is built. The introduction of new datasets drives progress, playing a crucial role in facilitating research and the creation of models with novel capabilities. Over time, the computational cost of AI experiments has dramatically increased, partly due to training increasingly large models on increasingly large datasets (Schwartz et al. 2020; Sevilla et al. 2022); today, some of the most impactful datasets are being created by scraping text from the entire publicly-available internet (Raffel et al., 2020; Together Computer, 2023, Penedo et al., 2023; Soldaini et al. 2024). These are some of the largest text datasets that have ever been built, and they are typically introduced with only a description of how they were made but no documentation of their contents. This is an important distinction, as we are now training models on massive text corpora without knowing what ideas, topics, toxicity, or personal information they contain.

Meanwhile, language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous and are used by people worldwide daily. These AI systems directly impact people's lives, and thus, it has become vitally important to understand their capabilities and drawbacks. Models are only capable of learning from the data they were trained on, but analysis of pretraining corpora is hindered by lack of public release and by their massive size. Work analyzing the contents of web-scale corpora typically focuses on a subset of important dimensions, and there has been almost no work analyzing multiple datasets across the same dimensions. This means that ML practitioners have no practical tools to describe differences between datasets before choosing which one(s) to use.

Figure 1: An overview of wiMBD. We implement two fundamental capabilities: Count and Search, allowing quick processing and access to large text corpora, which enables a wide range of analyses.

In this work, we propose to investigate the content of large text corpora using WhAT's In MY BIG DATA (WIMBD), a set of tools that enables practitioners to easily explore and quickly analyze large language datasets. We also use this tool to provide some of the first measurements across different web-scale datasets that are directly comparable. WIMBD has two components: (1) a search tool that enables programmatic access to search for documents containing a query using an Elasticsearch $\prod^{1}$ (ES) index. ES is a search engine that allows retrieving strings from a corpus, the documents where they appeared, and the number of times they appeared. (2) a count functionality, built using map-reduce (Dean \& Ghemawat, 2008), allowing quick iteration over an entire dataset and extraction of relevant information, e.g., the character length distribution of documents, duplicates, domain counts, finding personally identifiable information (PII), and more. WIMBD is extendable and can be used to index, count, and analyze other corpora at scale (we benchmark the runtimes in Appendix D.

Using these tools, we perform a set of sixteen analyses on ten different English corpora used to train LMs, including C4 (used to train T5; Raffel et al. 2020), The Pile (used to train Pythia; Gao et al. 2020, Biderman et al., 2022; 2023), and RedPajama (used to reproduce Llama, Touvron et al. 2023, and to train RedPajama-INCITE; Together Computer 2023). We divide our analyses into four categories: (1) data statistics (e.g., number of tokens and domain distribution; $\$ 4.2$; (2) data quality (e.g., most frequent $n$-grams and measuring duplicate documents; 4.3 ; ; (3) community- and societyrelevant measurements (e.g., benchmark contamination and personally identifiable information detection; \$4.4; and (4) cross-corpora analysis (e.g., comparing the most common $n$-gram and document overlap; $\$$ B.4. An illustration of WIMBD is presented in Figure 1

Our work presents many insights on data distribution and anomalies. For example, inspecting the distribution over document lengths exposes anomalies where specific lengths are overrepresented relative to neighboring lengths; these anomalies often correspond to near-duplicate template-generated text or documents arbitrarily truncated to a specific character length. As another example, punctuation sequences are frequently the most common $n$-grams, such as a dash (' - ') repeated ten times as the most common 10-gram in The Pile. WIMBD offers both retrospective documentation and grounding of model behavior to their training data and actionable insights for higher-quality corpora curation.

## 2 BACKGROUND: ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA UNDERSTANDING

There have been repeated calls for ML practitioners to provide better data documentation (e.g., McMillan-Major et al., 2023; Bender \& Friedman, 2018; Mitchell et al., 2023, Pistilli et al., 2023; Paullada et al., 2021; Gebru et al., 2021). On the other hand, some of the most impactful ML models are increasingly opaque, specifically with respect to the most important component of recent advancements: data. With the increasingly competitive nature of the field, developers of systems like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM-2 (Google, 2023) have been offering little transparency into the most important development decisions, including the sources, size, and contents of their training data.

As web-scale datasets drive this rapid progress in modern ML systems, the gap between data transparency and documentation is more striking than ever (Kaddour et al. 2023). From a technical standpoint, the massive size of these datasets makes analysis of their contents challenging; even if OpenAI or Google shared their training data, it's unclear where to start understanding it in its entirety. Tools like the Data Measurements Tool (Luccioni et al. 2021) and Know Your Data (Google, 2021) work towards improving data documentation, but focus on smaller datasets since the scale of web data leads to significant technical challenges. Our work aims to address this critical missing component.[^0]

While other works support indexing and analyses of large corpora (Piktus et al. 2023a; Marone \& Van Durme, 2023, Simig et al., 2022, Piktus et al., 2023b, Razeghi et al., 2022b), these efforts support a single corpus and often do not support programmatic access to the data or the analysis. Instead, we offer a holistic approach that combines search and counting with a package that allows programmatic access through wrappers on top of the ES API and extendable efficient counting capabilities.

Additional efforts are concerned with the effect of data on model behavior. Longpre et al. (2023) investigate how the composition of LMs' pretraining data influences their downstream performance. Razeghi et al. (2022a) measure high correlation between term frequency and LMs' few-shot reasoning capabilities with those terms. Shin et al. (2022) study the effect of pretraining corpora on in-context abilities. Seshadri et al. (2023) demonstrate that text-to-image models mimic biases from their training data. Akyurek et al. (2022) study fact tracing for identifying pretraining examples that enable a factual assertion, while Guu et al. (2023) offer a training run simulator, which allows making counterfactual queries on what a model would have learned under a different training procedure. These efforts separately built dedicated infrastructure to perform the studies. Our work provides a dedicated interface and tooling that allows performing a wide range of analyses on large-scale corpora, categorizing and offering novel analyses that highlight new insights into these large corpora.

## 3 WIMBD: THE PLATFORM

A core desideratum of WIMBD is to enable quick processing of terabytes of data. As such, we focus on uncomplicated, standard methods from the information retrieval and data management communities. WIMBD is comprised of two basic components: counting and search (retrieval). Fast counting and retrieving enable us to answer fundamental questions about data, as we demonstrate in Section 4. We summarize the framework abilities and types of analyses in Table 1 . We run our experiments using a compute node machine with 224 CPUs and 882GB RAM, and an Elasticsearch cluster for the indexed corpora.

### 3.1 COUNTING

Due to the sparsity of language data and the scale of the data of interest, accurate counting can be challenging. We leverage the map-reduce framework (Dean \& Ghemawat, 2008). We provide two approaches for counting, described below.

Exact Counts The exact counts approach is designed for cases where the number of possible values is tractable and can fit in memory. This fits cases where we are interested in calculating a bound number of variables of interest (e.g., number of documents, $\$ 4.2$. or document length, $\$ 4.3 .3$ ).

Compressed Counts The compressed counts approach is designed for cases where the number of possible values is intractable. For instance, the total 10-grams in a large corpus can be very high, and the memory usage to compute all of them would be overwhelming. Similarly, finding duplicates requires keeping and comparing the strings of all documents in memory. In the case of $C 4$, that would require over $800 \mathrm{~GB}$ of RAM. Instead, we apply a compression function (e.g., hashing, Bloom, 1970) to those values, reducing memory footprint while sacrificing some accuracy (due to hash collisions). For example, when finding the most common 10-grams, we store a table of counts where the keys in the table correspond to hashes of 10 -grams. The hash table size is configurable according to the amount of memory available. The larger the hash table, the smaller the probability of hash collisions and, therefore, the higher the accuracy of the counts. E.g., unigram estimates are more accurate than 10 -gram estimates since the number of possible values is much smaller.

### 3.2 SEARCHING

The second part of WIMBD allows fast text retrieval. For instance, we can get the number of documents mentioning a word or sequence (document frequency). It also allows more complex Boolean queries. While search and retrieval have numerous implementations, such as reverse indices, suffix arrays,

suffix trees for exact match search, and dense retrieval for fuzzy search, in this work, we use ES, an inverted index. We build a wrapper on top of the ES API, allowing tailored and customized searches to fit our analysis requirements. We leave it to future work to explore other search alternatives.

## 4 WIMBD: THE ANALYSES

This section presents analyses conducted in WIMBD, grouped by category. First, we describe the ten corpora considered in this study ( $\$ 4.1$. We then consider four high-level categories, each split into several analyses: data statistics ( $\$ 4.2$ ), data quality ( $\$ 4.3$ ), and community- and society-relevant measurements ( $\$ 4.4$ ). Cross-corpus analyses, as well as elaborations and more analyses are presented in the appendix ( $\S \mathrm{B}$ ). Our analyses are inspired by previous works (Dodge et al., 2021, Gao et al., 2020), but we expand them to multiple corpora, extend the types of analyses, and open-source our modular toolkit to encourage researchers to scrutinize their corpora. We offer the first extensive analyses on ten, combining extension of previous analyses and several novel ones.

### 4.1 CORPORA

We cover ten different large corpora, spanning across text-only (e.g., C4) to image captions (LAION$2 B$-en) and code (The Stack). These corpora have been used in training language models (or similar large-scale models, such as Stable Diffusion; Rombach et al. 2022). A high-level description of these datasets using WIMBD is presented in Table 2 and further details about the construction and origin of these corpora are detailed in Appendix A

### 4.2 DATA STATISTICS

## Main Findings

- Four out of the ten corpora we consider have 'empty' documents (meaning they contain only space-like characters), while The Pile and RedPajama contain the same longest document (with over 28 million tokens) of an encyclopedia.
- While the most common source of webpages in $C 4$ originates from www.nytimes.com it consists of less than $0.05 \%$ of the total web pages, $m C 4$-en most common domain is google.com (over 5\% of the documents), and cdn.shopify.com contributes almost $6 \%$ to the total documents in LAION-2B-en.


### 4.2.1 SUMMARY StATISTICS

We begin by computing some summary statistics and present the results in Table 2. Using the Exact Counts we compute the following high-level statistics of a corpus: (1) size, (2) number of documents, (3) number of tokens. ${ }^{2}$ (4) the size of the longest document, and (5) the size of the shortest document. Out of all corpora, mC4-en is the largest, which takes $14.7 \mathrm{~TB}$ of disk, and 2.7 trillion tokens. After that comes The Stack with a size of 7.8TB, and more than 1.5 trillion tokens. Interestingly, four corpora contain documents with empty strings: LAION-2B-en (81 total), which typically contain a sequence of white spaces. In The Stack $(1,350$ total), RedPajama $(3,877)$, and The[^1]

Figure 2: Domain distribution of the ten most common domains per token for C4, LAION-2B-en, and RedPajama.

Pile (7,533), documents typically contain a mix of special characters that denote spacing (e.g., ' $\backslash \mathrm{n}$ ', or ' $\backslash t$ '). In RedPajama, all of the empty strings are from the arXiv subset. The longest document in The Stack is a json file, with $26,298,134$ tokens from http://jquery.com/ The longest document in The Pile and RedPajama is the same encyclopedia book called "INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE SOCIAL \& BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES" from the Books3 subset with 28,121,329 tokens.

### 4.2.2 INTERNET DOMAIN DISTRIBUTION

Some corpora contain metadata information about the URL where the documents came from. As such, we employ the Exact Counts functionality, to parse the entire corpus, and extract information from the URLs about the (1) schemas (e.g., http, https), (2) domains (e.g., www.google.com. en.wikipedia.org, etc.), and (3) suffixes (e.g., com, org, de, etc.).

We apply these counts on the corpora that contain this information, namely $C 4$, mC4-en, OSCAR, RedPajama, and LAION-2B-en. Starting with the domain analysis, we perform these counts twice: once when each domain is counted per document (yielding documents per domain) and another where each domain is counted per token (yielding tokens per domain). We present the results of three corpora per token in Figure 2 (and the full results in Appendix B.1). First, we note that $C 4$ contains documents from a diverse set of domains, and even the percentage of the most common one, patents.google.com, is less than $0.05 \%$. On the other hand, in the case of LAION$2 B$-en, cdn.shopify.com is responsible for more than $6 \%$ of the documents. Similarly, arxiv.org is responsible for more than $12 \%$ of the documents in RedPajama. We showcase the results of the domains for the other corpora, as well as the schemas and suffixes in Appendix B. 1 .

### 4.3 DATA QUALITY

## Main Findings

- The most common $n$-grams often correspond to repeated punctuation marks and duplicates.
- While more than $60 \%$ of documents in The Pile are duplicates (unsurprisingly due to oversampling), RedPajama and LAION-2B-en also contain about $50 \%$ duplicate documents.
- Document length distribution reveals interesting (and unexpected) outliers of documents, often resulting from duplicate documents and idiosyncratic data decisions.


### 4.3.1 MoST \& LEAST COMMON $n$-GRAMS

Measuring outliers can reveal interesting insights about a corpus (Mitchell et al. 2023), We explore the most and least common token $n$-grams of each corpus using the Compressed Counts . We compute the $10 \mathrm{~K}$ most common $n$-grams for all corpora, with $n \in\{1,2,3,10\}$. We report the results of the ten most common 10-grams in Table 3 and of the ten most common uni-, bi-, and tri-grams in Table 9 in the Appendix. Identical $n$-grams across corpora are highlighted in the same colors.

The different corpora contain a lot of uncleaned html or markdown format (e.g., ten times '?' or 'amp'), or boilerplate texts such as: ". You can follow any responses to this entry through" in C4, or "( Log Out / Change ) You are commenting using" in OSCAR, and formatting (" [1] [2] [ 3 ] [") in S2ORC and peS2o, which signifies references.

A striking finding from this analysis is the vast repetition of such 10 -grams. For instance, '?', '.', and '-' repeated ten times appear $9,7.2$, and 4.4 million times, respectively, in $C 4$. We perform a manual analysis on the repeating question marks in $C 4$ to better understand the scenarios where they

Table 3: Most common 10-grams in five of the corpora we consider. $n$-grams from the top-10 that occur in more than one corpus are highlighted in the same color.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_08d472c4aa090b7ab135g-06.jpg?height=347&width=1393&top_left_y=377&top_left_x=363)

appear on the ten consecutive question marks symbols and categorize each appearance into writing, noise, and format occurrence. Analyzing 100 random documents, we found that $68 \%$ of documents use such $n$-grams as part of their writing style (e.g., . . \$6???????????? How is that possible?, or . . So what do u think?????????????????????????). $18 \%$ are due to noise as we could not understand the context or content of the writing (e.g., . . . e ??????????????? kap chit-koa ??), and finally, $14 \%$ of the documents were due to different format styles or issues (e.g., a sequence of question marks following by a 'normal' text, or a sequence of question marks between keywords).

### 4.3.2 DUPLICATES

Previous work has found that duplication can affect the quality of pretraining data, impacting sample efficiency (Lee et al., 2022, Tirumala et al. 2023) and memorization (Carlini et al. 2023). While more recent work finds contradictory evidence on data with less web-scraped text (Biderman et al., 2023), measuring duplication in pretraining data is necessary for future research on its effects. We calculate duplicates by matching documents with an MD5 hash of their texts (using Compressed Counts ). If more than a single document has the same hash, we consider them duplicates ${ }^{3}$ We examine the duplication of document text and URLs within each dataset. While some datasets explicitly deduplicate their content, others do not, and some even oversample some sources.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_08d472c4aa090b7ab135g-06.jpg?height=344&width=634&top_left_y=1541&top_left_x=369)

In Figure 3 we show counts and ratios of duplication across datasets with greater than $1 \%$ documents duplicated, and all datasets are shown in Table 13 in the appendix. These are based on two kinds of counts: (1) the count of documents in all clusters of duplicate text (in blue) and (2) the count of duplicate clusters (in orange). As expected, deduplicated corpora such as $C 4$ have no exact duplicates (as those were filtered out of the corpus). In contrast, The Pile, which intentionally oversampled some data sources, has many duplicates ( $139 \mathrm{M}$ documents belonging to $64.6 \mathrm{M}$ duplicate text clusters). LAION-2B-en has the second highest ratio of duplicate documents (1.25B documents belonging to $342 \mathrm{M}$ duplicate text clusters), perhaps due to the smaller space of short sentences common in[^2]its image "alt text" source. Figure 15 in the appendix showcase the images of the most common duplicates in LAION-2B-en, with the most common images describe mainly receipts.

Table 4 showcases duplicates with the most occurrences in four corpora. These duplicates vary dramatically in length and domain. LAION-2B-en, OSCAR, and RedPajama have clusters with the most occurrences, in the hundreds of thousands and above. Top duplicates in LAION-2B-en are shorter and describe products and website features. OSCAR's top duplicates are all instances of website boilerplate $4^{4}$ RedPajama's top duplicates come from similar templated citation information.

### 4.3.3 DOCUMENT LENGTH DISTRIBUTION

We compute document length distributions with Exact Counts . We expect a smooth distribution over document lengths, and deviation from such a distribution may indicate the presence of artificial documents or near duplicates ${ }^{5}$ We compute the character length distribution and present results for three corpora in Figure 4 (additional results in Appendix B.2.3).

While $C 4$ is free of duplicate documents, it include clusters of template-generated near-duplicate documents exposed by outliers of identical document lengths. Beyond template-generated user-facing copy (e.g., template-generated documents from a reverse phone lookup site, each associated with a unique phone number), we find clusters of template-generated JavaScript snippets, and large collections of unique documents, including

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_08d472c4aa090b7ab135g-07.jpg?height=379&width=491&top_left_y=678&top_left_x=1267)

Figure 4: Distribution over character document lengths (in log-scale) for $C 4$, OSCAR and The Pile. numerous permutations of the same keywords, likely crafted for SEO purposes.

The Pile, featuring the longest documents, has a notable outlier with nearly $1 \%$ of its documents precisely 8,194 characters long. These outliers are derived from the DeepMind Mathematics dataset (Saxton et al., 2019), truncated to fit this length. The Pile also contains a significant number of short template-generated code snippets, e.g., a number of documents (of lengths 9,18 , and 36 tokens) each corresponding to a unique publication in various medical journals, and to auto-generated metadata files (of length 20 tokens) used in the Unity game engine. While OSCAR has no documents shorter than 100 characters, as those were filtered, it contains many near-duplicate documents that correspond to website boilerplate, e.g., template-generated FAQs about how to use the forum software phpBB.

### 4.4 CommunitY- And SocIETY-RELEVAnt MEASUREMENTS

## Main Findings

- Instances of popular benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE, were found in various corpora (e.g., C4 and RedPajama), render them unusable for fair model evaluation.
- Automatic toxicity detection reveals that $1-16.5 \%$ of the documents in the corpora contain toxic language using an automatic classifier and between 0.01-16.6\% using a taxonomy.
- An estimated $200 \mathrm{M}, 4 \mathrm{~B}$, and $97 \mathrm{M}$ of email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses were found in the most PII-contaminated corpora per token (mC4-en).


### 4.4.1 BENCHMARK CONTAMINATION

As corpora grow and new evaluation datasets are created, the risk of contamination-where evaluation data are included in a (pre)training corpus-increases. As such, it is important to track contamination (Sainz et al. 2023; Jacovi et al. 2023) $6^{6}$ Using Search, we provide a contamination analysis of 82 datasets for four popular corpora: The Pile, C4, RedPajama, and OSCAR. We consider all datasets[^3]

from PromptSource (Bach et al. 2022), a repository containing prompts for 279 different datasets (as of May 2023). We filter datasets we cannot automatically download, from Huggingface datasets (Lhoest et al. 2021), and datasets that do not have a test split. In addition, we only consider datasets that contain at least two inputs (e.g., natural language inference), leaving us with 82 datasets.

We measure contamination by testing whether all input fields are present in a single document and report the percentage of contaminated examples from the test set. Our contamination evaluation serves as an upper bound of exact-match dataset contamination. We provide more details of our analysis and design choices in Appendix B.3.1

Contaminated datasets We present the results in Figure 5. We showcase all benchmarks whose contamination percentages are at least $5 \%$ in one of the four corpora. We find that RedPajama is the most contaminated dataset out of the four, where in eight out of the 15 corpora, its contamination rate is above $50 \%$, and fully contaminated in the case of COPA (Roemmele et al., 2011). The Pile's contamination rates are lower, but it is also contaminated with a few datasets, such as aesic (Zhang \& Tetreault, 2019), WSC (Levesque et al. 2012) and WIC (Pilehvar \& Camacho-Collados, 2019), which were included in the SuperGLUE evaluation benchmark (Wang et al., 2019).

Most examined datasets were not found in the corpora. It is important to note that while we find some contamination, most of the considered benchmarks do not appear in the corpora we investigated (67 out of the 82 datasets). For instance, Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al. 2021), a large corpus in the style of the Winograd schema, does not appear in any of the examined corpora.

### 4.4.2 PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

PII is "information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc." (Johnson III, 2007). Recent research has sought to extract PII from LMs (Carlini et al., 2021). These attacks highlight that LMs can ingest and reproduce PII contained in their training data, and show the risks of training on data that contains such information, even if the data remains private.

We document three kinds of personally identifiable information in pretraining corpora: phone numbers, email addresses, and IP addresses. We employ regular expres-
Table 5: Extrapolated PII frequencies. Count is the extrapolated frequency and Prec. is our identification precision accuracy, estimated by manual analysis of 100 random examples.

sions corresponding to each PII type using the Exact Counts. We provide more details about our methodology, the regexes, additional results, and error analyses in Appendix B.3.2. We conduct a manual analysis to estimate the precision of these methods on all corpora. The results of this analysis, as well as the extrapolated frequency of these matches, are presented in Table 5. Our identification method is highly precise ( $>80 \%$ precision) for email addresses on eight out of 10 corpora, and for phone numbers on five of the 10 corpora. Overall, most corpora contain a high volume of PII information, varying in type based on the corpus. For instance, RedPajama contain mainly phone numbers (70.2M) and a smaller amount of IP Addresses (1.1M), but $S 2 O R C$ and peS2o contain mainly email addresses ( $630 \mathrm{~K}$ and $418 \mathrm{~K}$, respectively) and no IP addresses were identified. The most common PII across corpora is phone numbers, followed by email addresses and IP addresses (except for The Stack, which has more IP addresses than email addresses: $4.4 \mathrm{M}$ vs. $4.3 \mathrm{M}$, and peS2o, which has more email addresses than phone numbers). Finally, we observe that $m C 4$-en contains the largest amount of PII, also when controlling for the number of tokens (Table 19 in the Appendix).

## 5 DISCUSSION

Data is one of the most poorly understood and studied components in ML research since "everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work" (Sambasivan et al. 2021). Yet, it is one of the most critical factors for successfully training a state-of-the-art language model. While the benefit of increasing model size is evident from the trend of recent years, it is not enough by itself, as the amount and quality of data are crucial (Kaplan et al., 2020).

Data Curation With the increasing data needed to train LMs (and other models for other modalities), it remains challenging to curate high-quality datasets. Besides the technical challenges of composing a large-scale dataset and the decisions that go into making it, these decisions and their influence on the final models are costly to assess due to the high computational resources required to train such models. With WIMBD, we hope to ease the decisions that go into crafting large-scale datasets by surfacing patterns and trends about what goes into them and what is left out from different aspects, such as data quality, community and society measurements, etc. Once decisions upon what data is important, and which should be left out of a dataset, practitioners can filter documents or passages that adhere to such decisions. The curation of the Dolma dataset (Soldaini et al. 2024) that happened while developing this work benefited from iterations over the insights from this work, such as the finding of 'noisy' most-common $n$-grams, and bugs in the initial 'de-duplication' implementation.

Data Documentation Adding to previous works that call for more data documentation, such as Datasheets (Gebru et al. 2021) and Data Statements (McMillan-Major et al., 2023), we argue for the importance of documenting such information. While previous works often focused and tailored the documentation for supervised-style datasets (e.g., "Is there a label or target associated with each instance?", "How was the data associated with each instance acquired?" from Datasheets, and "What are the demographic characteristics of the annotators and annotation guideline developers?" from Data Statements) we call for more tailored documentation of large-scale pretraining corpora ${ }^{7}$ This work offers a superset of the automatic full-corpus analyses proposed by Dodge et al. (2021); Gao et al. (2020), with several additions, categorization, and programmatic interface, allowing better understanding of the content of current and future large text corpora.

Grounding Models to their Training Data Unlike other factors of language model training, such as model architecture or optimizer choice, training data comes in the same natural language format as language model's outputs and thus can be measured and described in all the same ways. As such, the data offers a unique opportunity for grounding models. For instance, a model's ability to recall factual knowledge is derived from its training data (Jiang et al., 2020; Elazar et al., 2021a). On the other hand, models often perform better on frequent occurrences (Razeghi et al. 2022a; McCoy et al. 2023), and on documents similar to models' training data (Longpre et al. 2023). The path to a holistic comprehension of model behavior is through the data, which requires an infrastructure investment to access big datasets and the right abstraction of data attributes.

## 6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we propose WIMBD, a framework for processing and analyzing large text corpora. Using WIMBD, we study ten different corpora that were used to train language models (or vision and language models, such as Stable Diffusion). We uncover interesting insights about these corpora using sixteen different analyses across four aspects: high-level statistics, data quality, communityand society- relevant measurements, and cross-data analysis. For instance, the most common source of texts for the $L A I O N-2 B$-en dataset are the commercial websites Pinterest, Shopify, SlidePlayer, Amazon, and eBay. Regarding data quality, we find that about $50 \%$ of RedPajama and LAION-2Ben's documents are duplicates. In addition, we find that many evaluation benchmarks, including several from GLUE and SuperGLUE, such as WSC, WIC, and RTE, are contaminated due to their appearance in corpora such as RedPajama. Besides the analyses, WIMBD offers an extendable platform for reproducing our analyses on other corpora, developing new ones, and answering research questions about data. We release all the code and artifacts for WIMBD to encourage researchers to adopt and extend our framework and analyze existing and new corpora.[^4]
