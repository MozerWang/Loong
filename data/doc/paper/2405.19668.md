#### Abstract

Despite the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, recent studies indicate that they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can render their defense mechanisms ineffective. However, previous jailbreak research has frequently been constrained by limited universality, suboptimal efficiency, and a reliance on manual crafting. In response, we rethink the approach to jailbreaking LLMs and formally define three essential properties from the attacker's perspective, which contributes to guiding the design of jailbreak methods. We further introduce AutoBreach, a novel method for jailbreaking LLMs that requires only black-box access. Inspired by the versatility of wordplay, AutoBreach employs a wordplayguided mapping rule sampling strategy to generate a variety of universal mapping rules for creating adversarial prompts. This generation process leverages LLMs' automatic summarization and reasoning capabilities, thus alleviating the manual burden. To boost jailbreak success rates, we further suggest sentence compression and chain-of-thought-based mapping rules to correct errors and wordplay misinterpretations in target LLMs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage mapping rule optimization strategy that initially optimizes mapping rules before querying target LLMs to enhance the efficiency of AutoBreach. AutoBreach can efficiently identify security vulnerabilities across various LLMs, including three proprietary models: Claude-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, and two LLMs' web platforms: Bingchat, GPT-4 Web, achieving an average success rate of over $80 \%$ with fewer than 10 queries.


## 1 Introduction

The development of large language models (LLMs) has conferred considerable advantages upon human society. However, these benefits are also accompanied by vulnerabilities that emerge within LLMs, such as jailbreaking attacks [3, 6, 19, 25, 27, 32], which can induce LLMs to generate malicious or harmful responses. Due to extensive potential for harm, jailbreaks have been ranked by OWASP [16] as the most significant security risk for LLM applications. Therefore, it is crucial to examine jailbreak attacks as a means to assess the security and reliability of LLMs.

Existing jailbreaks mainly fall into two categories: prompt-level [3, 8, 13], and token-level [31, 32] strategies. Prompt-level strategies can be categorized into role-playing and wordplay. Essentially, these strategies revolve around identifying a mapping rule: either finding a scenario that can disguise the jailbreaking goals (harmful questions), or making reasonable transformations to the jailbreaking goals text. However, role-playing requires customizing a scenario for each jailbreaking goal (lacks universality), further increasing queries and computational costs. Wordplay uses the same mapping rule for various jailbreak goals by manipulating text directly (e.g., encryption and encoding) without scenario-specific setups, thus enhancing their universality [2, 21, 23, 25]. However, it relies on[^0]

manually crafting a static mapping rule, thereby making it easy to circumvent and amplifying the labor burden. Token-level strategies involve optimizing an input token set by conducting hundreds of thousands of queries on target LLMs [3, 31], significantly limiting their practical use.

In this paper, we involve some valuable considerations from an attacker's perspective: minimizing effort while maximizing outcomes. Firstly, to enhance the utilization of mapping rules, jailbreaking methods should possess universality, which emphasizes that the same mapping rule should effectively serve multiple jailbreaking goals and be applicable across different LLM application interfaces, whether API or web. Secondly, responding to easily filtered manual mapping rules, it should exhibit adaptability to cope with the strengthening of LLMs' defense mechanisms. Moreover, jailbreaking methods should also possess efficiency, which means that the queries to LLMs should be minimized to reduce computational overhead. With these properties, we can maximize the utility of the mapping rule while minimizing computational costs.

However, satisfying these properties exists two challenges: (1) Regarding universality, a key limitation is the inability to modify system prompts of target LLMs, which is effective via API, not on web platforms. Recent research [9, 29] has indicated that attacking LLMs without modifying system prompts can significantly increase the difficulty of successful attacks. Moreover, the customized scenario for a jailbreaking goal is difficult to apply ${ }^{1}$. Hence, the first challenge is finding universally applicable mapping rules without modifying the target LLM's system prompts. (2) For adaptability and efficiency, jailbreaks should automatically update mapping rules for successful attacks with acceptable queries. Thus, the second challenge is designing an optimization strategy that quickly and automatically identifies LLM vulnerabilities.

To address the challenges above, we propose AutoBreach, a novel method utilizing multi-LLMs for automatically jailbreaking that only requires black-box access to target LLMs with a few queries, as shown in Fig. 1. To enhance universality and adaptability, we introduce wordplay-guided mapping rule sampling that generates innovative and diverse wordplay mapping rules. Specifically, inspired by the universality of wordplay strategies [2, 21, 23, 25], AutoBreach leverages the inductive reasoning of an LLM (Attacker) about wordplay to generate a variety of universal mapping rules, requiring no human intervention. Furthermore, due to errors from long sentences and misinterpretations of wordplay by target LLMs, we propose sentence compression and chain-of-thought-based (CoTbased) mapping rules which refine jailbreak goals and enhance the comprehension of target LLMs to enhance jailbreak success rates (JSR). To ensure efficiency, we propose a two-stage mapping rule optimization. The core idea is the interaction between the roles of Attacker and Supervisor to execute an initial optimization stage. By this stage before iteratively refining the mapping rule through querying target LLMs, which efficiently enhances performance and reduces queries.

We validate the effectiveness of AutoBreach by conducting comprehensive experiments with the common LLMs (e.g., Claude-3 [1], GPT-4 Turbo [15]). Our results demonstrate that AutoBreach effectively generates mapping rules that facilitate successful jailbreaking, achieving an average jailbreak success rate of over $\mathbf{8 0 \%}$ across diverse models while maintaining fewer than $\mathbf{1 0}$ queries, which also exhibits high transferability across different models. Moreover, to evaluate the robustness of AutoBreach on multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), we input adversarial prompts into MLLMs alongside irrelevant images, with the results indicating our method has little impact on image modalities. This indicates the adversarial prompts generated by AutoBreach are steadily effective against MLLMs.[^1]

## 2 Related Work

Token-level jailbreaks. These attacks typically optimize adversarial text prompts based on gradients to jailbreak LLMs [12, 28, 31, 32]. Token-level jailbreaks are usually optimized on white-box LLMs and can exploit transferability to jailbreak black-box LLMs. Unlike traditional text-based adversarial attacks [14, 28], these methods generally optimize directly in the token space rather than the token feature space for transferability. As the first adversarial attack [32] to jailbreak an LLM and trigger harmful behavior, it optimizes by randomly selecting a token position in each iteration, aiming to start the target LLM with an affirmative response. However, this approach significantly degrades performance under the integration of perplexity filters. [31] proposes an interpretable textual jailbreak to address this issue. Nevertheless, these methods typically require a large number of queries, which limits their practicality.

Prompt-level jailbreaks. Due to the issues summarized above, a new type of jailbreak attack, prompt-level jailbreaks [3, 13, 18, 23], has recently emerged. These attacks typically use semanticallymeaningful deception and social engineering to elicit objectionable content from LLMs. Depending on the specific jailbreaking strategy employed, they can be broadly classified into wordplay [23, 25] and role-playing strategies $[3,8,13]$. Role-playing guides the LLMs to produce specific textual responses by constructing scenarios. This method manipulates semantics and sentiment to influence the LLMs' output, causing it to generate text that fulfills the jailbreaking goals under specific contexts. In contrast, wordplay focuses on technical manipulations such as encryption and encoding, making it more versatile than the former, as it does not require the construction of specific scenarios for particular jailbreak goals. However, wordplay usually requires manual crafting. Unlike previous studies (as shown in Tab. 1), AutoBreach generates a variety of universal mapping rules automatically through wordplay-guided optimization via multi-LLMs.

## 3 Jailbreak Properties

Let $Q=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{x}_{n}\right\}$ denote a set of harmful questions (jailbreak goals). We can obtain the optimized prompts $P=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \mapsto \boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p} \mid \boldsymbol{f}_{i}, i=1, \ldots, n\right\}$, here, $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ represents the $i$-th optimized prompt, and $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ denotes the corresponding mapping rule. For the sake of simplicity, let $\mathcal{F}_{i}$ denote the mapping function, $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}=\mathcal{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)$. By leveraging $P$ to query the target LLM $\mathcal{T}$, we are able to derive a set of responses $R=\left\{\boldsymbol{r}_{1}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{r}_{n}\right\}$. Therefore, jailbreak attacks can be formalized as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\underset{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}}{\arg \max } S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{r}_{i}\right), \quad \text { with } \boldsymbol{r}_{i}=\mathcal{T}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{r}_{i}\right) \in[1,10]$ represents the judge score, typically obtained from an LLM, such as GPT-4. When $S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{r}_{i}\right)=10$, it indicates a successful jailbreak; otherwise, it denotes a failure. Through Eq. (1), we can derive the optimized prompt $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$, which successfully performs a jailbreak on $\mathcal{T}$. In this paper, we involve some practical considerations from an attacker's perspective as follows.

Universality. For attackers, after expending computational resources and capital to optimize a mapping rule $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$, there is a strong preference for the $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ to be applicable across various jailbreak goals or different interfaces of LLMs. This universality can effectively reduce the overhead associated with optimizing mapping rules.

Definition 1 (Universality). Consider an LLM equipped with interfaces in a black-box manner, denoted by $\mathcal{T}$. Assume that $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}=\mathcal{F}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)$ effectively enables a jailbreak on $\mathcal{T}$. Then, for any $\boldsymbol{x}_{j}$ where $j \neq i$, the score $S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}, \mathcal{T}\left(\mathcal{F}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right)\right)\right)=10$ is consistently satisfied. Different interfaces do as well.

Formally, Definition 1 articulates more granular requirements for the mapping rule $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$, which achieves universality across different jailbreak goals and interfaces (including both API and web services). This highlights unresolved challenges in most previous research.

Adaptability. With advancements in the defensive mechanisms of LLMs, manually crafted static mapping rules have become easy to circumvent. This highlights the imperative: current methodologies should not rely solely on static mapping rules but must dynamically adapt to new challenges.

Definition 2 (Adaptability). Given an $L L M \mathcal{T}$ which updates to $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$, the corresponding mapping rule $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ also evolves to $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\prime}$. Despite these changes, $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\prime}$ successfully facilitates a jailbreak, i.e., $S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{r}_{i}^{\prime} \mid\right.$ $\left.\boldsymbol{r}_{i}^{\prime}=\mathcal{T}^{\prime}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}^{\prime}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)\right)=10$, where $\boldsymbol{r}_{i}^{\prime}$ is the response of $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$.

Intuitively, Definition 2 underscores the critical issue of continually identifying new mapping rules $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\prime}$ to adapt to the evolving defensive mechanisms of LLMs. A natural approach would be to utilize the

Figure 1: AutoBreach Overview. Stage 1: Attacker employs inductive reasoning on wordplay to generate chain-of-thought mapping rules that transform the jailbreak goals. Supervisor then evaluates these mapping rules to foster improved generation. Stage 2: Mapper first utilizes sentence compression to clarify the core intent of the jailbreak goals, then transforms it using the mapping rules. Evaluator subsequently scores the outcome to determine the success of this jailbreak.

gradients of LLMs to optimize adversarial prompts for this purpose; however, this is nearly unfeasible in practice, as existing commercial LLMs are almost entirely black-box.

Efficiency. Efficiency is a crucial consideration for attackers in jailbreak attacks. Due to the computational and financial costs associated with querying both open-source and closed-source LLMs, enhancing efficiency can effectively reduce these material expenses.

In summary, we aim to maximize the utility of jailbreak methods from an attacker's perspective, presenting a more challenging problem than those addressed in previous studies.

## 4 Methodology

To achieve the above properties, we propose AutoBreach, a novel approach utilizing multiple LLMs for automated jailbreaking, requiring only black-box access to target LLMs with a few queries, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the following, we first present the problem formulation in Sec. 4.1 and then introduce the algorithm details of AutoBreach in Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.3.

### 4.1 Problem Formulation

To alleviate the burden of manual crafting (i.e., adaptability), we utilize an LLM to generate mapping rules. Formally, we define an Attacker $\mathcal{A}$, which automatically generates different mapping rules $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$. Subsequently, we obtain $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ through $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}=\mathcal{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)$. To enable automatic scoring, we introduce an Evaluator $\mathcal{E}$. According to Eq. (1) and Definition 1, the problem can be formulated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\underset{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}=\mathcal{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)}{\arg \max } \mathcal{E}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \mathcal{T}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)\right), \quad \text { s.t. } \forall \boldsymbol{x}_{j} \text { and } j \neq i, S\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}, \mathcal{T}\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right)\right)\right)=10 \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are consistent in Eq. (1). Concerning the optimization of $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ in Eq. (2), we employ the prompt-based automatic iterative refinement strategy to optimize the mapping rule iteratively through queries, as motivated by [3]. Specifically, by utilizing the scores assigned by the Evaluator $\mathcal{E}$ to mapping rules, we create gradients in the language space as a substitute for the feature space. Subsequently, the Attacker $\mathcal{A}$ can iteratively optimize the objective function (2) through gradient descent. Utilizing Eq. (2), we can derive mapping rules that are both universal and adaptive.

To ensure efficiency, we revisit Eq. (2) and observe that the number of queries is determined by $\mathcal{T}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)$. In other words, $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ necessitates repeated queries to $\mathcal{T}$ to conduct iterative optimizations for a successful jailbreak. Hence, obtaining a satisfactory $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ prior to querying $\mathcal{T}$ can significantly reduce the number of queries to $\mathcal{T}$, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process. Formally, we can construct a function $\mathcal{O}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)$ to effectively enhance the quality of $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ before querying $\mathcal{T}$.

### 4.2 Wordplay-Guided Mapping Rule Sampling

As discussed in Sec. 2, wordplay strategies exhibit notable universality [23, 25]. Leveraging this, we introduce a wordplay-guided mapping rule sampling (WMFS) technique designed to inspire novel wordplay strategies from existing ones. Specifically, we inject several validated wordplay rules into
the system prompt of Attacker $\mathcal{A}$. Leveraging the inductive reasoning capabilities of Attacker, we derive novel and diverse mapping rules. The method can be formalized as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{WMFS}\left(F^{w}\right)=\mathcal{I}\left(\operatorname{Inject}\left(P_{a}, F^{w}\right)\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $F^{w}$ denotes the set of some validated wordplay rules, and Inject represents the injection function, which embeds $F^{w}$ into the system prompt $P_{a}$. The function $\mathcal{I}$ symbolizes the inductive reasoning process of the Attacker $\mathcal{A}$, which is responsible for generating novel mapping rules.

After obtaining the novel mapping rules, a natural question arises: how can we transform jailbreak goal texts according to these rules, i.e., how to construct $\mathcal{F}$ ? Initially, we attempt to solve this problem using Attacker $\mathcal{A}$, but the results are suboptimal, as shown in Tab. 5. To address this problem, we introduce a new LLM role, Mapper $\mathcal{M}$, specifically transforming jailbreak goal texts according to the generated mapping rules, i.e., it performs the same function as $\mathcal{F}$.

Although introducing the Mapper alleviates some issues, it also introduces new challenges: (1) Jailbreak goals are generally complete sentences, but inaccuracies can occur when the Mapper transforms these sentences, especially with longer ones. (2) When responding to mapped prompts $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$, the target LLM may misinterpret it, leading to off-topic answers. Therefore, we further propose two solutions to address these problems:

Sentence compression (SC). Inspired by [26], this approach utilizes an LLM equipped with a note compression prompt to condense note texts into a single, special token and demonstrate high semantic consistency. This idea is incorporated into AutoBreach to tackle challenge 1. In particular, we enhance Mapper by incorporating text compression prompts $F^{s}$, enabling it to implement sentence compression, i.e., $\operatorname{Inject}\left(P_{m}, F^{s}\right)$, where $P_{m}$ is the system prompt of Mapper. This strategy enhances clarity and preserves critical information prior to transforming jailbreak goals. For instance, "Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb" is compressed to "bomb-making", as illustrated on the left of Fig. 2.

CoT-based mapping rule. Another challenge is that the target LLM fundamentally struggles to fully understand the corresponding mapping rule, leading to incorrect responses. Motivated by the contributions of chain-of-thought (CoT) in prompt engineering [22], we augment the Attacker by injecting a CoT $F^{c}$ to its system prompt $P_{a}, \operatorname{Inject}\left(P_{a}, F^{c}\right)$, enabling

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_f8e98eb28fc4ba019f27g-05.jpg?height=338&width=724&top_left_y=1197&top_left_x=1031)
it to generate mapping rules $\boldsymbol{f}$ that incorporate thought chains. This can be articulated as

$\mathcal{A}\left(P_{a}\right)=\boldsymbol{f}^{c}$, where $\boldsymbol{f}^{c}$ is the mapping rule with CoT, as shown on the right of Fig. 2. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of the target LLM's responses, as presented in Tab. 5 .

### 4.3 Two-stage Mapping Rule Optimization

In this section, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the jailbreaking method by refining the optimization strategy. Specifically, inspired by [13], which suggests pruning off-topic mapping rules before querying target LLMs. We recognize that the mapping rules $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ sampled by Attacker $\mathcal{A}$ are not always efficient. Consequently, we propose a two-stage mapping rule optimization (TMFO) approach. This strategy recommends an initial optimization phase (Stage 1) for the sampled mapping rules before engaging in iterative optimization with target LLMs (Stage 2), i.e., the process of $\mathcal{O}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)$ as mentioned in Sec. 4.1. This process advances to stage 2 only upon achieving satisfactory mapping rules, i.e., we effectively optimize mapping rules before iteratively accessing target LLMs, thereby significantly reducing the number of queries to target LLMs.

Formally, for the optimization of stage 1, we can also employ LLM supervision for automation, similar to stage 2. However, as shown in Eq. (2), the Evaluator $\mathcal{E}$ requires responses from the target LLM $\mathcal{T}$ to score, thus precluding its use. Therefore, we introduce a new LLM role, the Supervisor $\mathcal{R}$, which is employed to assess the appropriateness of $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}$ (detailed prompt templates are provided in Appendix A). Similar to $\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{R}$ also uses a scoring method, with a perfect score being 10 points. For Stage 1, the optimization objective is to maximize the score during the interaction between $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{A}$, denoted as arg max $\mathcal{R}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)$. The overall optimization objective can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overbrace{\underset{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}=\mathcal{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)}{\arg \max } \mathcal{E}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \mathcal{T}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)\right)}^{\text {Stage 2 }}, \quad \overbrace{\text { s.t. } \mathcal{R}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{p}\right)=10}^{\text {Stage 1 }}, \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

In practice, we first optimize robust mapping rules in Stage 1, followed by querying the target LLM $\mathcal{T}$ in Stage 2 to iteratively refine the mapping rules until jailbreaking is successfully achieved.

System prompt. The prompt templates for all roles (Attacker, Evaluator, Supervisor, and Mapper) are fully presented in Appendix A. Notably, we have not altered the target LLMs' system prompts, which results in our method maintaining a high jailbreak success rate on their web interface.

## 5 Experiments

We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AutoBreach. Initially, we perform direct jailbreaking attacks on various LLMs in Sec. 5.1. Subsequently, we evaluate the universality and transferability of our method, i.e., the generalization capabilities of mapping rules within and across LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments, such as ablation studies, to thoroughly explore the capabilities of AutoBreach in Sec. 5.3. More results are available in Appendix B.1.

### 5.1 Experimental Settings

Datasets and metrics. To evaluate the efficacy of AutoBreach, we utilize the subset of AdvBench benchmark [32] that contains 50 prompts asking for harmful information across 32 categories created by [3]. For metrics, we employ two forms: automated evaluation and human assessment (user study). Automated evaluation involves using GPT-4 Turbo to evaluate "detailed and fully jailbroken responses" consistent with baselines, except for the GCG [32], which differs significantly in setting from other baselines. Therefore, we adopt its default evaluation criteria. For the user study, we enlist volunteers to conduct a user study based on the criteria of whether the responses from LLMs are harmful and whether they align with the jailbreaking goals. In addition to the jailbreaking success rate, we also provide the metric: the number of queries. To ensure fairness in comparison and to reduce economic costs, we set a uniform maximum of 30 queries for all methods except for GCG.

Baselines. We compare AutoBreach with three types of baselines: (1) Token-level strategy: GCG attack [32]; (2) Role-playing strategy: PAIR [3], TAP [13], DeepInception [8], and GPTfuzzer [24]; (3) Wordplay strategy: CIPHER [25]. All baselines are configured according to the optimal performance settings reported in their respective papers. As models will evolve over time, we perform all evaluations during April 10th to 20th, 2024.

Language models. For target LLMs, we consider two open-source models: llama-2-7B-chat (Llama2 [20]), Vicuna-13B-v1.5 (Vicuna [5]); three closed-source model APIs: gpt-4-0124-preview (GPT-4 Turbo), gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 (GPT-3.5), claude-3-sonnet (Claude-3), and two web platform: Bingchat, GPT4-Web. In AutoBreach, all roles utilize GPT-4 Turbo. We also attempt to replace the attackers in TAP and PAIR with GPT-4 Turbo to maintain consistency across experiments. However, we find that this significantly degrades their performance (further discussions and experimental results are presented in Appendix B.1.1). Therefore, we retain their default settings to achieve optimal results.

Figure 3: An initial harmful question, initially rejected by LLMs, is processed by AutoBreach which clarifies the core intent through SC. It then generates a mapping rule to transform the core intent, ultimately producing adversarial prompts capable of successfully bypassing the safeguards.

Table 3: Universality of jailbreaks.

### 5.2 Experimental Results

Effectiveness. Tab. 2 summarizes the performance comparison between AutoBreach and baselines across various target LLMs, including jailbreak success rates and the number of queries. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 display some successful jailbreak examples. We can draw the following conclusions. First, compared to baselines, AutoBreach demonstrates enhanced effectiveness. Across various target LLMs, AutoBreach consistently approaches optimal performance in JSR. It achieves the highest jailbreak success rate of $96 \%$ on Claude-3, which is equipped with stringent defense mechanisms. Overall, AutoBreach attains an average success rate of $82.28 \%$. Second, AutoBreach demonstrates commendable performance across different interfaces of the same model (such as API and web interfaces), due to its robust universality. Notably, as illustrated by the results with GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 Web, the performance on web interfaces generally falls below that on API interfaces. This may suggest web interfaces are equipped with stronger or more comprehensive defense mechanisms. Third, while enhancing effectiveness, AutoBreach also exhibits greater efficiency, achieving the lowest number of queries across nearly all baselines. Notably, it records a minimal query count of 2.93 when attacking GPT-4 Turbo.

The aforementioned results demonstrate that AutoBreach can automatically and efficiently identify security vulnerabilities across various interfaces of LLMs. This capability is attributed to AutoBreach's wordplay-guided mapping rules and optimization strategies, which endow it with universality, adaptability, and efficiency.

Universality. To validate the universality of AutoBreach, we specifically select the mapping rules that require the fewest queries for each target LLM (indicating higher susceptibility to successful attacks) from both AutoBreach and baseline methods. Subsequently, we utilize these mapping rules to attack the corresponding target LLMs with various jailbreaking goals from the AdvBench subset, as verified in Tab. 3. On one hand, when the system prompts of target LLMs remain unaltered, the[^2]

Table 4: Transferability of jailbreaks. We evaluate whether the mapping rules generated on Claude3 and GPT-4 Turbo can be transferred to other targets based on the jailbreak success rate (\%).

| Method | Model | Open-source |  | Closed-source |  |  | $\frac{\text { Web interface }}{\text { Bingchat }}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  | $\overline{\text { Vicuna }}$ | Llama-2 | $\overline{\text { GPT-3.5 }}$ | Claude-3 | GPT-4 Turbo |  |
| PAIR | Claude-3 | 55.0 | 0 | 25.0 | 40.0 | 40.0 <br> - | 30.0 |
|  | GPT-4 Turbo | 45.0 | 0 | 35.0 |  |  | 35.0 |
| TAP | Claude-3 | 60.0 | 0 | 30.0 | 45.0 | 35.0 <br> - | 30.0 |
|  | GPT-4 Turbo | 45.0 | 0 | 45.0 |  |  | 40.0 |
| AutoBreach | Claude-3 | 40.0 | 15.0 | 30.0 | $\overline{-}$ | $\mathbf{5 0 . 0}$ | 45.0 |
|  | GPT-4 Turbo | 45.0 | 10.0 | 45.0 |  |  | 40.0 |

performance of CIPHER is weaker than the results in the original paper, which corroborates the findings described in [9, 29]. This underscores the impact of system prompts on the security of target LLMs, as discussed in [29]. Furthermore, this indirectly reinforces the significance of the universality we emphasize. On the other hand, we observe that AutoBreach continues to exhibit strong universality, attributed to the efficacy of the optimization strategies we have devised, which is further elaborated in Tab. 5 .

Cross-model transferability. We then study the transferability of the generated mapping rules across different target LLMs. Specifically, we initially select 20 mapping rules against Claude-3 and GPT-4 Trubo from AutoBreach and the baselines at random. Subsequently, we test the jailbreak attack rates of these mapping rules on a subset of AdvBench against other LLMs. Furthermore, to eliminate the randomness in conclusions due to small-scale data, we repeat the experiment ten times. If a jailbreak is successful in any of these ten attempts, we consider it a successful transfer. We present the results in Tab. 4. It can be observed that, compared to other approaches, AutoBreach demonstrates superior transferability. Moreover, overall, the mapping rules generated by Claude-3 appear to exhibit enhanced transferability. This is due to the mapping rules' universality guided by the wordplay of AutoBreach, allowing the same mapping rule to be effective across different target LLMs.

#### Abstract

Ablation studies. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the additional roles and proposed strategies. Tab. 5 shows the number of queries and JSR of AdvBreach across different ablation settings. Beyond the original experimental setup (Eq. (2)), we introduce a jailbreak method using only a single supervisor. Keeping other settings constant, relying on a single supervisor effectively reduces the number of queries while increasing the JSR by $16 \%$. Integrating the Mapper led to a further improvement in AutoBreach's JSR by $22 \%$. With the additional implementation of sentence compression and CoT-based mapping rule strategies, AutoBreach's performance improves the most, achieving a $38 \%$ increase, with a minimal number of queries (2.93). This phenomenon indicates that AutoBreach's different roles and strategies can effectively enhance its performance.

User study. Due to potential errors in LLM evaluations [8], we invite volunteers to conduct a user study, where they manually assess the experimental results based on whether the responses from LLMs are harmful and whether they align with the jailbreaking goals, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). First,

| Supervisor | Mapper | Sentence compression | CoT-based | Queries | JSR (\%) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $x$ | $x$ | $x$ | $x$ | 14.56 | 52 |
| $\checkmark$ | $x$ | $x$ | $x$ | $8.38(\downarrow 6.18)$ | $68(\uparrow 16)$ |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $x$ | $x$ | $7.19(\downarrow 7.37)$ | $74(\uparrow 22)$ |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $x$ | $4.25(\downarrow 10.31)$ | $82(\uparrow 30)$ |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $2.93(\downarrow 11.63)$ | $90(\uparrow 38)$ |

we confirm that there is indeed some error in LLM evaluations, as results generally decline after manual assessment. Second, even with this decline, AutoBreach still achieves higher jailbreaking success rates compared to baselines, with the highest success rate reaching $72 \%$ on GPT-3.5. Third, the results on Bingchat are generally low, which corroborates the above discussions: the web interface may have more comprehensive defense mechanisms.

Experiments on multi-modal LLMs. We conduct experiments on MLLMs to further explore AutoBreach. We employ four settings: natural images (from COCO [10]), Gaussian noise, pure black images, and pure white images, to evaluate (human assessment) the robustness of the generated adversarial prompts against irrelevant images against GPT-4 Turbo. The experimental screenshots and results are illustrated in Appendix and Fig 5(b) respectively. We observe that the generated adversarial prompts (on GPT-4 Turbo) are largely unaffected by irrelevant images. Notably, pure black images even improve the jailbreak success rate by $4 \%$. This indicates the adversarial prompts generated by AutoBreach are equally effective in MLLMs due to their universality.

Analysis of different mapping rules. We further analyze the number of successful jailbreaks produced by different mapping rules in AutoBreach, as illustrated in 5(c). Note that here we only summarize the results obtained the target LLM, GPT-4 Turbo. We observe that the 'letter reversing' method achieves the highest success count with 21 , followed by 'Caesar cipher' with 12 . The methods like 'letter splitting' and 'split and shuffle' rank lower. This experimental phenomenon aligns with intuition; like humans, GPT-4 Turbo is more adept at understanding simpler mapping rules, a trait that can be exploited for jailbreaking. This also suggests that future work could explore simple yet effective mapping rules to jailbreak LLMs.

## 6 Conclusion

This paper rethinks current jailbreaking efforts and identifies three properties (universality, adaptability and efficiency) to maximize the efficacy of jailbreak methodologies. Based on these properties, the study further proposes that AutoBreach generates wordplay-based mapping rules guided by a twostage optimization to automatically jailbreak black-box LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AutoBreach in uncovering security vulnerabilities in LLMs, demonstrating excellent universality and transferability. Furthermore, the robustness of AutoBreach against irrelevant images demonstrates its practicality in MLLMs.
