#### Abstract

This paper revisits the standard pretrain-then-finetune paradigm used in computer vision for visual recognition tasks. Typically, state-of-the-art foundation models are pretrained using large scale (weakly) supervised datasets with billions of images. We introduce an additional prepretraining stage that is simple and uses the self-supervised MAE technique to initialize the model. While MAE has only been shown to scale with the size of models, we find that it scales with the size of the training dataset as well. Thus, our MAE-based pre-pretraining scales with both model and data size making it applicable for training foundation models. Pre-pretraining consistently improves both the model convergence and the downstream transfer performance across a range of model scales (millions to billions of parameters), and dataset sizes (millions to billions of images). We measure the effectiveness of pre-pretraining on 10 different visual recognition tasks spanning image classification, video recognition, object detection, low-shot classification and zero-shot recognition. Our largest model achieves new state-of-the-art results on iNaturalist-18 (91.7\%), ImageNet-ReaL (91.1\%), 1-shot ImageNet-1k (63.6\%), and zero-shot transfer on Food101 (96.2\%). Our study reveals that model initialization plays a significant role, even for web-scale pretraining with billions of images, and our models are available publicly.


## 1. Introduction

The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm in visual recognition has enabled high performance visual recognition models across a range of tasks such as image classification $[52,59,70]$, video action recognition [25, 27, 28], object detection [11, 90], 3D etc. Typically, pretraining consists of training a model using a pretraining task on large scale data. The resulting pretrained models learn general purpose visual representations that can be used for a range of target tasks,[^0]

often with limited labeled data, by transfer learning.

In this paper, we show that an initial stage of prepretraining before the standard pretraining task can improve vision models across a variety of different tasks. Our method combines two common pretraining tasks in vision: (1) weakly supervised pretraining that uses weak, often noisy, signals such as text or image hashtags as supervision, and (2) self-supervised pretraining that only uses the data without additional supervision. Both forms of pretraining start training with a randomly initialized model and have proven effective at learning general purpose vision models. While there have been attempts to combine both these forms of pretraining $[54,69]$, they are typically used independently in the pretrain-then-finetune two stage paradigm [23, 70, 85].

In this work we explore the combination of self- and weakly-supervised learning in a simple pre-pretraining
framework, as follows. We first begin with the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [33] self-supervised learning technique to pre-pretrain vision models without using any labels. After initializing from the pre-pretrained model, we use standard weakly supervised pretraining on billions of images with noisy labels. We perform a large-scale empirical study to measure the effectiveness of pre-pretraining on 10 different visual recognition tasks spanning image classification, video recognition, object detection, low-shot classification and zero-shot recognition. Our study reveals that pre-pretrain initialization improves the performance for the weakly supervised models, and this improvement holds even at billion scale weakly labeled data, and across vision tasks (Figure 1). It also improves the model convergence during pretraining, leading to an efficient way of training large scale vision models. Pre-pretrain further enjoys the computational efficiency of the MAE approach, making it simple and scalable. Finally, we show that by using pre-pretraining, both self-supervised learning and weakly supervised learning can be combined for improved model performance for billion-scale data.

Pre-pretrain is related to 'intermediate finetuning' [5, 50] which introduces a stage after pretraining to better align the pretrained features with the downstream task using labeled data. In contrast, pre-pretrain serves as a better way to initialize a model before pretraining. Since we leverage MAE for pre-pretraining, we do not need additional information or labels for this stage and can re-use the pretraining data. This makes pre-pretrain convenient and simple to use with existing pretraining datasets.

Our study on large-scale pre-pretraining reveals that model initialization plays a significant role, even for webscale pretraining, and pre-pretraining is a simple and promising technique in that direction. In particular, we show that (i) MAE not only scales with model size as shown in [33], but also with the size of the training data (Figure 2). (ii) Pre-pretraining improves both the model convergence and the final downstream performance for different sized models (millions to billions of parameters) trained on different sized datasets (millions to billions of images). (iii) Using pre-pretraining combines the benefits of both self-supervised learning and large scale weakly-supervised learning, and our models achieve excellent performance on a variety of different visual recognition tasks (Figure 1). Most prominently, our model sets new state-of-the-art results on image classification on iNaturalist-18 (91.7\%) and ImageNet-ReaL ( $91.1 \%$ ), 1-shot ImageNet-1k classification ( $63.6 \%$ ), and zero-shot transfer on Food-101 (96.2\%).

## 2. Related Work

Supervised pretraining of transferrable representations on large labeled datasets [21, 43, 63] and employing them for downstream recognition tasks, has emerged as a powerful approach in computer vision. It has spurred rapid progress on various tasks including image classification [22, 57, 60], object detection/segmentation [29, 62], image captioning [45, 82] and video action recognition [13, 24, 68]. While useful, such representations are often limited by the scale and diversity of the supervision in the pretraining datasets. Hence, recent work has probed the effectiveness, robustness, and fairness of these representations [1, 20, 40, 44, 61, 66, 74]. Self-supervised pretraining is a promising alternative to learn these representation without relying on large welllabeled datasets. Initial works focused on reconstructions methods [78] before moving to other pretraining tasks such as solving jigsaw puzzles [55], constrastive learning [15, 34] or joint embedding approaches $[3,4,11,12,31,90]$. With the advent of Vision Transformers [23], approaches based on reconstructions such as $[5,33,80]$ got renewed interest for their simplicity and state of the art performance. Of particular interest to us is MAE [33] for its state of the art performance on many transfer tasks [25, 28, 33, 46, 75] and its computational efficiency. Given the lack of supervision during pretraining, these representations often require significant finetuning to align to downstream tasks.

Weakly supervised pretraining (WSP) is a middle-ground between supervised and self-supervised pretraining. Instead of ignoring annotations completely as in self-supervised pretraining, or requiring exhaustive labels as in supervised pretraining, WSP relies on the large quantity of "free" annotation available on the internet. These annotations occur as image-text pairs [59, 65], where the text can additionally be processed to produce pseudo labels. Of particular interest to us is the latter, i.e. approaches which leverage multi-label classification on noisy labels [27, 52, 70, 85] which have shown state of the art fine-tuning performance, and at the same time can be adapted using image-text data to gain zeroshot capabilities [86]. In this work, we explore WSP in conjunction with self-supervised pre-pretraining, and show faster convergence and stronger performance.

## 3. Setup

Our goal is to empirically study the effectiveness of selfsupervised pre-pretraining as a precursor to billion scale weakly supervised pretraining for representation learning. Given the simplicity and efficiency of Masked AutoEncoding (MAE) [33], we leverage it as the self-supervised prepretraining approach. Our study shows that MAE scales with the size of the pretraining dataset and model size, and combining it with weak supervision improves large scale vision models. Additionally, such a combination leads to faster convergence and is a simple, scalable way to learn visual representations at scale. We describe our setup and the approaches in detail next.

Architecure. We use the Vision Transformer (ViT) [23] architecture as the visual encoder for all our experiments. ViTs employ minimal vision-specific inductive biases com-
bined with the standard transformer architecture [77], and yet have emerged as an architecture of choice for a wide variety of visual and multimodal recognition tasks $[2,28,85]$. We train ViT models at various scales in terms of number of parameters, including ViT-B (86M), ViT-L (307M), and ViT-H (632M). We also train on larger 1.9B and 6.5B parameter ViT models, which we call ViT-2B and ViT-6.5B, respectively (Table 1). As is common practice [23, 85], we train models of sizes ViT-B, ViT-L with a patch size of 16 and larger models with a patch size of 14 . We pretrain with a $224 \times 224$ resolution for all models.

| Arch. | Layers | Embed | MLP | Heads | Params |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ViT-B | 12 | 768 | 3072 | 12 | $86 \mathrm{M}$ |
| ViT-L | 24 | 1024 | 4096 | 16 | $307 \mathrm{M}$ |
| ViT-H | 32 | 1280 | 5120 | 16 | $632 \mathrm{M}$ |
| ViT-2B | 24 | 2560 | 10240 | 32 | $1.89 \mathrm{~B}$ |
| ViT-6.5B | 32 | 4096 | 16384 | 32 | $6.44 \mathrm{~B}$ |

Table 1: Model architecture details. To ensure we were able to scale models out further than ViT-H easily, we decided to scale models along the same lines as GPT-3 [10], which has proven to be successful for NLP.

Pre-pretraining (MAE) [33] learns visual representations from image datasets without using any labels. We choose this approach as it is simple to implement and scales very effectively with large ViT model sizes due to patch dropping as described next. MAE randomly masks $75 \%$ of an image and trains the model to reconstruct the masked input image by minimizing the pixel reconstruction error. The target pixel values for a given patch are normalized by the mean and standard deviation of all pixels in it. Coupled with the ViT architecture, MAE can be trained by only processing the $25 \%$ unmasked image patches. A separate, smaller, decoder is then used to reconstruct the missing part of the input. This asymmetrical design makes training the encoder extremely efficient, allowing for scaling visual encoder sizes.

Weakly-supervised pretraining (WSP) leverages images with associated 'weak' supervision for training models. In particular, we focus on internet images and use their associated text information as supervision. We convert the text into a discrete set of labels, specifically leveraging hash-tag information $[27,52,70]$. We then use a multi-label classification loss to train models. We refer to this method as WSP.

$\mathbf{M A E} \rightarrow \mathbf{W S P}$, or MAWS for short, first trains the encoder using the MAE self-supervised method using only the images. This pre-pretraining stage initializes the model while simultaneously being computationally efficient because of the masking used in MAE. In the second stage, we pretrain the encoder using both the image and associated weak supervision. This combination outperforms using either strategy in isolation, i.e., an MAE model or a weakly supervised model trained from scratch.

## 4. Experiments

We empirically evaluate and analyze large scale MAE pre-pretraining using Instagram data on a variety of different visual recognition tasks. We describe the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation, followed by analysis of the pretraining design decisions, and finally the downstream transfer evaluation of our learned representation.

### 4.1. Datasets and training details

Pretraining dataset. We use Instagram-3B (IG-3B) a billion-scale multi-label dataset sourced from Instagram (IG). This multi-label dataset contains $28 \mathrm{~K}$ classes and 3B unique images, resampled to 5B total images, and was produced by running the dataset generation pipeline from SWAG [70] without modification. Compared to [70], our version of the dataset has $16 \%$ fewer images (3.0B vs. 3.6B), but we were able to reproduce the results from [70] with our version. We obtain labels using an automated process wherein we first obtain hashtags from the associated image captions, and then map the hashtags to WordNet synsets following [70]. After this processing, we get the weakly labeled IG dataset that contains images and their associated labels.

Evaluation datasets. We evaluate MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP on a variety of different downstream visual recognition tasks. To evaluate our model on image classification, we use the standard ImageNet-1k [64] (IN1k) dataset, and also the longtailed and fine-grained iNaturalist-18 [36] (iNat18) dataset. For object detection and segmentation, we use the popular COCO [49] dataset, and also LVIS [32], a large vocabulary dataset for long tailed object recognition. We evaluate video classification performance using two popular action recognition datasets, Kinetics-400 [43] (K400) and Something Something-v2 [30] (SSv2). For zero-shot transfer, we evaluate on IN1k and Food-101 [9] (F-101). We also evaluate the robustness of our models on test sets which overlap with IN1k classes, specifically ImageNetv2 [61] (INv2), ImageNet-ReaL [7] (IN-ReaL), and ObjectNet [6]

Figure 2: Scaling MAE with model and dataset size. We plot MAE's performance when pretrained on ImageNet-1k or Instagram-3B and finetuned on downstream tasks. MAE scales to billion parameters sized models using just IN1k pretraining. Larger models show improved scaling behavior when pretrained with the much larger IG-3B dataset. Tabulated results in Appendix Table 20. IN1k and iNat18 results are finetuned at 224 px resolution. For COCO and LVIS, MAE pretrained on IN1k for ViT-2B is missing as training at that scale was unstable, and ViT-6.5B results are skipped due to compute limitations.

(ON). Please see Table 2 for more details.

MAE pretraining details. We follow [33] to train MAE models on IG-3B without using any labels. We mask $75 \%$ of the image for this training and train the model for 1 epoch over the dataset. We follow the same hyperparameters used in [33] for pretraining on IN1k.

Supervised pretraining details. We train with a supervised cross-entropy loss on IG-3B using the hashtags as labels. This model is trained by default with random weight initialization and we use the training hyperparameters from [70].

Using pre-pretraining. When using pre-pretraining, we first train a model from scratch using MAE on the IG dataset. We then use the weights of the MAE encoder and perform supervised pretraining using the cross-entropy loss as described above. We reuse the same hyperparameters and training details as [70], i.e. there is no hyperparameter search needed for MAE $\rightarrow \mathrm{WSP}$, and we train for 1 epoch on IG-3B.

Zero-shot training and evaluation details. To impart zero shot understanding capabilities to our models, we use the LiT approach from [86]. For LiT, we use the original (image, caption) pairs from the IG-3B dataset. We freeze the image encoder, and train a text encoder to encode the image captions and match the text embeddings to the associated image embedding using a CLIP loss [59]. We train the text encoder for 1 epoch. For evaluation, we follow [59] - we use the text encoder to compute embeddings from the templated text descriptions of classes and use the cosine similarity of the image and text embeddings as the classification score.

For full training details and hyperparameters, please refer to Appendix A.

### 4.2. Scaling MAE pretraining to large data

Since our pre-pretraining uses MAE in the very first stage, we first study how MAE behaves on the large scale IG-3B dataset. We compare the performance of MAE pretraining on the large scale IG-3B with the original MAE [33] models trained on IN1k for 1600 epochs. We train models of varying sizes, from ViT-B to ViT-H as in [33]. To test the scaling behavior further, we also train MAE on ViT-2B and ViT-6.5B, with 2B and 6.5B parameters, respectively. We measure the performance of the resulting models in Figure 2 on four different vision tasks.

We observe that using the IG-3B data provides consistent gains over IN1k for all vision tasks, and the gain increases for larger models. These experiments show that MAE scales with the size of the pretraining dataset, and benefits from using billions of images from IG-3B. He et al. [33]'s findings were limited to the fact that MAE scales with the size of the model, and thus our findings on MAE scaling with the size of the pretraining data are complementary to theirs.

Our ViT-2B model pretrained on IG-3B improves upon the best results from [33] on image classification, attaining $87.8 \%$ on IN1k ( $+0.9 \%$ ) and $85.6 \%$ on iNat18 ( $+2.6 \%$ ) at $224 \times 224$ resolution. The gains on detection are equally encouraging, with our ViT-2B reaching 53.6 AP ${ }^{\text {box }}$ on LVIS (+2.1 over [33]) and $59.8 \mathrm{AP}^{\text {box }}$ on COCO (+1.2 over [33]). Our ViT-6.5B model further improves the downstream performance, attaining $88.3 \%$ on IN1k and $86.6 \%$ on iNat18 at just $224 \times 224$ resolution.

Lastly, we highlight the simplicity of our setup, since we use the same hyperparameters as [33] to train MAE on

IG-3B, even for the $3 \times$ and $10 \times$ larger ViT-2B and ViT6.5B models, without requiring extra tweaks. We note that training the ViT-6.5B was sensitive to numerical stability issues, so we trained the model with full precision to avoid divergence.

### 4.3. MAE pre-pretraining

Given the promising aspects of MAE as a pretraining approach from $\S 4.2$, specifically that MAE (i) trains with larger models and datasets without needing any tuning (ii) shows gains when scaling model and / or dataset size (iii) is efficient to train, we investigate it as a pre-pretraining approach for supervised pretraining (WSP).

Figure 1 shows the performance of a ViT-L with MAE pretraining, supervised pretraining (WSP), or MAE pre-pretraining followed by supervised pretraining $(\mathrm{MAE} \rightarrow \mathrm{WSP})$. We see that MAE and WSP have different strengths. MAE has strong performance for object detection, and full finetuned image classification. However, MAE underperforms on tasks where the model is not finetuned, such as linear classifiers, zero-shot, or low-shot classification situations where WSP performs better. For these evaluations MAE lags behind WSP by more than 10 points, which is why the results for MAE are not visible in Figure 1. For video classification, MAE performs significantly better than WSP on SSv2, but lags behind it on K400.

$\mathrm{MAE} \rightarrow \mathrm{WSP}$ outperforms either of MAE or WSP pretraining on most evaluations, across image classification, video recognition, zero-shot evaluation, object detection, etc. Given that all baselines are trained at billion-scale, these results show that MAE $\rightarrow \mathrm{WSP}$ is a simple yet promising strategy to improve performance while requiring no extra data or tuning. Next, we ablate the key aspects of MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP.

After initialization, all models are pretrained using WSP on the IG-3B dataset, and we measure the transfer performance on IN1k using linear probing. We observe that MAE pre-pretraining gives consistent gains over the WSP baseline across all model sizes, ranging from $86 \mathrm{M}$ to 6.5B parameters. The gains over the WSP baseline increase for larger model sizes showing that pre-pretraining shows promising scaling behavior with model sizes. Notably, a 2B MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP model outperforms a larger 6.5B WSP model.

Number of pre-pretraining epochs. We vary the number of MAE pre-pretraining and the number of WSP pretraining epochs to understand their effect on the final recognition performance. We study this in Figure 4.

Pre-pretraining improves results over the standard pretraining (random initialization, w/o pre-pretraining), and provides large gains with fewer WSP pretraining epochs. Pre-pretraining also leads to faster convergence since even a small amount of pre-pretraining for 0.1 epochs provides improvements. Increasing the epochs of pre-pretraining provide a larger improvement, and the gains saturate at 1 epoch of pre-pretraining. Finally, pre-pretraining's gains do not diminish even after 4 epochs of WSP (20 billion samples) showing the value of pre-pretraining at scale. We also note that these gains are independent of the evaluation protocol, and we observed them with full finetuning on IN1k as well.

Training efficiency. Figure 5 shows a comparison between WSP and MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP when comparing training FLOPs. For the same training FLOPs, MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP achieves better transfer performance compared to WSP, and is up to $2 \times$ more efficient. Pre-pretraining's training efficiency holds over a large $10 \times$ compute window.
Different datasets for pre-pretraining. We also evaluate the performance of MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP when pre-pretraining MAE on the much smaller ImageNet-1k dataset below, and find that pre-pretraining remains just as effective. This allows reusing pretrained MAE models in practice.

| MAE <br> Dataset | WSP <br> Dataset | Arch. | IN1k | iNat18 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IG-3B | IG-3B | ViT-H | 89.3 | 90.5 |
| IN1k | IG-3B | ViT-H | 89.4 | 90.5 |

Different datasets for pre-pretraining and pretraining. We investigate the effect of the dataset used in pre-pretraining and pretraining by using IN21k [21] for all methods, including MAE and MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP. Compared to IG-3B, IN21k is more curated, smaller (14M images), and has cleaner labels ( $21 \mathrm{~K}$ classes), where each image is labeled with one class from the WordNet synsets [53]. For evaluating zero shot performance, we use the PMD [69] dataset for LiT training. For full details about the hyperparameters, refer to Appendix A.

Figure 6 compares the performance of MAE, WSP and MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP when pretrained on this IN21k dataset. We notice a similar trend as when pretraining on IG-3B where MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP outperforms both MAE and WSP. This shows that MAE pre-pretraining works with datasets of different scales and distributions.

### 4.4. Transfer Evaluation

We compare with state-of-the-art research on image and video classification, detection and segmentation, low-shot image classification, zero shot transfer, robustness analysis. For brevity, we refer to MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP as MAWS in this section.

Table 5: Low shot image classification. We compare the performance of our models using just a few examples per class for ImageNet-1k and iNaturalist-18. MAWS excels at classification even with just 1 example per class. Pretraining on large scale data can outperform techniques designed to work well in the low data regime, like MSN. We evaluate and report results for each technique with the best

Table 6: Zero shot image classification results. We evaluate zero-shot transfer on IN1k and Food-101. Our models push the state-of-the-art on F-101, while being competitive on IN1k. The best performing models on IN1k train on JFT$3 \mathrm{~B}$ and ALIGN, and the performance on the two datasets is not well correlated, exemplifying the impact of pretraining dataset choice on zero-shot transfer performance.

ImageNet-1k image classification. Table 3 shows the performance of different methods on IN1k. MAWS gets the best performance for a ViT-H sized model ( $89.3 \%$ ). Recent methods such as Scale-ViT [85] are better on IN1k and we hypothesize that this gap stems mainly from the differences in the pretraining datasets (IG-3B vs. JFT-3B). We also compute linear performance using frozen features on IN1k at 224px resolution. Our models produce strong features which outperform other methods with WSP objectives. They also surpass the performance of the self-supervised DINOv2 [56] model optimized to produce strong frozen representations:

| MAWS | IG-3B | ViT-2B | 88.1 |
| MAWS | IG-3B | ViT-6.5B | $\mathbf{8 8 . 6}$ |

Robustness for image classification. We evaluate the robustness of our models finetuned on IN1k on additional test sets whose classes overlap with IN1k in Table 3 to evaluate the generalization and robustness of our models to additional test sets. We find that, despite MAWS being $0.4 \%$ behind Scale-ViT on IN1k, it is significantly more robust and generalizes better on these additional test sets - MAWS gets the highest reported performance on ImageNetv2, ImageNetReaL and ObjectNet for IN1k finetuned models. We also see the benefits of scaling models even up to 6.5 B parameters on ImageNetv2 and ObjectNet, where the performance continues to improve significantly with increases in model size.
Generalization in image classification. We evaluate the generalization of our model on additional fine-grained image classification using iNaturalist-18. iNat18 is a challenging long-tailed and fine-grained dataset with images of multiple species of visually similar plants and animals. For the same size, our ViT-H outperforms the previous best result [33] by $3.7 \%$. Our ViT-6.5B sets a new state-of-the-art result on iNat18 (+4.9\% over [33])

Video classification. In Table 4 we investigate how MAWS's pretraining transfers to video action classification on K400 and SSv2. MAWS is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, including ones that pretrain on videos, whereas our models are only pretrained on images. Specifically, our ViT-L gets the highest reported performance on both video datasets. For all video finetuning, we use relative position embeddings [24], which improves our performance by $0.6 \%$ on K400 for a ViT-L. Overall, the results indicate the promise of MAE pre-pretraining for building strong video understanding models.

Low-shot image classification. We evaluate the label efficiency of our models using a few examples per class for finetuning. We use two datasets, IN1k and iNat18, with $K$ shots (labeled examples per class), $K \in\{1,5,10\}$. For iNat18, as some classes have less than $K$ images, we adapt our setting to consider at most $K$ shots. For each value of $K$, we generate 5 splits of the original dataset using 5 different random seeds and report the mean top-1 accuracy.

We evaluate two protocols for low-shot finetuning - linear classifiers and Adapters [37], both of which keep the entire model parameters frozen and introduce a few trainable parameters. We evaluated multiple Adapters proposed for ViTs - LoRA [38], AdaptFormer [14], and VPT [42]. We

Our ViT-H significantly outperforms SWAG which uses the same pretraining and model size, but without pre-pretraining. Our detection performance also improves with the larger 2B parameter model.

found that VPT performed the best while being robust to the choice of hyperparameters, and outperforms linear classifiers for our models. For other works, we report with the best protocol. Full details in Appendix B.

Table 5 shows a comparison with state-of-the-art methods on low-shot IN1k and iNat18, including foundational and self-supervised models. Our models show impressive lowshot performance on both IN1k and iNat18, reaching $84.6 \%$ and $80.9 \%$ top-1 accuracy with only 10 labeled examples per class, respectively. They reach the highest reported performance with just one labeled example per class on IN1k of $63.6 \%$.

Zero-shot transfer. Strong foundational models are expected to also have a good open world understanding of visual concepts. To equip our pretrained vision encoders with such capabilities, we utilize LiT [86]. We initialize the text encoder from an XLM-R Large [17] model. Table 6 shows the zero-shot transfer performance of our models on ImageNet-1k, and Food-101. Our ViT-2B attains $82.1 \%$ accuracy on IN1k, outperforming a similarly sized OpenCLIP model. Our results lag behind other works which pretrain on datasets such as JFT-3B and ALIGN, highlighting the importance of the pretraining dataset for performance. This data-advantage is also observed in the finetuning results discussed in Table 3, where JFT-3B provides best IN1k accuracy. On Food-101 we attain the highest zero-shot transfer accuracy of $96.2 \%$. The performance on the two datasets is not well correlated, further demonstrating the impact the pretraining dataset can have on a particular zero-shot task.

Detection and segmentation. Next, we evaluate models on detection and instance segmentation, on the LVIS [32] (Table 7) and COCO [49] datasets (Table 8). We use the Cascade Mask R-CNN framework [35], with the ViTDet [47] architecture, and initialize the backbone with our pretrained models. For finetuning our models, we start with the hyperparameters from [47] and adapt them for our models, full details are in Appendix B. We also perform a system level comparison with other state-of-the-art works, but note that drawing meaningful conclusions out of this is difficult, on ac-

count of the multiple differences in the detection frameworks, model architectures, and datasets.

On both benchmarks, MAWS considerably outperforms the weakly supervised SWAG [70] model, demonstrating the benefit of our additional pre-pretraining stage. On the long-tailed LVIS dataset, MAWS outperforms MAE IN1k pretraining on detection AP [47], but lags slightly behind on COCO. MAE's strong performance on detection using both IN1k and IG-3B (Figure 2) can potentially be explained by the fact that it is trained to reproduce images with $75 \%$ masking, whereas WSP is only trained to predict one or a few salient objects in an image. Lastly, methods which use additional detection data, such as Objects365 [67] or FLOD-9M [83], have strong detection performance.

Analyzing detection performance. We further inspect the benefits of pre-pretraining for detection in Figure 7. Unlike other tasks like image / video classification, scaling model size using WSP pretraining does not improve detection performance. However, adding MAE pre-pretraining provides consistent gains and allows WSP to scale with model size.

We dissect the performance of ViT-L models trained with MAE, WSP, and MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP in Figure 8 based on the size of the object, or by the frequency of the object's class. We observe that MAE $\rightarrow$ WSP performs better than WSP on all tasks - detecting rare to frequent classes across small to large object sizes. It improves over MAE at detecting rare objects, presumably because of the diversity in the IG-3B labels.

Performance over $\sim 100 \times$ model size spectrum. So far we have focused our evaluations on large scale models (ViTH, ViT-2B, ViT-6.5B). In Table 9 we show the performance of all our models on IN1k, evaluated using linear classifiers as well as with finetuning. We note that our approach works very well for small scale models (ViT-B, ViT-L) as

Table 9: MAE and MAWS IN1k performance across all model scales. We show the linear and finetuned performance on ImageNet$1 \mathrm{k}$ for MAE and MAWS pretraining on Instagram-3B. Both MAE pre-pretraining and MAWS scale well, starting from $86 \mathrm{M}$ parameters, up to $6.5 \mathrm{~B}$ parameters. Using frozen features and when finetuned, MAWS models are some of the strongest models on ImageNet-1k at all size scales.

## 5. Conclusion

We introduced pre-pretraining which is an initial stage in the standard pretrain-then-finetune paradigm. Prepretraining uses MAE and thus, does not need additional supervision and can be conveniently added to web-scale training pipelines. We show that pre-pretraining improves downstream performance on multiple different recognition tasks, improves model convergence, and is overall more efficient than standard weakly-supervised pretraining. Our self-supervised pre-pretraining improves results for models trained with billions of labels, showing that it is a scalable technique that matters even at web-scale. The benefits of using pre-pretraining hold across varying model sizes, and different pretraining data distributions showing that it is a robust technique. Finally, pre-pretraining naturally and successfully combines the two most common pretraining strategies - self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning. Our results suggest that model initialization plays a significant role in the final performance, training dynamics etc. even for web-scale training with billions of parameter updates and labels, and should be further investigated.
