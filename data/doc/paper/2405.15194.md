#### Abstract

Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is pronounced if there are stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function specific to each problem is challenging, even for domain experts. They would either have to rely on task-specific domain knowledge or provide an expert demonstration independently for each task. Given, that Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly gained prominence across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: Can we leverage LLMs to construct a reward shaping function that can boost the sample efficiency of an RL agent? In this work, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a guide policy by solving a simpler deterministic abstraction of the original problem that can then be used to construct the reward shaping function for the downstream RL agent. Given the ineffectiveness of directly prompting LLMs, we propose MEDIC: a framework that augments LLMs with a Model-based feEDback critIC, which verifies LLM-generated outputs, to generate a possibly sub-optimal but valid plan for the abstract problem. Our experiments across domains from the BabyAI environment suite show 1) the effectiveness of augmenting LLMs with MEDIC, 2) a significant improvement in the sample complexity of PPO and A2C-based RL agents when guided by our LLM-generated plan, and finally, 3) pave the direction for further explorations of how these models can be used to augment existing RL pipelines.


## 1 Introduction

Sample inefficiency of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in sparse reward domains ${ }^{1}$ has been a long-standing challenge Ng et al. [1999], Laud and DeJong [2003], Marthi [2007], Grzes and Kudenko [2008], Devlin and Kudenko [2011]. The number of environment interactions further increase if the domain further consists of stochastic transitions Grzes [2017], Ben-Porat et al. [2024]. In an effort to improve this sample complexity, reward shaping has been proven to be effective, which provides intrinsic rewards as a better training signal over just the sparse extrinsic (environment)[^0]rewards Laud and DeJong [2003], Marthi [2007], Devlin and Kudenko [2011]. In particular, Potentialbased Reward Shaping (PBRS) has been a popular approach that provides a reward shaping function as a difference in potential values, along with the policy invariance guarantee $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al. [1999].

Underlying all reward shaping techniques including PBRS and its variants Devlin et al. [2011], Devlin and Kudenko [2012], Gao and Toni [2015], Eck et al. [2016], there is an inherent assumption made on how this reward shaping function can be constructed. One of the straightforward ways is for a domain expert to hand-engineer the reward shaping function, which can be cognitively demanding and additionally lead to a cognitive bias in the engineered rewards Wu et al. [2024], Lightman et al. [2023]. Yet another popular approach relies on learning the intrinsic rewards via Inverse RL (IRL) Russell [1998], Abbeel and Ng [2004], Russell and Norvig [2016], where the human records an expert demonstration for solving the task. While existing research tackles the problems associated with each of these approaches to some extent, an important issue that has been overlooked is the effort required to design or learn a task-specific reward shaping function. In doing so, the domain expert would either have to rely on domain knowledge pertaining to the specific task at hand, or determine a solution for reaching the goal in each task and provide an expert demonstration for the same.

Lately, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance spanning a wide variety of natural language-based tasks Kocoń et al. [2023], Gilardi et al. [2023], Zhu et al. [2023] which can be attributed to the enormous and diverse data that they have been trained on. While some tasks have benefited from prompting off-the-shelf LLMs Bubeck et al. [2023], Bhattacharjee et al. [2024], others that are either highly domain-specific or require higher degrees of generalizability, require fine-tuning Li et al. [2024], Yang et al. [2024]. However, several recent studies have shown the performance of prompting LLMs directly to be brittle and unreliable Valmeekam et al. [2023], Stechly et al. [2024], Verma et al. [2024]. Similarly, the latter approach is bottlenecked by the need for sufficient task-specific data and expensive computation required for LLM fine-tuning. Yet, they continue to show some promise when tasked with solving a sufficiently relaxed version of the original problem Nirmal et al. [2024], or assisting in obtaining the final solution Kambhampati et al. [2024]. Keeping this trade-off in mind for our use case, we aim to answer the following question through this work: Can we leverage LLMs to construct a reward shaping function that can boost the sample efficiency of an RL agent?

From the limited exploratory works that currently lie at utilizing LLMs for guiding RL Liang et al. [2023], Du et al. [2023], Carta et al. [2023], Jiang et al. [2019], Kwon et al. [2023], Wang et al. [2023], Ma et al. [2023], LLMs have particularly been effective in providing either high-level (symbolic) policy guidance (Jiang et al. [2019], Liang et al. |2023]) or the reward function (Kwon et al. [2023], Ma et al. [2023]), which may only be feasible for tasks where there has been sufficient background knowledge or data that could have possibly been part of the language model's training. Other approaches have fine-tuned LLMs to learn the policy for text-based environments directly Carta et al. [2023], which carry all the limitations of fine-tuning that we listed above.

To this end, we take inspiration from the problem abstraction methods, which have been extensively studied in the planning and RL literature Dietterich et al. [1998], Sutton et al. [1999], Lane and Kaelbling [2002], Kattenbelt et al. [2010], Kulkarni et al. [2016], Gopalan et al. [2017], Jiang et al. [2019], Nashed et al. [2021], and query LLMs to obtain a solution for this sufficiently relaxed problem (in our case, we construct a deterministic abstraction of the original stochastic Markov Decision Process (MDP)). Furthermore, we propose MEDIC, a framework that consists of a Model-based feEDback critIC which, at every step of the environment interaction, verifies the LLM-generated output and can generate a possibly sub-optimal but valid plan with soundness guarantees where possible Kambhampati et al. [2024]. By Model-based, we specifically refer to constructing a module based on the environment and task knowledge, which can back-prompt the LLM when it generates an invalid output. Specifically, in our case, an invalid action at any given environment state can be viewed as an invalid LLM output; and by back-prompt, we refer to the feedback that can be given to LLMs to improve the correctness of their outputs on the desired task. Note that while the idea of such critiques or verifiers has been recently seen in other contexts, primarily for checking the syntactic correctness of LLM-generated code Liang et al. [2023], Ma et al. [2023], Wang et al. [2023], we take one step further from syntactic verification and aim to construct and utilize Model-based critiques for improving LLM-generated responses. Finally, we leverage the LLM-generated plan as a basis for constructing the reward shaping function for the downstream RL sparse reward task.

The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1. We propose MEDIC, a framework to augment an off-the-shelf LLM with a model-based feedback critic that can generate a valid plan for a relaxed search problem.
2. Utilizing this LLM-generated plan, we construct a reward shaping function for the downstream stochastic sparse-reward problem.
3. With experiments on the BabyAI suite of environments, we show the utility of our approach for boosting the sample complexity of RL algorithms by demonstrating results with PPO and A2C algorithms.

For the rest of the paper, we begin with situating our work in the domain of LLM-guided RL works and give a brief background of the respective literature Section 2 Next, we formally define our problem statement and discuss the proposed framework and its utilization for reward shaping in detail in Section 3, followed by a thorough empirical analysis in Section 4, Finally, we discuss the limitations of our framework in Section 5 , and conclude the work by discussing the possible applications and extensions of this work in Section 6. Appendix has also been attached which includes a detailed description of all our experiments, hyperparameters, additional ablations, results, anonymized code and a short note on the broader impact of this work.

## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Sparse Reward RL and LLM-based Guidance

The seminal foundational work by $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al. [1999] provided policy invariance guarantees using Potential-based Reward Shaping (PBRS) for boosting the sample efficiency of RL agents, followed by further theoretical investigations by Laud and DeJong [2003], Wiewiora [2003]. Pathak et al. [2017] also showed the advantages of using intrinsic rewards for training RL agents. Reward shaping methods have been studied under several dimensions, including but not limited to automatic reward learning Grzes and Kudenko [2008], Marthi [2007], multi-agent domains Devlin and Kudenko [2011], Sun et al. [2018], meta-learning Zou et al.|[2019], etc. Primarily, the sources of obtaining and/or learning intrinsic rewards includes domain experts hand-engineering the rewards Wu et al. [2024], Lightman et al. [2023], via providing feedback Lee et al. [2023], or via providing expert demonstrations Argall et al. [2009]. More recently, Large Language Models have been utilized to give feedback on RL agent's environment interaction Du et al. [2023], Ma et al. [2023], Kwon et al. [2023], Cao et al. [2024] or directly provide the reward function for the RL agent's task. Note, that directly querying LLMs for feedback or reward functions requires prompt engineering efforts, with the reliance on the domain experts to be able to inject cognitive bias such that LLMs are able to respond with the expert's intended results.

### 2.2 LLMs for Planning and Search

There is a research divide in the current literature regarding the planning, reasoning and verification abilities of Large Language Models. While popular works claiming LLM reasoning abilities have proposed several prompting methods Wei et al. [2022], Yao et al. [2023], Long [2023], Yao et al. [2024], Besta et al. [2024], there have been independent investigations refuting such claims using LLMs for solving deterministic planning and classical reasoning problems Valmeekam et al. [2023], Stechly et al. [2024], Verma et al. [2024]. While LLMs are themselves not reliable for providing accurate feedback Stechly et al. [2024], other than in natural language tasks Yao et al. [2023], recent works have augmented LLMs with task-specific verifiers (for example, a Python compiler that can check LLM-generated code for syntactic correctness) that can evaluate the validity (not necessarily correctness) of the LLM-generated output and provide feedback to the LLM accordingly Kambhampati et al. [2024], Ma et al. [2023], Wang et al. [2023], Liang et al. [2023]. These augmented LLM frameworks have been shown to be useful for improving the overall task performance when prompting LLMs. Our work is the first to showcase how such model-based verifiers can be constructed that can guide LLMs to solve relaxed deterministic problems. We further utilize these LLM-generated plans to construct the reward shaping function for the downstream RL agent.

(II) We construct the reward shaping function using the guide plan to add intrinsic rewards by updating the RL agent's replay buffer. (III) The RL agent learns an optimal policy with the help of these intrinsic rewards on the original stochastic sparse-reward problem.

## 3 Augmenting LLMs with MEDIC

In this section, we introduce MEDIC, our framework where an LLM augmented with a model-based feedback critic is used to generate a valid solution for a relaxed deterministic search problem. This plan is further used to construct a reward shaping function, resulting in a sample efficiency boost for the RL agent that learns a policy on the original stochastic, sparse reward problem. We first formalize our problem statement in Section 3.1 Next, we detail how we use an LLM augmented with MEDIC to interact with the BabyAI environment in Section 3.2. Finally, we present details on the reward shaping step that aids RL training, along with the training algorithm in Section 3.3

### 3.1 Problem Statement

We consider a finite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) $\mathcal{M}$ defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{R}, \gamma$ ). Here, $\mathcal{S}$ represents the set of all possible states, $\mathcal{A}$ represents the set of all possible actions, $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ is the stochastic state transition function where $\mathcal{P}\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right)$ is the transition probability for $s, s^{\prime} \in \mathcal{S}$ and $a \in \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the reward function, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. In our case, we consider an MDP $\mathcal{M}$ with sparse rewards, i.e., $\mathcal{R}=1$ for $g \in \mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{R}=0$ otherwise, where $g$ is the goal or termination state. The goal of the agent is to learn a parameterized policy $\pi_{\theta}(a \mid s)$ which maximizes the discounted cumulative reward for the trajectory $\tau, \mathcal{J}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^{t} r_{t}\right]$. For the LLM to interact with the environment, we consider the modified MDP $\mathcal{M}^{\prime}$ which is a deterministic abstraction of the original MDP $\mathcal{M}$. Hence, $\mathcal{M}^{\prime}$ can be defined using the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$, where $\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ is the deterministic transition function. We aim to obtain a guide policy $\pi_{g}$ in $\mathcal{M}^{\prime}$ using this LLM-environment interaction, that can further be used for the original downstream RL problem to learn $\pi_{\theta}$.

### 3.2 Generating Guide Policy using LLM + MEDIC

### 3.2.1 Model-based Feedback Critic Construction

We will use the BabyAI DoorKey environment, as shown in Figure 1, as the example to discuss the details of how we construct the critique. Note, that this discussion also applies to any other environment that shares the same assumptions that we make with respect to domain knowledge. It is important to note that we eventually require a set of actions from this critique, that are feasible at any given state of the environment that the agent can be in. We will refer to this set of valid actions as $\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v} \mid s\right\}$ and set of invalid actions as $\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v^{-}} \mid s\right\}$ for $s \in \mathcal{S}$. Hence, for the BabyAI DoorKey environment, we begin with computing the agent's position $(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})$ at the given state $\left(s_{i}\right.$ ). Since we assume access to domain knowledge, particularly, the environment layout and the action space, we can verify each action that the agent can and can not take for a given state, i.e., either $a \in\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v} \mid s_{i}\right\}$ or $a \in\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v^{-}} \mid s_{i}\right\}$. For example, in the state $\left(s_{i}\right)$ shown in Figure 1, the agent has already picked up the key but can only move forward if the door is open. Hence, our Model-based critique, given the agent's current position ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) and the set of valid actions $\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v}\right\}$ taken until step $i$, computes the set of actions that are feasible in the current state, i.e., turn left, turn right, and toggle (open
door). Next, given the LLM's guessed action, i.e., move forward, the critique finds the action to be infeasible and generates a back-prompt that is appended to the LLM's original prompt. We discuss further details on the prompt construction and design in the following paragraph.

### 3.2.2 Prompt Construction

At any given step $i$ in the LLM's interaction with the environment, we construct the LLM prompt with three components. The first is the Task Description that defines the task that the LLM has to achieve. For example, as shown in Figure 1 for the BabyAI DoorKey environment, we specify that the environment is a $3 \times 3$ maze that consists of objects such as a key, a door, walls, and a goal location. We further include the goal of the agent that is obtained from the environment (referred to as the mission space in the environment specification), i.e., "use the key to open the door and then get to the goal". Finally, we include the list of all actions from the environment's action space $(\mathcal{A})$.

While the Task Description is the same for the entire episode of the LLM's environment interaction, we construct the Observation Description independently at every step. This component describes the current view of the environment as shown in Figure 1. We admit that representing spatial relationships in text as an input to an LLM can be a challenging task. Inspired by the current works that have attempted to prompt LLMs with spatial descriptions Patel and Pavlick [2021], for the scope of this work, we represent the $3 \times 3$ grid as three rows of objects that are currently observed in the environment state $\left(s_{i}\right)$. Naturally, there can exist prompt engineering techniques to better represent such spatial relationships, and can be a useful direction for future investigations. Finally, the third and last component of this prompt is the Query Description, which poses the question to the LLM to guess the next action that it should take in the environment. We refer to this as the step-prompt for our discussion. Once the LLM returns a valid action as a guess to the step-prompt, i.e. $\pi_{L L M}\left(s_{i}\right)=a$ for $a \in\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v} \mid s_{i}\right\}$, we execute the action in the environment and continue the interaction.

Consider the case where the LLM has guessed an invalid action, i.e.

```
Algorithm 1 Training an offline RL policy $\pi_{\theta}$ using $\pi_{L L M}$
Require: Input $\pi_{\text {LLM }}$
Ensure: Output $\pi_{\theta}$
    Initialize parameters $\theta$, dataset $\mathcal{D}$
    $/ /$ EXPLORATION PHASE
    for each iteration do
        Store transitions $\mathcal{D} \leftarrow\left(s, a, s^{\prime}, r\right) \sim \pi_{\theta}$
        Relabel dataset with shaped rewards $\mathcal{D}^{\prime} \leftarrow \mathcal{D}, \pi_{L L M}$
    end for
    // REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PHASE
    for each gradient step do
        Sample transitions $\left\{\tau_{j}\right\}_{j=1}^{\mathcal{D}^{\prime}} \sim \mathcal{D}^{\prime}$
        train $\pi_{\theta}$ using $\left\{\tau_{j}\right\}$
    end for
    return $\pi_{\theta}$
```

In this case, we do not execute the action in the environment but rather construct the back-prompt by appending the feedback given by our Modelbased critique to the current prompt. To the existing step-prompt, we add this critique feedback that lists all the invalid actions $\left(\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v^{-}} \mid s_{i}\right\}\right)$ guessed by the LLM for the current state $s_{i}$ and prompts the LLM again to choose a different action that is not in $\left\{\mathcal{A}_{v^{-}} \mid s_{i}\right\}$. Once the LLM guesses a valid action, we break out of this back-prompting loop and continue our environment interaction. We provide an example of the complete prompt in the Appendix Section D.

### 3.3 Potential-based Reward Shaping using LLM policy

Potential-based Reward Shaping (PBRS) Ng et al. [1999] allows for injecting intrinsic rewards for training an RL agent on a sparse reward problem while guaranteeing the so-called policy invariance property. Formally, we adopt the definition which utilizes a shaping reward function $\mathcal{F}$ such that our updated reward function is $\mathcal{R}^{\prime}=\mathcal{R}+\mathcal{F}$, where for any state $s$ and action $a$, the updated reward can be defined as: $\mathcal{R}^{\prime}(s, a)=\mathcal{R}(s, a)+\mathcal{F}(s, a)$

Once we have obtained $\pi_{L L M}$ using our Model-based critique-augmented LLM framework as explained in Section 3.2, we store this goal-reaching trajectory $\tau_{g} \sim \pi_{L L M}$ and utilize it to construct our reward shaping function $\mathcal{F}$. Until we reach the goal state $s_{g}$, we sample $a \sim \pi_{L L M}(s)$ and assign uniformly increasing rewards to each $(s, a)$ pair. In the exploration phase, our offline RL agent will be storing the environment interactions, i.e., $\left(s, a, s^{\prime}, r\right)$ tuples, in a dataset buffer $\mathcal{D}$.

Given $\mathcal{F}$ constructed using $\tau_{g} \sim \pi_{L L M}$, we update the buffer $\mathcal{D}$ with the shaped rewards such that $\left(s, a, s^{\prime}, r\right) \rightarrow\left(s, a, s^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)$ where $r^{\prime}$ is the shaped reward. Our RL agent then continues the learning over this updated dataset buffer $\mathcal{D}^{\prime}$. We present the complete pipeline and the simplified algorithm in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1 , respectively.

## 4 Experiments \& Results

Recall that we first aim to investigate the advantages of augmenting off-the-shelf LLMs with MEDIC in solving relaxed deterministic search problems. Next, given the reward shaping function constructed using this LLM-generated plan, we want to measure the boost in sample efficiency for training the RL agents on the original stochastic sparse-reward problem. To do so, we utilize the BabyAI suite of environments, namely - DoorKey which is a complex environment that requires an understanding of the sub-goals (using key to open door and reaching the goal) that need to be achieved; Empty-Random where there are no obstacles but the initial position of the agent is randomized for each episode; and finally, LavaGap in which the agent has to reach the goal location while avoiding the adversarial objects (the lava tile) present in the environment (see Appendix Section Bfor more details). Through our empirical results, we aim to answer the following questions:

RQ1: How does our MEDIC framework perform in terms of plan length and total rewards?

RQ2: How effective is the reward shaping with the use of LLM-generated plans for boosting the RL sample efficiency?

### 4.1 Testing our Model-based critique-augmented LLM framework (RQ1)

In order to study RQ1, we run all our experiments using the OpenAI API for gpt-3.5-turbo. We highlight the experimental setup, baselines and evaluation metrics in the following paragraphs.

### 4.1.1 Experimental Setup

To test the robustness of our evaluations for RQ1, we run all our LLM-based experiments on three different layouts for the DoorKey-5x5 environment (varying the object and goal placements), three different layouts for the Empty-Random-5x5 environment (varying the agent's initial state independent of any environment objects being present), and one layout each of LavaGap-5x5 and DoorKey-6x6 environments (testing our framework's performance by varying environment adversariality and scalability). For each environment layout, we query our framework by bounding the maximum number of steps it can take to reach the goal to 30 , and the maximum number of back-prompts allowed at any step to 10 . Since temperature 0 does not guarantee complete determinism in LLM generation, we query each LLM three times across every environment layout. We include the ablations on the plan length and back-prompt attempts in Section 4.3 , and provide other experimental details including prompts for these experiments in the Appendix Sections C and D. We leave the discussion for critically testing the generalization of our approach across other LLM models for future investigations.

### 4.1.2 Baselines \& Evaluation Metrics

One may argue that while it may be computationally expensive given the same sparse reward problem in the deterministic setting, we can always train an offline RL agent to generate our guide plan. Note that this is only valid where we can assume that the cost of interaction with the environment is nearly negligible. As an ablation and for comparative purposes, we also evaluate directly prompting LLMs without augmenting MEDIC. Also, for the current scope of this work, since we are interested in deterministic search problems, it is easy to compute the optimal plans, for example, by using $\mathrm{A}^{*}$ search. Hence, to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of our framework, we compute the optimal plans as an upper bound, and compare our augmented LLM-generated plans in terms of 1) task success rate, 2) average length of a successful plan, and 3) average total rewards. Note, that while we only show results for deterministic search problems as a proof of concept in this work, it is worth investigating the applicability of our approach in domains where computing the optimal plan can be very costly Bhambri et al. [2022], or infeasible Silver et al. [2018].

Table 1: RQ1 Results: We train the Offline $R L$ agents for $1 \mathrm{e} 5$ steps, across 3 seeds and average the metrics by evaluating each agent over 100 episodes. For Direct LLM prompting and LLM+MEDIC (Ours) results, we prompt gpt-3.5-turbo three times with temperature $=0$ for each environment, and show the average across each metric.

| Environment | Performance <br> Metric | Offline RL | Direct LLM <br> prompting | LLM + MEDIC <br> Ours | Optimal <br> Search |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DoorKey | Avg Task Success Rate | $100 \%$ | $0 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
|  | Avg Success Plan Length | $18.43 \pm 0.601$ | - | $15.2 \pm 6.57$ | 11 |
|  | Avg Success Rewards | $0.83 \pm 0.005$ | - | $0.945 \pm 0.02$ | 0.90 |
| Empty-Random | Avg Task Success Rate | $100 \%$ | $0 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
|  | Avg Success Plan Length | $5.47 \pm 0.079$ | - | $27 \pm 1$ | 4 |
|  | Avg Success Rewards | $0.95 \pm 0.0$ | - | $0.757 \pm 0.009$ | 0.96 |
| LavaGap | Avg Task Success Rate | $100 \%$ | $0 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
|  | Avg Success Plan Length | $9.45 \pm 0.354$ | - | $16 \pm 8$ | 6 |
|  | Avg Success Rewards | $0.91 \pm 0.005$ | - | $0.8559 \pm 0.07$ | 0.95 |

### 4.1.3 Results

From the results in Table 1 , we note that while both Offline RL and our MEDIC-augmented LLM framework get $100 \%$ success rate, direct LLM prompting can not generate a valid plan in all the cases across the three environment settings. Also, the number of environment interactions required for our approach is a maximum of 30 step-prompts and 10 back-prompts for each step, compared to $1 \mathrm{e} 5$ steps required for training the RL agents. Moreover, our approach performs the closest to the optimal search results in terms of average success plan length and average success rewards. Once again, we emphasize that these results hold promise for further exploring the applications of using the critic-augmented LLM framework where obtaining search heuristics and optimal plans can be costly or computationally infeasible, respectively.

### 4.2 Evaluating the sample efficiency boost in RL training (RQ2)

To study RQ2, we train PPO and A2C algorithms on each environment layout that we mentioned in Section 4.1.1. We provide all training and hyperparameters details in the Appendix Section C

### 4.2.1 Experimental Setup

Recall, from Section 4.1, that we generate three guide plans for each environment layout. We train the PPO and A2C agents on our original stochastic sparse-reward problem, with the reward shaping function $\mathcal{F}(s, a)$ constructed using each of these guide plans. Due to space constraints, we show the results for one layout for each environment. For each experiment setting, we compare and plot our training results in terms of the total environment returns in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Results on other environment layouts and plots on the number of steps to reach the goal are shown in Appendix C

### 4.2.2 Baselines \& Evaluation Metrics

We adopt the RL baselines for both PPO and A2C algorithms from Chevalier-Boisvert et al. [2018]. Along with the base RL setting (labeled as vanilla in Figure 2 and Figure 3), we also consider an extended vanilla-text setting which also encodes the mission space (for example, for DoorKey environment, the mission space is defined as: "use the key to open the door and then get to the goal") as an input feature along with the environment state, and has been shown to be an improvement over the base RL for certain environment settings.

### 4.2.3 Results

From results shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, we note the most significant boost in sample efficiency due to the reward shaping using our augmented LLM-generated plan in the BabyAI DoorKey-5x5 environment, followed by LavaGap, and results in Empty-Random-5x5 environment are similar to the vanilla RL and vanilla RL w/ text baselines. We believe that the commonsensical domain knowledge available in the DoorKey-5x5 environment (i.e., an agent first needs to pick the key, open the door, and then reach the goal location) is possibly exploited and utilized by the LLM to successfully solve

the deterministic abstraction of the problem. Constructing the reward shaping function with this knowledge further helps the RL agent learn the optimal policy faster. For the LavaGap environment, the difference between reward-shaped policy training and the baselines is relatively smaller than that in DoorKey-5x5. One possible reason here could be that while the action space for this environment is smaller (three actions only), using the LLM-generated plan for reward shaping allows the RL agent to learn to avoid the lava tiles faster and reach the goal location. It is further useful to see that reward shaping using our approach performs at par with the baselines for the Empty-Random-5x5 environment, despite the complexity of varying agent initializations. Along with results on other layouts for DoorKey-5x5 and Empty-Random-5x5, we further show the results for the number of steps to reach the goal in the Appendix Section $\mathrm{C}$.

### 4.3 Ablations and Additional Experiments

In relation to the experiments for RQ1 (Section 4.1) and RQ2 (Section 4.2), we perform the following additional experiments and briefly discuss our findings for each:

Number of step-prompts (RQ1): By varying the number of allowed step-prompts across 10, 20, 30, $\& 50$ for two environment layouts of the DoorkKey-5x5 environment and five trials, we find that our framework is successfully able to find a valid plan solving the task each time when given 30 and 50 step-prompts along with 10 back-prompts. We observe $\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ failures for 10 and 20 step-prompt experiments, respectively. This indicates, that given enough trials which may be dependent on the complexity and scale of the gridworld, our framework is successfully able to find a valid plan.

Number of back-prompts (RQ1): By varying the number of allowed back-prompts across 3, 5, \& 10 for two environment layouts of the DoorkKey-5x5 environment and five trials, we find that our framework is successfully able to find a valid plan solving the task each time when given 10 back-prompts, along with 30 step-prompts. We observe $\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ failures for 3 and 5 back-prompt experiments, respectively. This indicates, that given enough trials which may be dependent on the complexity and size of the action space of the gridworld, our framework is successfully able to find a valid plan.

Environment Scalability (RQ1): By running our experiments on a larger gridworld, i.e., DoorKey$6 x 6$, we are able to achieve the reward shaping plan using our approach by querying the LLM with 100 step-prompts limit and 20 back-prompts limit. Furthermore, from Figures 2 and 3 , we observe a sample efficiency boost close to $29 \%$ and $52 \%$ over PPO and A2C baselines, respectively.

Reward Shaping without MEDIC (RQ2): We also construct a reward shaping function by using the partially correct plan generated by directly prompting the LLM. For one layout of DoorKey-5x5 environment, we get a plan with only one action correct and assign a +0.1 reward for that (state, action) pair. Expectedly, we observe no improvement in sample efficiency of the vanilla RL setting, thereby, reaffirming the importance of reward shaping using only a correct plan that can be obtained with our MEDIC-augmented LLM framework. Note that future work can relax this assumption by better utilizing the partially correct LLM-generated plan for constructing the reward shaping function. We show the plots for this ablation in the Appendix Section C

## 5 Limitations

While augmenting off-the-shelf LLMs with our MEDIC framework leads to a sample efficiency boost for downstream RL training, we would like to highlight some of the limitations associated with our approach. Firstly, the abstraction chosen for the original problem can be a bottleneck to our framework's approach. Based on the chosen problem abstraction, the model-based feedback critic needs to be updated accordingly such that it can provide useful feedback to the LLM. Secondly, there is an engineering effort required to determine the correct textual representations of the environment/task. Prompt designs may need to be updated for other environment domains. Finally, while none of our plots for RQ2 showed any negative impacts of the shaped rewards constructed using our framework, there may be a possibility where constructing a reward shaping using a sub-optimal plan can harm the RL training, thereby leading to a drop in performance with respect to episodic returns. This highlights an important future direction of extracting only the useful (state, action) transitions from such a plan to generate the intrinsic rewards, which is currently out of the scope of this work.

## 6 Conclusion \& Future Work

Task-specific reward shaping to construct intrinsic rewards useful for training Reinforcement Learning agents requires expert domain knowledge and engineering efforts. Obtaining reward shaping functions from domain experts can also lead to the injection of cognitive bias, which can influence the downstream RL training. Lately, Large Language Models have shown remarkable success in a variety of natural language tasks, while also encountering limitations when it comes to prompting them for planning and reasoning domains. Keeping these limitations in mind, we leveraged LLMs in this work to guide RL training in sparse reward tasks across a variety of environments from the BabyAI suite. Instead of relying on prompting off-the-shelf LLMs or fine-tuning them, we proposed an approach to build Model-based critiques that can be augmented with LLMs to verify their guessed outputs and provide feedback in an automated fashion. Using these generated plans on the deterministic abstraction of the original problem, we constructed a Potential-based Reward Shaping function. We noticed a boost in the sample efficiency of downstream RL training on the original sparse reward stochastic problem using PPO and A2C algorithms. From these results, we believe that our work can
pave the direction for further exploring the meaningful advantages Large Language Models can offer to Reinforcement Learning.
