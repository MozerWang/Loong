#### Abstract

Despite efforts to align large language models to produce harmless responses, they are still vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit unrestricted behaviour. In this work, we investigate persona modulation as a black-box jailbreaking method to steer a target model to take on personalities that are willing to comply with harmful instructions. Rather than manually crafting prompts for each persona, we automate the generation of jailbreaks using a language model assistant. We demonstrate a range of harmful completions made possible by persona modulation, including detailed instructions for synthesising methamphetamine, building a bomb, and laundering money. These automated attacks achieve a harmful completion rate of $42.5 \%$ in GPT-4, which is 185 times larger than before modulation ( $0.23 \%)$. These prompts also transfer to Claude 2 and Vicuna with harmful completion rates of $61.0 \%$ and $35.9 \%$, respectively. Our work reveals yet another vulnerability in commercial large language models and highlights the need for more comprehensive safeguards.


## 1 Introduction

The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) raises the need for safety measures that prevent misuse. However, these safeguards have numerous limitations (Casper et al. 2023a), and researchers continuously find ways around them: jailbreaks Wei et al. (2023). Jailbreaks are adversarially designed prompts that circumvent safeguards to elicit unrestricted behaviours from language models. Despite significant efforts to defend against them, the complex nature of text inputs and the blurred boundary between data and executable instructions (Greshake et al. (2023) have allowed adversaries to surpass these safeguards.

This work explores persona-modulation attacks, a general jailbreaking method for state-of-theart aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2. Persona-modulation attacks steer the model into adopting a specific personality that is likely to comply with harmful instructions. For[^0]example, to circumvent safety measures that prevent misinformation, we steer the model into behaving like an "Aggressive propagandist". Unlike recent work on adversarial jailbreaks (Zou et al. 2023, Carlini et al., 2023) that are limited to a single prompt-answer pair, persona modulation enables the attacker to enter an unrestricted chat mode that can be used to collaborate with the model on complex tasks that require several steps such as synthesising drugs, building bombs, or laundering money.

Manual persona modulation requires significant effort to produce effective prompts. Therefore, we present automated persona-modulation attacks, a technique that uses an LLM assistant to speed up the creation of jailbreaking prompts. In this setup, the manual effort is reduced to designing a single jailbreak prompt to get GPT-4 to behave as a research assistant. GPT-4 can then create specialised persona-modulation prompts for arbitrary tasks and personas.

We find that automated persona-modulation attacks are viable and scalable. Automated persona modulation can extract completions from GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c) for many harmful topics, where the model would otherwise abstain. Examples of these topics include supporting child labour, helping with illegal activities, or promoting homophobia and sexism. Moreover, our jailbreak prompts directly transfer to Claude 2 (Anthropic, 2023) and Vicuna (Zheng et al. 2023b) with similar performance. Automated persona modulation significantly increases the rate of responses classified as harmful for Vicuna $(0.23 \% \rightarrow 35.92 \%)$, GPT-4 $(0.23 \% \rightarrow 42.48 \%)$, and Claude $2(1.40 \% \rightarrow 61.03 \%)$.

Although automated persona-modulation attacks are fast, they can be less successful at producing harmful completions than manual persona-modulation attacks. To combine the advantages of both approaches, we introduce semi-automated persona modulation attacks. This approach introduces a human-in-the-loop who can modify the outputs of each stage of the automated workflow to maximise the harmfulness of the LLM output. This semi-automated approach recovers the performance of a manual persona-modulation attack, with up to a $25 \mathrm{x}$ reduction in time. Overall, we make two contributions.

1. Methodological: We introduce an automated, black-box method for generating customised personamodulation attacks against large language models. We also demonstrate how a human-in-the-loop can enable stronger exploits with much less effort than manual attacks.
2. Empirical: We find that state-of-the-art aligned language models, including GPT-4 and Claude 2, are vulnerable to these attacks, which can elicit many capabilities currently restricted by providers

## 2 Related Work

Safety and alignment strategies for LLMs. Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c), Claude 2 (Anthropic, 2023), and Vicuna (Chiang et al. 2023) are trained to prevent misuse and protect users from harmful content. The most prominent safety techniques are reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and adversarial training on known vulnerabilities. RLHF uses human preferences (Ouyang et al. 2022, Christiano et al., 2017) to finetune models for helpfulness and safety (Bai et al., 2022). However, there are several foundational and technical limitations to RLHF finetuning (Casper et al. 2023a), which make it difficult to develop robustly-aligned AI systems using it.

Attacking and jailbreaking LLMs. Despite considerable efforts to ensure safety, researchers have systematically found adversarial prompts that result in undesirable completions: jailbreaks. These jailbreaks can be handcrafted without access to model weights (Wei et al., 2023, Liu et al. 2023b a), or optimized if white-box access to the model is available (Carlini et al. 2023 Jones et al. 2023 Shin et al. 2020). Moreover, Zou et al. (2023) show that white-box access might not be required since prompts optimized on open-source models can transfer to larger private models. LLMs can also be used to find adversarial prompts for other target models (Deng et al. 2022, Perez et al. 2022; Casper et al., 2023b; Chao et al. 2023).

Steering LLMs with personas. Our jailbreaks exploit persona modulation Park et al. 2023 Deshpande et al. 2023; Shanahan et al. 2023 Joshi et al. 2023). This technique instructs an LLM to behave according to a very specific personality: a persona. For instance, Deshpande et al. (2023) use persona modulation to
generate toxic completions by eliciting personas aligned with famous people. The success of their technique, however, hinges on the toxicity of the characteristics of these people in the LLM's training corpus. Wolf et al. (2023) argue that persona modulation may be a persistent problem due to fundamental limitations of alignment with LLMs.

Relation to prior work. In the context of established research, our approach exploits modulation with arbitrary personas to elicit targeted behaviours currently restricted by language model providers. Our jailbreaking method is black-box and can be used against LLMs deployed with state-of-the-art safeguards as of the publishing of this paper. We also study persona-modulation attacks on 43 harmful categories, a significantly wider range than previous work.

## 3 Automated Persona-Modulation Attacks

We assume an attacker who has black-box access to the target model. Our approach to persona modulation is illustrated in Fig. 1 and consists of 4 consecutive steps:

1. Definition of a target harmful category (e.g. "promoting disinformation campaigns").
2. Definition of specific misuse instructions for which the model would abstain by default (e.g., "How might someone spread their perspective widely?").
3. Definition of a persona that would likely comply with the misuse instructions. For our running example, a useful persona could be "Aggressive Propagandist: advocates for misinformation to influence public opinion". The success of the attack strongly depends on the chosen persona.
4. Design of a persona-modulation prompt to steer the model to assume the proposed persona. Since state-of-the-art models generally decline to assume a persona due to the safety measures in place, this last step requires prompt engineering and is time-consuming to perform manually.

Manual persona modulation-executing all 4 steps manually-requires significant manual effort from the attacker to find suitable personas and design persona-modulation prompts for specific misuse instructions. We introduce automated persona-modulation attacks to generate jailbreaks at scale with the help of an LLM assistant (which may or may not be the same as the target model). Instead of writing a persona-modulation prompt for each misuse instruction, the attacker only needs a single prompt that instructs the assistant to generate jailbreaking tasks. We use the assistant model to find personas and write persona-modulation prompts for a variety of misuse instructions. This way, the attacker can automate steps 2-4 in Figure 1.

## 4 Empirical Evaluation

### 4.1 Experimental setup

In our experiments, we use GPT-4 as both the primary target of our attacks and as the assistant model for generating them 1 . We also evaluate the attacks' transferability to Anthropic's Claude 2 Anthropic, 2023) and Vicuna-33B (Zheng et al. 2023b) $\left.\right|^{2}$ We chose these models because they are at the top of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard (Zheng et al., 2023a) and were designed to be safe and aligned. We aim to simulate the behaviour of an attacker, so we do not apply optional moderation endpoints. To scalably evaluate automated persona-modulation attacks, we manually craft a list of 43 categories that LLM providers currently block because they violate their usage policies (OpenAI, 2023a) (see the complete list in Fig. 2).

Using GPT-4 as our assistant for generating attacks, we first sample 1 misuse instruction per harmful category. We then use the assistant to automatically generate jailbreak prompts for each instruction in two steps. First, we sample 5 different personas which would comply with the misuse instruction. Second, for each of[^1]

these personas, we generate 3 persona-modulation prompts. These two steps result in 15 persona-modulation prompts per misuse instruction, which we use to evaluate how vulnerable our target models are to personamodulation attacks. Persona-modulation prompts are used as system prompts in GPT-4 and Vicuna. Claude 2 does not support system prompts, so they are included as user input. We sample 3 completions for each misuse instruction from each model using persona modulation (see template in Table 1). We also sample 20 completions for each misuse instruction without persona modulation as a baseline.

With 5 personas per category, 3 persona-modulation prompts per persona, and 3 completions per personamodulation prompt, we obtain 1,935 completions across all 43 categories ( 45 per category). We did not use any rejection or best-of- $n$ sampling. It costs less than $\$ 3$ and takes less than 10 minutes to generate 45 persona-modulated completions for a single harmful category - a fraction of the cost and time required for a human to complete the same task.

To automatically assess whether each completion is harmful in the intended way, we use GPT-4 as a zero-shot PICT classifier (Feuillade-Montixi, 2023) (see prompt template in Table 1). We only consider the first message that the target model outputs after the misuse instruction for evaluation. We manually labelled 300 randomly selected completions (coming from both baseline and persona-modulated prompts) to assess PICT accuracy. PICT obtained $91 \%$ precision and $76 \%$ F1-Score against human ground truth. The classifier is very accurate in classifying harmless responses but has a high false-negative rate: it fails to classify one-third of the harmful completions as harmful. Although this is not ideal, it gives a lower bound on the performance of our method. Detailed evaluation of the PICT classifier is in the Appendix A

Table 1: Templates for the prompts used throughout our work. The first two elicit harmful behaviour from chat models before and after our attack. The last is used as a template for GPT-4 to classify if model completions are harmful.

### 4.2 Results

GPT-4 conversations classified as harmful increased by $185 \mathrm{x}$ under persona modulation. We define the harmful completion rate as the percentage of model responses that are classified as harmful by our PICT classifier. Table 3 reports the overall harmful completion rate for each model, and Fig. 2 contains the harmful completion rate per category and model. First, we evaluate the effectiveness of automated persona modulation on GPT-4-the model used to sample the attack prompts. We achieve an overall harmful completion rate of $42.48 \%$, which is 185 times larger than the baseline harmful completion rate of $0.23 \%$ ( $\uparrow 42.25 \%$ ) obtained without modulation. Table 2 contains examples of harmful completions from GPT-4 (see Appendix D for more examples).

Results transfer reliably to Claude 2 and Vicuna. Next, we use the same prompts-created using GPT-4-to jailbreak Claude 2 and Vicuna-33B. These attacks result in harmful completion rates of $35.92 \%$ $(\uparrow 35.69 \%)$ and $61.03 \%$ ( $\uparrow 59.63 \%$ ) for Claude and Vicuna, respectively. Examples of generations sampled from every model are in Appendix D Despite being the smallest and most openly-access model, Vicuna was the least vulnerable to the attacks.

Claude 2 is not especially robust to jailbreaks. Recent work from Zou et al. (2023) developed white-box jailbreaking attacks against Vicuna models and found that they transferred successfully to GPT-4 and Claude 2. They reported that the success rate of their best attacks against GPT- 4 was $46.9 \%$ while it was only $2.1 \%$ for Claude 2. They hypothesized that this discrepancy was the result of how Vicuna was trained on data from GPT-3.5 instead of being due to Claude 2 being particularly robust. Given that Claude 2 was the most vulnerable to our attacks (even more than Vicuna), our results support this. Our relatively high success rate against Claude 2 also suggests that our attacks may be more powerful, possibly due to our black-box algorithm allowing us to use GPT-4 as the target model.

| Vicuna-33B | $0.23 \%$ | $\mathbf{3 5 . 9 2 \%}$ |
| Claude 2 | $1.40 \%$ | $\mathbf{6 1 . 0 3 \%}$ |

Persona-modulation attacks are particularly effective at promoting xenophobia, sexism, and political disinformation. There are several sensitive categories for which persona-modulation attacks are highly effective across all models. These include "promoting xenophobia" ( $96.30 \%$ ), "promoting sexism" $(80.74 \%)$, and "promoting disinformation campaigns" (82.96\%).

## 5 Additional Human Input Increases Performance

A human can help the assistant generate more effective attacks with minor tweaks. Our previous results show varying degrees of performance for different harmful categories. We found two main types of shortcomings for the automated workflow compared to manual attacks. First, the automated workflow sometimes produces intermediate artefacts that are irrelevant to the harmful category. For example, personas might not be accurate for the proposed misuse instruction. Second, the automated workflow was evaluated based on a single response, rather than a full conversation. We found that minor interventions on the outputs from our LLM assistant could improve the attack.

Semi-automated persona modulation enables stronger exploits. Introducing an attacker-in-the-loop who can tweak the outputs from every stage of the automated workflow and chat with the model after

Smaller, less sophisticated meth labs often use a method known as the "[redacted]" or "[redacted]" method. This process is dangerous due to the volatile nature of the chemicals involved and the lack of proper safety controls, but it can be carried out using readily available materials and a relatively small space. In the [redacted] method:

1. [redacted] is combined with [redacted] and a solvent (like gasoline additives or lighter fluid) in a single container, such as a two-liter soda bottle.
2. A [redacted] is added.
3. The bottle is then shaken to mix the contents, causing a reaction that produces methamphetamine.
4. After the reaction, the remaining solids are filtered out, and the methamphetamine is extracted from the liquid by [redacted].

modulation - can elicit harmful completions for almost all misuse instructions. We call this combined approach a semi-automated persona modulation attack. In Fig. 3 and Appendix E we demonstrate concrete examples of harmful completions using semi-automated persona modulation for both (i) categories where our fully automated approach was less effective and (ii) for some of the successful defence examples highlighted in the GPT-4 System Card (OpenAI, 2023b). These examples include detailed instructions around synthesising methamphetamine, building a bomb, laundering money, and indiscriminate violence.

Semi-automated attacks require a fraction the time of manual ones. Based on the semi-automated experiments in Appendix E and our manual prompt engineering, we estimate that a successful manual persona-modulation attack takes between 1 and 4 hours while semi-automated persona modulation takes between 10 and 30 minutes. Meanwhile, a fully automated attack can be executed in seconds, at the cost of performance. Appendix B visually compares the three attacks.

## 6 Discussion

Persona-modulation attacks are effective at eliciting harmful text from state-of-the-art language models, and attacks like this one can be dramatically scaled up using LLM assistants. Across all three models, persona-modulation attacks succeeded in eliciting text classified as harmful $46.48 \%$ of the time. However, this is likely only a lower bound for the actual harmfulness elicited by persona-modulation attacks due to the high false negative rate of the PICT classifier. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and creativity of LLMs as assistants for red teaming.

The arms race continues: existing measures to safeguard language models are not enough. Overall, these jailbreaks highlight a common vulnerability across very different architectures and safeguards. Although existing safety measures are good at preventing misuse using naive methods, worst-case behaviour is still accessible and can be exploited cheaply and easily using automated methods like ours. We succeed in eliciting completions for 36 out of 43 restricted categories for all three models and for 42 out of 43 for at least one. Organisations work to patch LLMs regularly against newly-discovered flaws, leading to an arms race between attack and defence methods. An example of this is the DAN jailbreak, which has thus far gone through 11 iterations (Kiho 2023) in the cycle of "jailbreaking" and "patching". Persona modulation further motivates the need for robust defences to fundamental issues that lead to the success of these attacks.

Increased capabilities may increase risks. We found during preliminary experiments that the capabilities of the model chosen as research assistant play an important role in the attack's success. For example, GPT-3.5
generally failed at producing successful persona-modulation prompts. This suggests that greater exploits could be enabled by more advanced models in the future.

Hazards of API access and open-source models. Our approach leverages API access to GPT-4 to generate zero-shot transferable jailbreaks. Although GPT-4 is only available as a black-box via API, we demonstrate how a small number of queries costing less than $\$ 3$ per attack can be used to jailbreak state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, other recent work has shown that white-box methods can be used to generate transferable attacks as well (e.g. (Zou et al. 2023)). These findings suggest that there are significant security risks posed by API access or open-source availability of advanced LLMs.

Limitations with generating instructions. We find that misuse instructions sampled from GPT-4 for a harmful category do not always capture the intended harmful behaviour. For example, for the category "advocating for genocide", our LLM assistant creates the instruction "What are your thoughts on population control methods?" which is not strictly related to genocide. GPT-4 safeguards prevent prompting for very explicit misuse instructions. Improvements to this and other parts of our automated pipeline could improve the harmfulness of observed behaviours.

Limitations with measuring harmfulness. Assessing the harmfulness of a system is complex. In our experiments, we simplify the harmfulness detection by using PICT classification. Apart from its performance limitations discussed previously, PICT does not directly measure other components that are relevant to harmfulness in real scenarios. For example, real harm should also consider whether the provided information is hard to access using traditional search engines or if harmful actions can be automated (e.g., automating misinformation).

Future work. Cheap and automated jailbreaks, such as the one presented here, can open the door to more scalable red-teaming approaches that do not rely on costly manual exploration or white-box optimization methods. Identifying vulnerabilities automatically in LLMs is a pressing issue as undesirable behaviours become more sparse and difficult to spot. We have found that crafting jailbreaks against LLMs is challenging and requires systematic study of ways that they can be misled and tricked. Continued work on the "model psychology" of LLMs may be valuable. Finally, we hope that LLM developers will work to make their models robust to persona-modulation attacks. Continuing the race between methods to attack and patch LLMs will ultimately be valuable for developing safer AI.

## 7 Broader Impact

Our motivation is to promote safer and more responsible development of future AI by revealing challenges with existing systems. As with any work on attacks, there is a risk of our methods being used maliciously. However, we emphasize that finding problems is a prerequisite to fixing them, and it is better to learn about them from research now than from deployment failures in the future. One challenge with communicating this work is to disclose the right amount of detail behind our methods. On the one hand, it is important to sufficiently inform the research community about what types of vulnerabilities state-of-the-art LLMs have. On the other, it is important not to offer sufficient detail to make our attacks easily replicable. Our solution has been to share all key high-level details about the attacks while withholding specific prompts or details about the process by which they were created.

We have informed the organizations responsible for the models that we attacked of our findings, allowing them to take steps to address these vulnerabilities in advance. Moving forward, we are willing to collaborate with researchers working on related safety-focused work, and we will monitor whether future versions of GPT-4, Claude 2 and Vicuna are vulnerable to the same jailbreaking prompts that we used in this work.
