#### Abstract

This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of $87.10 \%$. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.


Keywords: UK Case Law, Computational Law, Summary Judgment, Large Language Models (LLMs), Legal Taxonomy[^0]

Case law in the United Kingdom (UK) is not labelled with keywords or topic classifications, meaning it can be challenging to research or analyse issues across a large volume of legal information. In various fields where large textual datasets prevail, topic modelling has proven to be an invaluable tool, offering insights into hidden thematic structures that underpin vast corpora. However, its application in the legal domain, particularly in analysing case law, remains underexplored. This paper introduces a pioneering approach to computational legal analysis by developing a functional taxonomy of legal areas and applying it to topic modelling of summary judgment cases in the UK.

Summary judgment is an important procedure used across almost all civil law procedures and courts, making it an ideal ground for topic classification. It allows courts to resolve cases efficiently without a full trial when there is "no real prospect" of success at trial and no other "compelling reason" for a trial. ${ }^{1}$ Although they are a key procedural tool in civil litigation, it is often used against self-represented litigants who may not have the legal knowledge to effectively defend themselves (Leitch 2018; Halligan 2022). The increasing use of summary judgments raises important concerns about balancing efficiency and fairness while also maintaining access to justice (Bronsteen 2007; Gelbach 2014). The aim of this study is to identify patterns and trends in the use of summary judgment to provide a clearer picture of its role in UK cases.

Despite the extensive application of topic modelling in other domains, the application of traditional topic model methods to legal data faces significant challenges. These methods often fail to capture the complex and nuanced nature of legal language and reasoning, underscoring a critical gap in current research methodologies. We test whether recent developments in large language models (LLMs) offer researchers a new avenue to undertake topic modelling. Using this novel method, we prompt an LLM to classify the topic of a court case by providing it with a taxonomy from which it must be selected, providing the full text of the case, and implementing a simple self-evaluation on the LLM response to improve its replies.

Our study addresses the following research questions:

1. How should a functional taxonomy of legal topic areas be defined?
2. Can LLMs effectively classify summary judgment case law by topic?
3. Can LLM-based topic modelling reveal themes and patterns within case law?

To answer these questions, we develop a new functional taxonomy of legal area topics and employ advanced techniques using LLM Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic 2024) over a dataset of 3078 UK summary judgment cases. The significance of this study lies in its dual contribution to both legal practice and academic research. By providing a detailed analysis of how summary judgment cases are distributed across time and legal subject matter, we offer unique insights that can influence future legal analyses and policymaking. Furthermore, this work lays a foundational methodology for subsequent research[^1]in computational legal studies, particularly in the development and application of AI-driven tools for legal document analysis.

Our contributions are as follows:

1. We have developed a functional taxonomy for legal topics tailored to the UK legal system and used it in our application of LLMs to classify legal corpora.
2. We present the first study on topic modelling summary judgment case law and the first paper to use an LLM to topic model legal corpora with a bespoke functional legal taxonomy. We demonstrate a high accuracy achieved with this method ( $87.10 \%$ overall).
3. Our analysis reveals critical trends and shifts in the application of the summary judgment procedure across time, courts and topics, offering valuable perspectives for legal scholars, practitioners and policymakers.
4. The methodology and findings presented here, including our taxonomy and prompt, lay a foundational framework for future research in legal AI. This includes the potential expansion of topic modelling techniques to other areas of law and the refinement of LLM applications in legal contexts.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the most recent literature on topic modelling in the legal domain. Section 3 introduces a new functional legal taxonomy for UK law. Section 4 details the curated dataset and describes the methodologies used for topic modelling, including approaches using the LLM, Claude Opus 3. Section 5 presents the outcomes of the topic modelling, offering insights into thematic patterns within summary judgment cases across time and courts. Section 6 interprets the findings, discusses their implications for both legal practice and academic research, and considers how these insights might influence future legal analyses and policymaking. Section 7 concludes.

## 2 Related Work

Topic modelling is a computational method for identifying topics within a large dataset. Traditional topic model methods involve a model grouping similar words into topics based on their distribution across a large volume of text. This usually requires a human expert to manually allocate topics to the 'bag of words' identified by the model (Chauhan and Shah 2021). Despite being a well-established method in computer science, it has only been recently adopted in legal research. Several papers have used traditional topic model methods, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), to analyse legal texts (Lu et al. 2011; Venkatesh and Raghuveer 2012; O'Neill 2016; Remmits 2017; Luz De Araujo and De Campos 2020; Izzidien et al. 2022; Razon et al. 2022; Salaün et al. 2022; Hemmat et al. 2023; Abeywardena 2023; Mohammadi et al. 2024).

Topic modelling, particularly through LDA, has become a prevalent method in the analysis of legal texts across various jurisdictions. This technique has been utilised to model case law from a range of courts, including the Australian High Court (Carter et al. 2016), Supreme Court of the Netherlands (Remmits 2017), Brazillian Supreme Court (Luz De Araujo and De Campos 2020), Philippine Supreme Court (Razon et al. 2022), Canadian Housing Tribunal (Salaün et al. 2022), UK contract law
cases (Izzidien et al. 2022), the UK Supreme Court and Sri Lankan Supreme Court (Abeywardena 2023) and the European Court of Human Rights (Mohammadi et al. 2024).

Luz De Araujo and De Campos (2020) performed an LDA on 45,532 cases that were manually annotated by the Brazillian Supreme Court experts. The paper compared LDA topic-based representations with traditional bag-of-words representations and demonstrated weighted F1 scores of 78.07 for the LDA, 89.22 for the TF-IDF, and 89.29 for word counts. The accuracy of LDA in representing legal cases was further evidenced by Razon et al. (2022), who found that the LDA topics match the cases they describe with $86.67 \%$ accuracy. Salaün et al. (2022) expanded their analysis to include LDA, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and BERTopic models. Following the BM25 proximity score, the LDA was the highest performing, with an F1 score of 53.2. By the SBERT cosine similarity metric, BERTopic achieved the highest score of F1 57.4. Their study also highlighted the difficulties in evaluating topics due to the necessity for manual classification prior to modelling. Manual classification may also vary by relevant legal and domain expertise (Remmits 2017).

While these studies demonstrate the utility of LDA in legal contexts, they also reveal limitations. Carter et al. (2016) observed the challenge of topic modelling arising from the difference between operational definitions within case law, which often diverge from theoretical and traditional understandings of legal areas. Further, Izzidien et al. (2022) discussed the challenges posed by the granularity of legal issues, which can lead to the generation of various subtopics, complicating the model's application. Similarly, Abeywardena (2023) needed to use multiple topics with often overlapping labels to accurately classify the LDA topics. Mohammadi et al. (2024) used an LDA model to analyse ECHR Article 8 decisions and judgments relating to eviction (identified by existing keywords), selecting the 17 most prominent topics based on the model's coherence scores and human judgment. The authors elaborated on these limitations: "LDA did not reveal more specific topics, such as evictions. Identifying these more specific subtopics would, however, be very useful for practitioners and researchers" (Mohammadi et al. 2024).

LDA topic modelling has also been applied to other legal texts, including UK legislation (O'Neill 2016), Latvian legal documents (Vīksna et al. 2020), French Parliamentary Debates (Bourgeois et al. 2022) and Iranian laws and parliamentary documents (Hemmat et al. 2023). Soh et al. (2019) evaluated various text classification techniques using a pre-labeled corpus of case law. Among the models tested, a linear support vector machine trained on topics extracted via LSA demonstrated a macro F1 score of 63.2 and a micro F1 score of 73.3. In Soh Tsin Howe (2024), BERTopic, alongside LSA, was employed to generate topics for a dataset encompassing domain name disputes and a canonical collection of cases from the European Court of Human Rights. LSA performed better, with the highest MDR (43.1\%) and AUROC (91.4\%). Aguiar et al. (2022) use BERTopic to build thematic models across Brazillian Supreme Court cases and relevant legislation. The paper shows a macro F1 score of 89.0, although it only categorises documents across five classes of the Brazil National Council of Justice: Common Civil Procedure, Execution of Extrajudicial Title, Criminal Action - Ordinary Procedure, Special Civil Court Procedure, Tax Enforcement; and the option for Other (which makes up $21.0 \%$ of the dataset). BERTopic was also used on 314 cases from the Cornell Legal Information Institute's Historic US Supreme Court Decisions repository. It achieved a semantic correspondence of

84.6\% between the topics generated and the documents they represent, as validated by expert evaluations (Silveira et al. 2021).

A critical component in the application of traditional topic modelling methods is the role of human annotators and human judgment. The process of topic allocation in these methods typically relies on the interpretation of a "bag-of-words" or vector representations derived from the text data. This exploratory process often results in a heterogeneous mixture of topic abstractions, where some topics are finely detailed while others may overlap, thereby compromising the orthogonality between topics. Further, the lack of agreement on how to choose the best models and evaluate results in topic modelling makes this analysis challenging (Rüdiger et al. 2022).

In the study by Wendel et al. (2022) on the German Federal Constitutional Court, the authors generated a topic model of decisions published from 1951 to 2017. To mitigate bias in topic interpretation, they consulted experts familiar with the court's decisions using a catalogue of questions to predict expected topics. The variability in experts' responses underscored the ambiguous nature of what precisely constitutes a topic. The study employed structural topic modelling as an initial step to define these topic terms and developed an 'area of law' to categorise and select specific legal areas. However, the overlapping and hierarchical nature of these areas underscored the complexities involved in creating a definitive taxonomy of law, leading to the conclusion that developing a comprehensive legal taxonomy was neither feasible nor necessary for their analytical purposes.

The observed limitations, including the variable accuracy of traditional topic modelling, if measured at all, and the prevalence of general and overlapping topics, have led us to pursue a new method. Traditional models like LDA, LSA and BERTopic have shown constraints in handling the nuanced complexity of legal texts. Traditional approaches to topic modelling also involve meticulous parameter tuning-selecting the number of topics and adjusting alpha and beta values-which can be both time and computationally intensive and susceptible to subjective biases in interpreting the outputs (Rüdiger et al., 2022). In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for instantaneous topic generation, which bypasses some of these challenges. Mu et al. (2024a) explain that the transformative nature of LLMs increases the model's "ability to comprehend context, nuances, and even subtle thematic undertones has been demonstrated in various NLP tasks, allowing for a richer and more detailed categorisation of topics".

While we have not identified any paper using LLMs to comprehensively topic model case law, recent papers have engaged with using LLMs instead of traditional NLP methods in areas outside of law.

A notable advancement in the field is presented by Wang et al. (2023), introducing PromptTopic, a three-stage topic modelling method that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to refine and categorise topics. The paper demonstrated comparable performance to established methods such as LDA, NMF and BERTopic, and even surpassed them in generating more meaningful topics upon qualitative assessments (Wang et al. 2023). Xu et al. (2023) propose a novel framework named DiffusionEnhanced Topic Modeling using Encoder-Decoder-based LLMs (DeTiME). DeTiME uses EncoderDecoder-based LLMs to produce improved clustering of embeddings to generate topics that exhibit enhanced semantic coherence.

One similar paper to our work by Drápal et al. (2023) proposed a framework using an LLM to perform thematic analysis of fact summaries from criminal court opinions regarding theft. The method involved collaboration between human legal experts and Chat-GPT4 to generate initial theme codes, search for themes and classify the data. Unlike our proposed method, the authors do not use the full text of case law nor do they propose a defined list of topics for the LLM to select from. The shift towards LLMs in legal topic modelling represents a significant evolution in computational legal studies.

## 3 Functional Legal Taxonomy

Understanding the topics addressed in court is important from multiple perspectives. For policymakers, recognising the areas most frequently litigated helps identify social conflicts and the role courts play in resolving them. For court administrators, insights into common legal topics assist in resource and capacity planning. Additionally, for those using AI to analyse court decisions, knowledge of prevalent legal topics aids in identifying gaps in training datasets, enhancing the predictive accuracy of relevant models. Assigning a topic to each case can improve the performance of classification models, particularly when predicting case outcomes. Using an LLM to extract principal legal features from a case allows for the automatic identification of the case's topic from a predefined list. By maintaining consistency through the predefined list of topics, the reliability of the classification is reinforced.

Currently, there is no standardised taxonomy of legal areas suitable for widespread application in topic modelling within the UK. Existing taxonomies, including the Standards Advancement for the Legal Industry (SALI) Taxonomy (SALI Alliance, n.d.), the Stanford Legal Design Lab's Legal Issues Taxonomy (LIST) (Stanford Legal Design Lab, n.d.), and theoretical work on legal taxonomies (Sherwin 2009) have informed the principles and details of our approach. However, existing taxonomies are often tailored to specific jurisdictions or legal fields and are, thus, not usefully applicable to UK law due to their narrow scope and regional focus. This applies, in particular, to the SALI and LIST taxonomies.

To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive taxonomy tailored to the UK legal system. This endeavour began in the absence of a universally accepted taxonomy among UK legal institutions such as ministries, courts or professional bodies like the Law Society or the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). Our review confirmed that no standardised classifications were available from educational institutions or for professional examinations like the Solicitors Qualifying Examination.

Our taxonomy adopts a functional approach, focusing on practical legal issues faced by citizens and businesses. A functional approach focuses on the effects of law in reality (Michaels 2013), thereby ensuring that the classifications reflect the interests and concerns of those concerned with the legal matter. Functional, as opposed to doctrinal, approaches capture what is relevant both for individuals and for their relationship to society and its institutions (Steffek 2013). Functional taxonomies also come with the advantage of facilitating cross-jurisdictional comparisons since they provide a yardstick external to local laws. Applying a functional methodology, we strive for clarity and differentiation, ensuring that the categories of our taxonomy are distinct and comprehensible.

As a starting point, we used The Law Society's list of areas of practice provided in its 'Find a Solicitor' service (The Law Society, n.d.). This service allows users to find solicitors based on their areas of practice. This fits well with our methodology since we are aiming for distinguishable areas of law from the perspective of real-world problems. However, this list needed to be amended as its focus is the practice of solicitors, while our aim is a taxonomy of legal areas for the entire UK legal system. Appendix B documents the 44 amendments we have made to The Law Society's areas of practice, resulting in a new and original taxonomy of 108 specific areas of law.

As a result, our taxonomy uses modern functional language bridging law and disputes in reality. Such a taxonomy is useful for both lawyers and laypersons, as the language used will be understood by both groups (cf. Salaün et al. 2022). Given its focus on modern law and reality, it is particularly well suited to represent more modern legal texts. The taxonomy might need to be adapted for legal documents based on language that is materially different from modern language, e.g., Medieval legal texts (cf. Grajzl and Murrell 2022).

The taxonomy ranges from 'Administrative and public law (PUB)' to 'Landlord and tenant - leasehold valuation (LLV)' and 'Travel and tourism (TAT)'. Each area is assigned a three-letter abbreviation for ease of reference. Where necessary, legal areas are further subdivided to capture more specific case types, such as various aspects of landlord and tenant law. We provide differentiations as required for legal areas that have a higher number of cases. Generally, each area that is further differentiated contains a general category, which allows for capturing cases that cannot clearly be assigned to one of the more specific areas. The 'Landlord and tenant' theme, for example, is further divided as follows:

- Landlord and tenant - general (LRG)
- Landlord and tenant - commercial (LCO)
- Landlord and tenant - leasehold valuation (LLV)
- Landlord and tenant - residential (LRE)

The specific areas of law are placed into one of the following overarching higher-level areas of law:

- Public law
- Dispute resolution law
- Commercial law
- Personal and consumer matters
- Criminal law
- International law

The full taxonomy is shown below in a radial plot (Figure 1).

## 4 Data and Methodology

### 4.1 Cambridge Law Corpus: Summary Judgment Cases

The data used for this study consists of UK case law from the Cambridge Law Corpus (Östling et al. 2023). ${ }^{2}$ While the Cambridge Law Corpus contains around 320,000 cases, we specifically use a subset containing only summary judgment cases that were published in Izzidien et al. (2024). The dataset contains 3,078 summary judgment cases across 30 courts and tribunals in the UK. Each case is held in extensible markup language (XML), including a set of tags stored in a Python pandas data frame. The tags include the court name, last date of the hearing's delivery, neutral citation, word count, court tier and the full text of the case.[^2]

While summary judgment procedures have existed since the 1800s, the modern procedure was redefined in the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, which entered into force on 26 April 1999. ${ }^{3}$ Therefore, the subset of summary judgment cases are only cases from 26 April 1999 to 7 June 2023.

### 4.2 Large Language Model: Claude 3 Opus

We use Claude 3 Opus, an LLM, to classify each summary judgment case with a topic from the functional legal taxonomy. There are two primary reasons for selecting Claude 3 Opus. According to Anthropic's model card for Claude 3 Opus, it demonstrates superior performance across several benchmarks compared to its predecessors and contemporaries (specifically GPT and Gemini). In addition, it has a 200,000 token context window, unlike GPT's 128,000 token context window, allowing us to work more easily with longer court judgments (Anthropic 2024a; Anthropic 2024b).

In a detailed comparison of Claude, GPT and Gemini models, it was found that Claude 3 Opus consistently outperforms the others across a spectrum of tasks, particularly those that test knowledge and reasoning abilities-key components in legal analysis. In benchmarks focused on general reasoning, Claude 3 Opus achieved $86.8 \%$, compared to GPT-4 at $86.4 \%$, GPT-3.5 at $70.0 \%$, Gemini 1.0 Ultra at $83.7 \%$ and Gemini 1.0 Pro at 71.8\%. Additionally, on benchmarks for reading comprehension, Claude 3 Opus achieved a score of $83.1 \%$, compared to GPT-4 at $80.9 \%$ and Gemini 1.0 Ultra at 82.4\%. Claude 3 Opus has also demonstrated strong performance on mixed evaluations and knowledge Q\&A (Anthropic 2024b). According to a study by Kevian et al. (2024), Claude 3 Opus not only excelled in general cognitive tasks but also demonstrated superior performance in specialised tasks such as control engineering. While not directly analogous to legal tasks, this ability to handle specialised domains suggests its potential effectiveness in nuanced legal topic classification.

### 4.3 Prompt development for topic classification

The development of an effective prompt for Claude 3 Opus in the classification of legal topics from summary judgment cases was a key step in our methodology. Drawing on recent advancements in prompt engineering and the self-referential capabilities of LLMs, our approach was guided by the prompt design elements set out here and further refined through our preliminary applications. ${ }^{4}$

Initially, we tasked Claude 3 Opus with the creation of a custom prompt designed to guide the classification of summary judgment cases. The prompt instructed the model to allocate each case to a specific legal topic from a provided list, requiring it to identify both primary and potentially secondary topics relevant to the case. The prompt was designed to include several key components:

1. Task framing and context setting: The prompt begins by clearly framing the task, instructing Claude 3 Opus to review the case details and assign the most fitting legal topics based on the functional legal taxonomy provided within the prompt.[^3]
2. Closed-set prompting: By using a closed-set prompting strategy, we constrained the model's responses to a predefined list of topics, enhancing the focus and accuracy of the output (White et al. 2023; Mu et al. 2024).
3. Instruction prompting: The prompt provides detailed instructions that guide the model in its task. The prompt also asks that the response meet the criteria and emphasises the importance of attention to detail (Chang et al. 2024).
4. Examples and constraints: The prompt explicitly listed the legal topics as selectable options, serving both as constraints and examples to aid the LLM in understanding the expected response format, adhering to the guidance from Anthropic's prompting guide (Anthropic 2023).
5. Encouraging reasoning and explanation: The LLM was prompted to provide reasoning and explanations for its topic selections, enhancing the transparency and traceability of its decisions. However, the level to which these forms of explanations correspond to the actual steps taken by the model remains an open question (Paul et al. 2024; Agarwal et al. 2024).
6. Contextual prompting: Additional contextual information relevant to topic modelling was incorporated to guide the LLM toward the desired output (Liu et al. 2021).
7. Few-shot prompting: The setup subtly introduced a few-shot learning approach by including a list of topics from which the LLM must choose Agrawal et al. (2022).

Following the initial prompt developed by Claude 3 Opus, feedback was solicited directly from the LLM, leading to additional refinements. Below are five suggestions provided by Claude 3 Opus that were incorporated into the final prompt.

1. Clarification of output format: Explaining that the number assigned to the topics was not part of the output format should help avoid confusion.
2. Emphasis on relevance: Specifying that the selected topics should be the most central to the case and that peripheral issues should not influence the topic allocation.
3. Request a confidence score: Including a request for a confidence score (e.g., on a scale of 1-5) for its topic allocation could help assess the reliability of its decision. This method, in principle, builds on earlier work in neural networks (Hendrycks \& Gimpel, 2018; Li et al. 2024). However, since LLMs generate their output sequence in an auto-regressive way, they do not directly produce a confidence score for the output sequence (Chen et al. 2023).
4. Introduction of an example: Defining a sample case and its corresponding topic allocation would be useful to serve as a reference point for Claude Opus.
5. Specification of response length: Indicating the desired length of Claude Opus's explanation for its topic selection should ensure a concise yet informative response.

The full prompt and exchange are in Appendix A. ${ }^{5}$

### 4.3.1 Initial legal expert checks on topic results

In our study, we conducted an initial evaluation of Claude 3 Opus's ability to classify the topics using a sample of 50 cases. This assessment aimed to identify the accuracy of the topic classifications made by the LLM and to pinpoint specific areas where the model's performance could be improved. ${ }^{6}$[^4]

The initial manual check revealed that 35 out of 50 cases (70\%) were classified correctly. However, 15 cases (30\%) presented issues with the classifications. First, three cases were incorrectly classified. Second, in several cases where the model had identified multiple relevant topics, the order of prioritisation of these topics or one topic being correct while another incorrect was identified as an issue. Therefore, the prompt was amended to remove the option for multiple topics. Third, we identified two cases that had used similar wording or abbreviations to the list of topics but were slightly different. To reduce instances of such hallucinations of the topic name, we incorporated the following additional instructions:

"Before providing your response, please ensure that the selected primary and secondary topics are actually present in the list of legal topics provided above. If the topics you have chosen are not found in the list, please reconsider your selection and choose topics that are included in the list that meet the description of the primary and secondary topic."

This modification mitigated the error rate and underscored the importance of iterative prompt refinement in the effective use of LLMs for legal topic classification.

### 4.3.2 Statistically significant legal expert checks on topic results

We then ran the final prompt across all cases, producing a classification from Claude 3 Opus. We then conducted manual checks on a sample. To ensure a statistically significant sample, we calculated a sample size of 342 cases for a 95\% confidence level with a 5\% margin of error for the 3,078 cases. Samples were randomly drawn from their respective datasets utilising Python's random number generator.

## 5 Results

### 5.1 Legal expert evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using a statistically representative sample of 342 cases to assess the performance of Claude 3 Opus in classifying legal topics. The legal expert evaluation revealed that Claude misclassified 53 cases, yielding an initial accuracy score of $84.50 \%$.

However, it was clear from the review of the cases and the assigned topics that several of these misclassifications involved only minor discrepancies in topic naming, while the general category was otherwise correct. For example, Claude 3 Opus classified a case as "Trusts (PCT)" when it should have followed the full language of the taxonomy being "Private client - trusts (PCT)" or should have classified it by the correct term "Public procurement (PRO)", but Claude had classified as just "Procurement (PRO)". Adjusting for these nine minor errors improves the accuracy to $87.10 \%$.

Three additional types of error were identified in the legal expert evaluation. First, there were 26 cases where the model had erroneously assigned primary topics that were incorrect while the secondary topics were correct. Common errors included where the secondary topic was "Contract (CTR)", but Claude had incorrectly identified the primary topic as "Dispute resolution - civil mediation (DRC)". Notably, 25 of these cases arose when the primary topic was one of the dispute resolution categories,
and only one was a case classified as "Company (COM)" when it should have been the secondary topic "Insolvency and restructuring - business (INS)". Such results suggest that the general nature of dispute resolution categories was unclear to the model.

Second, the model generated topics for 4 cases that were not part of the legal taxonomy provided. Each of these "hallucinated" topics is practically and contextually correct; they each were relevant and similar to topics from the taxonomy:

1. Classified as a hallucinated topic "Confidentiality (CON)". The correct topic from the taxonomy would be "Contract (CTR)" as it deals with a confidentiality agreement.
2. Classified as a hallucinated topic "Partnerships (PAR)". The correct topic from the taxonomy would be "Company (COM)" as it deals with issues of partnership liability in a company law context.
3. Classified as a hallucinated topic "Restitution (RES)". The correct topic from the taxonomy would be "Contract (CTR)" as restitution is a contract law remedy.
4. Classified as a hallucinated topic "Costs (COS)". The correct topic from the taxonomy would be "Litigation - general (LIG)" as costs are an element of general litigation.

Finally, 14 cases were incorrectly classified. Of these cases, the incorrect classifications were one of four topics: "Dispute resolution - civil mediation (DRC)" (7 misclassifications); "Dispute resolution - commercial mediation (DRO)" (1 misclassification); "Landlord and tenant - general (LRG)" (3 misclassifications), and "Landlord and tenant - residential (LRE)" (3 misclassifications). Similar to the above issues of primary and secondary topics, it appears these specific areas of law caused confusion in the model regarding their general nature.

### 5.2 Additional legal expert evaluations for topic hallucinations

Given the results on minor discrepancies in topic naming and hallucinations on topics, we compared the Claude topic output across the whole dataset with the taxonomy. We identified, in addition to the original 13 hallucinations identified above, 45 of the 3078 cases, which had also been classified with a topic not contained in the taxonomy (both minor and major hallucinations). This confirms that $98.28 \%$ of the Claude responses used the topics from the taxonomy.

In these secondary evaluations of these errors, similar issues arose, as described above. There were 5 cases that had the correct topic classification but were missing the relevant abbreviation, i.e., "Banking" instead of "Banking (BAN)". Additionally, 29 cases had minor hallucinations that were materially correct but had some semantic errors, i.e., "Fraud - crime (CRF)" instead of "Crime - Fraud (CRF), or "Trusts (PCT)" instead of "Private client - trusts (PCT)". Finally, there were 14 cases with major hallucinations. Similar to the above evaluation, these hallucinations were contextually correct but often hallucinating a more specific topic than was provided for by the taxonomy. For instance, cases classified as "Carriage of goods by sea (COG)" were corrected to "Commercial - general (COG)". Similarly, cases classified as "Civil procedure (CIP)", "Contempt of court (CON)", "Costs (COS)", and "Limitation (LIM)" were corrected to "Litigation - general (LIG)". Cases classified as "Confidential information (CFD)" and "Restitution (RES)" were corrected to "Contract (CTR)", while those classified as "Confidential information (CON)" were corrected to either "Intellectual property

(IPR)" or "Defamation (DEF)". Additionally, "Conflict of laws (COL)" was corrected to "Crossborder (CRO)", "Crime - blackmail (CRB)" was corrected to "Crime - general (CRG)", "Partnership (PRT)" was corrected to "Company (COM)", "Privacy (PRI)" was corrected to "Human rights (HRI)", and "Regulation - legal profession (REG)" was corrected to "Professional negligence (PNE)". These hallucinated topics can be understood as narrower constructions of specific legal issues under the broader topic outlined in our taxonomy. While not in the scope of this current research, we look forward to further work that considers why such hallucinations arise and how they can be avoided. We have manually corrected the topic for these 58 instances.

### 5.3 Visualised results

Once all manual checks were completed and hallucinations corrected, we used the final primary topic classifications to visualise the topic distribution across the summary judgment cases. We used the name of the court for each case, the date of hearing and the court tier list in Appendix 3 for our analysis. The following visualisations aid in understanding the trends and patterns in summary judgment cases. A detailed discussion of these results can be found in Section 6.1.

### 5.3.1 Proportions of topics within higher-level areas of law

First, we plot the number of summary judgment cases per higher-level areas of law. Figure 2 shows that commercial law is the dominant higher-level area of law, followed by dispute resolution, then personal and consumer matters. Criminal, public and international law have the fewest summary judgment cases.

Figure 2. Number of summary judgment cases per higher-level area of law

The following Figures 3 to 8 show the numbers of summary judgment cases per specific area of law grouped by the five higher-level areas. These visual representations provide a granular view of the distribution of cases, highlighting the prevalence and thematic concentration within each higher-level
area of law. This is key to understanding the judicial application of summary judgments in different contexts.

Figure 3 illustrates the breakdown of specific areas of law within the higher-level area of commercial law. It shows the highest concentration of cases in contract, followed by intellectual property, construction, company, banking, and professional negligence.

Summary judgment cannot be used in actual criminal cases; however, it can be used in civil proceedings following a criminal case. For example, a civil case running alongside a claim of fraud or a suit for damages for wrongful arrest. Figure 4 reveals primarily cases relating to fraud and general criminal topics. These are the most likely areas for summary judgment to overlap with a criminal law topic.

Figure 4. Number of summary judgment cases per specific area of criminal law

Figure 5 focuses on dispute resolution, highlighting arbitration, civil mediation and general litigation as the dominant topic areas. The data suggests the utilisation of summary judgments in scenarios where arbitration or mediation processes are either concluded or not feasible, prompting a judicial decision based on the available facts. This underscores the role of courts in affirming outcomes in alternative dispute resolution mechanisms or in deciding cases that may not require a detailed examination of complex evidentiary matters. It also shows its use in general litigation matters to resolve administrative matters such as determining costs, affirming judicial awards or remedies, and determining procedural issues.

### 5.3.2 Distribution of topics over time

In this section, we explore the temporal dynamics of summary judgment cases across various legal topics. The analysis is underpinned by visual representations that trace the frequency and distribution of cases across different periods. This temporal analysis is crucial for understanding trends, identifying emerging patterns and assessing the impact of legal and societal changes on the judicial processes. As explained in Section 4.1, the subset of summary judgment cases includes decisions between 26 April 1999 and 7 June 2023.

Figure 9 presents a line graph depicting the annual distribution of summary judgment cases within higher-level areas of law. This shows fluctuations and trends, including the predominance of commercial and dispute resolution law. It also shows a large spike in summary judgment cases that coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The temporal analysis of summary judgment cases across various legal topics provides a dynamic overview of how the legal landscape adapts over time. Further details are discussed in Section 6.1.

### 5.3.3 Distribution of topics across courts

This subsection examines the distribution of summary judgment cases across the courts. Figure 11 shows the number of summary judgment cases across all UK courts in the dataset. This reveals the top five courts for summary judgment cases are the England and Wales High Court, including the Chancery Division, Queen's Bench Division (now King's Bench Division), Commercial Court,

Technology and Construction Court, and Patents Court, and the England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division).

The visual analyses presented in Section 5.4 provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution and dynamics of summary judgment cases within the UK legal system, offering detailed insights into the prevalence and characteristics of these cases across different legal domains and courts. We now move into a more detailed discussion of these trends and insights into the topics of summary judgment cases.

## 6 Discussion

### 6.1 Landscape of summary judgment case law

Our findings illuminate the landscape of summary judgment cases in UK courts since its last major reform in 1999, revealing distinct patterns and trends across different legal domains and historical
periods. The utilisation of summary judgments has fluctuated in response to various factors, including legislative reforms, changes in procedural rules and broader socio-economic developments.

Our results indicate a significant predominance of commercial law in summary judgment applications, as shown in Figure 2. This trend underscores the critical role of summary judgments in resolving commercial disputes efficiently. Figure 3, in particular, shows the highest concentration of commercial law cases in contracts, followed by intellectual property, construction, company, banking, and professional negligence. Commercial disputes often involve significant financial stakes and, therefore, benefit from faster judicial processing to minimise business disruption and economic losses. Commercial law, including many contractual law issues, requires certainty and procedural simplicity, which heavily influences the frequent application of summary judgments in these areas (Halligan 2022). The construction of contractual documents, including issues of implied terms or contract variations, should be decided quickly through summary judgment, provided it is relatively straightforward (Sime 2022, 281).

Court efficiency is crucial in maintaining the flow of commerce and avoiding the economic stagnation that prolonged litigation can cause (Halligan 2022). This is particularly pertinent in sectors like construction, where project timelines and financing arrangements can be sensitive to delays. The England and Wales High Court (Technology and Construction Court) has "enthusiastically supported the use of applications for summary judgment to enforce the decisions of adjudicators" (Redmond 2001, 181). In particular, the summary judgment procedure allows an expedited timetable to resolve construction disputes and also shows the overlap with the dispute resolution topics.

Figure 5 shows the extensive use of summary judgments in resolving traditional litigation matters and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Arbitration procedures have been criticised as inefficient and expensive, and so the adoption of summary judgment procedures is one way to improve the practice (Chong and Primrose 2017).

Figure 7 shows that defamation is the most frequent summary judgment topic within personal and consumer matters. Defamation cases often require prompt resolution (May 1985). The potential immediate impact on reputation, risks of wider dissemination of defamatory statements and prevention of ongoing harm or loss often lead to the use of expedited procedures or remedies such as injunctive relief. Areas of personal injury are often complex with disputed factual issues, so it is rare for a court to award summary judgment for general negligence claims. It is also true that a court will not normally award summary judgment in favour of a lawyer who is sued for professional negligence (Sime 2022), ${ }^{7}$ although this area of law arises more frequently than more complex personal injury cases (compare Figure 3 and Figure 7).

Although summary judgment is not permitted in criminal trials due to the need for a full evaluation of evidence and a jury's determination of guilt, there is a significant presence of criminal-related topics[^5]in summary judgment cases within civil contexts (see Figure 4). When a defendant is convicted of a relevant offence, the civil courts may rely on this conviction to influence the adjudication of related civil claims. ${ }^{8}$ This essentially means the criminal conviction can be used as evidence in civil proceedings unless significant proof to the contrary is presented. However, courts remain cautious in granting summary judgment when the underlying criminal conduct involves elements of deceit, dishonesty or other unlawful actions, as the complexity of these issues often requires a thorough examination of evidence, which is better suited to a trial setting. ${ }^{9}$ An allegation of fraud can be a defence against a summary judgment application, particularly in the context of financial instruments like performance bonds. In scenarios involving claims of fraud, duress or illegality, the evidence must be particularly compelling to overcome the strong presumptions against summary judgment in such cases. ${ }^{10}$ Such detail explains the high prevalence of the topic of fraud in summary judgment cases.

The data indicates a prevalent use of the summary judgment procedure in courts that handle complex commercial disputes, including the England and Wales High Court divisions including the King's \& Queen's Bench, Chancery and England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil), as well as specialised courts including the Technology and Construction Court, Commercial Court and Patents Court (Figure 11). The procedural preference for summary judgments in these courts can be attributed to the nature of commercial litigation, which often involves clear-cut legal questions that can be decided without a full trial (Sime 2022; Halligan 2022). This aligns with the broader judicial aim to streamline litigation processes and reduce unnecessary legal expenses and court time, especially in high-stakes commercial matters where swift resolution is often paramount. However, Phillips (2005) has identified some of the risks of summary judgment in these disputes. While summary judgment is increasingly invoked in intellectual property disputes to avoid the length and expense of a full trial, unlike full trials normally heard by a specialist intellectual property judge, applications for summary judgment are "frequently heard by judges in the Chancery Division who may have little experience of the area" (Phillips 2005). This disparity can be seen between the 106 intellectual property cases before the England and Wales High Court (Chancery Division) (Figure 12) and the 41 intellectual property cases before the England and Wales High Court (Patents Court) (Figure 17). Law and policymakers need to consider the balance between effective and swift administration of justice and the need for specialised judicial practice.

A notable spike in summary judgment cases appeared in 2020, which highlights its dynamic usage in response to extraordinary circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 brought unprecedented challenges to judicial systems worldwide, including a significant increase in caseloads and a consequent backlog within the UK court system (Select Committee on the Constitution 2021). This surge likely reflects the courts' agility in utilising summary judgments to expedite dispute resolution during a period when traditional court operations were disrupted. The high[^6]use of summary judgments during the pandemic, however, also raises the question of whether summary judgments were handed down in cases that would have deserved a full trial.

### 6.2 Topic Hallucinations

Hallucinations present a significant challenge in the various applications of LLMs. LLMs compress vast amounts of training data into dense representations captured in the model's weights without storing verbatim text. This architecture predisposes LLMs to generate responses that approximate the context of a query but may inaccurately reflect the specifics of the training data, particularly under compression techniques that simplify the model's weights (Xu et al. 2024).

Despite recent interest in using LLMs in topic modelling (Wang et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2023), literature on effectively mitigating hallucinated topics remains largely unexplored. As outlined in Section 4.3, we have adapted some strategies from recent literature on managing hallucinations with LLMs.

We implemented a feedback mechanism whereby the LLM evaluates its own responses. Drawing from the work of Mu et al. (2024b), training a model to discern between relevant and irrelevant or hallucinated topics can be achieved based on direct feedback. By integrating this strategy, the LLM is systematically guided to align its outputs with predefined criteria, enhancing the accuracy of its topic classification. Although the application of such feedback mechanisms in legal topic modelling is novel, the principle of using feedback to refine LLM outputs has been implemented in Shinn et al. (2023). Yan and $\mathrm{Xu}$ (2023) developed an iterative optimisation framework that enhances LLM responses by incorporating evaluative prompts. Shinn et al. (2023) introduced a 'reflection’ strategy, where an LLM reviews and adjusts its answers based on previous outputs, fostering a self-corrective process.

These techniques are akin to instruction-tuning, where language models are fine-tuned on data described through specific instructions to improve their task performance (Wei et al., 2022). Our application of 'closed-set prompting'-a method where the LLM is presented with a predefined set of potential answers and selects the most appropriate one-is another form of this approach.

The ability of LLMs to comprehend and analyse complex, multidimensional legal texts offers a significant advantage over traditional methods. As Mu et al. (2024b) highlight, the transformative capabilities of LLMs extend beyond simple categorisation to grasp contextual nuances and thematic subtleties, allowing for a more detailed and nuanced classification of legal topics. However, ensuring the reliability of these models in legal applications also necessitates incorporating robust mechanisms to counteract hallucinations.

Although a contextual or theoretically limited taxonomy may present challenges to legal topic modelling (Grajzl and Murrell, 2022), our work to develop a functional and comprehensive legal taxonomy focused on UK courts has resulted in promising accuracy. Continued research into feedback mechanisms and reflective strategies will be crucial in advancing the practical applications of LLMs in legal topic modelling, reducing the occurrence of hallucinations, and enhancing the overall trustworthiness of topic-modelling legal corpora.

### 6.3 Limitations

While our study offers significant insights into the topic modelling of summary judgment cases using LLMs and a new legal taxonomy for UK law, it is not without limitations.

First, our analysis did not include a comparison with other language models such as GPT, Llama or Gemini, nor traditional topic modelling approaches such as LDA, NMF or LSA. While the LLM Claude 3 Opus showed promising results with an accuracy of $87.10 \%$, the absence of a comparative analysis limits our ability to contextualise these findings within the broader landscape of topic modelling techniques. Future research could benefit from a comparative study to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of various models in the context of legal document analysis.

Second, our study was based on a relatively small sample size of 3078 summary judgment cases. Although this dataset is substantial within the specific context of UK summary judgments, it may not fully capture the diversity and complexity of all legal cases. A larger dataset could provide more robust insights and allow for more generalisable conclusions. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include cases from other jurisdictions or different types of legal documents could enhance the applicability of our findings.

Third, our methodology involved the manual evaluation of a subset of cases to verify the accuracy of the LLM's topic classifications. While this approach was necessary to assess the model's performance, it introduces a degree of subjectivity. The evaluation process relied on the judgment of legal experts, which, although informed, is inherently subjective and may vary among different evaluators. Future studies could aim to develop more objective and automated evaluation metrics to complement human assessments.

In summary, while our study contributes to the field of computational legal studies by demonstrating the potential of LLMs in topic modelling, it also highlights the need for further research to address these limitations. Comparative analyses with other models, larger and more diverse datasets, objective evaluation methods, and testing across different types of legal cases are recommended to build on the findings of this study.

## 7 Conclusion

This study has successfully applied emerging techniques for LLM-based topic modelling to UK summary judgment cases. By developing and applying a functional taxonomy, we have enhanced the precision of topic classification, offering a nuanced view of legal topics and their applications in summary judgments. Our research highlights the robust potential of LLMs in handling complex legal texts and providing accurate classifications, achieving an accuracy of $84.50 \%$ and, when adjusted for minor errors, an accuracy of $87.10 \%$.

The findings of this study reveal significant trends across different legal domains, notably in commercial and dispute resolution laws, and underscore the prevalent use of summary judgments in these areas. These insights are crucial for legal professionals and policymakers aiming to optimise
judicial processes and balance the efficiency of legal proceedings with the fairness and accessibility of justice. Our research also underscores the ongoing challenges and limitations associated with topic modelling in the legal field, particularly the occurrence of topic hallucinations and the nuanced understanding required to interpret legal language correctly.

Looking forward, this work lays a solid foundation for further exploration and refinement of computational methods in legal analytics. The proposed methodology and the developed taxonomy of legal areas provide a framework that can be extended to other areas of law, potentially revolutionising how legal data is processed and understood. Our study not only sheds light on the dynamics of summary judgment usage in UK courts but also underscores the importance of continuous evaluation of procedural laws to balance the goals of efficiency and justice in the legal system.

## Appendix A: Prompt

## A. 1 Final Prompt

"Dear Claude Opus,

I would like you to carefully review the details of a legal case that has been filed by a judge. After analyzing the facts and legal issues involved, please determine the most appropriate primary topic that the case falls under, based only on the following comprehensive list of legal topics:

$\{2$ " ".join(legal_topics) $\}$

If the case involves multiple legal issues, please identify one primary topic that is most central and relevant to the case. Avoid selecting a topic that is only tangentially related or a peripheral issue. The topic description should provide sufficient information for a judge to properly classify the case.

After determining the primary topic, please consider whether the case can also be categorized under any secondary topics from the legal topics list above only. If so, include the most relevant secondary topic. If there are no applicable secondary topics, simply state 'none'.

Before providing your response, please ensure that the selected primary and secondary topics are actually present in the list of legal topics provided above. If the topics you have chosen are not found in the list, please reconsider your selection and choose topics that are included in the list that meet the description of the primary and secondary topic.

Please format your response as follows:

Primary topic: [topic 1]

Secondary topic: [topic] or none

In your response, please provide a brief explanation (around 10 words) of your reasoning and cite any relevant legal principles or precedents that support your decision. Use the format: [Explanation: ]. Additionally, include a confidence score (1-5, with 5 being the most confident) for your topic allocation. Use the format: [Confidence score: ]

Thank you for your thorough analysis and attention to detail in this matter.

Case details:

\{case \}"

## A. 2 Developing Prompt with Claude 3 Opus

## User:

I want you to write a Claude Opus custom made prompt.

The prompt is to consider a case filled by a judge. Then it is to allocate it to a specific topic.

The list of topics are given below:

[the full list was inserted here, each topic was pre-fixed with a number from 1 to 6 indicating which group it belonged to in terms of wider area of law. A carriage return after each topic was used, for example:

1 Administrative and public law (PUB)

2 Advocacy (ADV)

3 Agriculture (AGR)

## 3 Animals (ANI)]

Please note that topics that have common numerals indicate that they share the same general topic of law. I want you to craft a prompt to ask Claude Opus whether a case belongs to any one of the topics. then ask it again if the same case can be categorized in another secondary topic. For example, the case may be primary about two topics and not just one. You must avoid selecting topics that are not central to the case, i.e., a good topic description would be sufficient information to properly classify a case by a judge.

Output the response by giving the primary topics (without a number) followed by a comma then the secondary topic if there is one. If there is no secondary topic, simply output the word 'none'.

please format the prompt to be legally correct in language too.

The prompt must list all of the above areas of law in it, and the topic selection must come from it and from nowhere else.

Once you have selected the topic, perform a form of test to ensure it is correct, suggest a method please.

## User:

Is there anything I am missing to improve this?

## Claude 3 Opus:

Your prompt is quite comprehensive and well-structured. However, there are a few minor adjustments you could make to further improve it:

1. Clarify the output format: Specify that Claude Opus should provide the primary and secondary topics without their corresponding numbers to avoid any confusion.
2. Emphasize the importance of selecting the most relevant topics: Stress that the selected topics should be the most central and relevant to the case, and that peripheral issues should not influence the topic allocation.
3. Request a confidence score: Ask Claude Opus to provide a confidence score (e.g., on a scale of 15) for its topic allocation, which could help assess the reliability of its decision.
4. Provide an example: Include a sample case and its corresponding topic allocation to serve as a reference point for Claude Opus.
5. Specify the response length: Indicate the desired length of Claude Opus's explanation for its topic selection to ensure a concise yet informative response.

Here's the revised prompt incorporating these suggestions:
