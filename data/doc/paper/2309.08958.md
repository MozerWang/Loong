#### Abstract

Foundational large language models (LLMs) can be instruction-tuned to perform opendomain question answering, facilitating applications like chat assistants. While such efforts are often carried out in a single language, we empirically analyze cost-efficient strategies for multilingual scenarios. Our study employs the Alpaca dataset and machine translations of it to form multilingual data, which is then used to tune LLMs through either low-rank adaptation or full-parameter training. Under a controlled computation budget, comparisons show that multilingual tuning is on par or better than tuning a model for each language. Furthermore, multilingual tuning with downsampled data can be as powerful and more robust. Our findings serve as a guide for expanding language support through instruction tuning.


## 1 Introduction

Language capacity has attracted much attention in pre-trained language models. Some pioneering works focused on a single language (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019), while later works aim to cover multiple languages (Conneau et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). In the recent blossom of open-source LLMs, English-centric ones include GPT-2, LLaMA, and Pythia (Radford et al., 2019; Touvron et al., 2023; Biderman et al., 2023), and multilingual ones are represented by BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022). Multilingual models seem attractive when considering operational costs, cross-lingual transfer, and low-resource languages (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019; Wu and Dredze, 2020), yet English-centric models can possess good multilingual transferability (Ye et al., 2023).

Instruction tuning makes LLMs follow and respond to inputs (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).[^0]

With multilingual instruction data becoming feasible and available, this paper compares monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning applied to English-centric and multilingual LLMs to search for the optimal strategy to support multiple languages. Unlike prior works on multilingual multiNLP-task tuning (Mishra et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023), we focus on open-ended question answering under language generation.

Our data setting combines two low-cost practices: self-instruct, which distils data from a powerful LLM (Wang et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023) and the idea of leveraging machine translation to create multilingual datasets (Muennighoff et al., 2023). We fine-tune several decoder LLMs with either full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) or low-rank adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al., 2022) with different language combinations. Our experiments feature a fixed computation budget to offer practical insights. It is shown that multilingual tuning is preferred to monolingual tuning for each language under LoRA, but the results are mixed under FFT. English-tuned LLMs are not well-versed in responding in other languages, whereas a downsampled multilingual tuning scheme proposed by us is more robust. Finally, we examine our model performance on unseen languages and various LLMs of roughly the same size.

## 2 Methodology

### 2.1 Instruction data

We use the Alpaca dataset as a seed to create a multilingual instruction-response dataset. We used the cleaned version with $52 \mathrm{~K}$ instances ${ }^{1}$ and machinetranslated it into eight languages: Bulgarian, Czech, Chinese, German, Finnish, French, Russian, and Spanish, using open-source translation systems. ${ }^{2}$[^1]

### 2.2 Budget-controlled instruction tuning

For monolingual tuning, we tune LLMs for each language separately, whereas for multilingual tuning, we merge and shuffle the data in all languages. This allows for resource-controlled comparisons between monolingual and multilingual tuning, where a fixed (and equal for each language) computation budget is allocated to support all languages of interest. Experimental resource usage is described as follows:

1) Let $C_{\text {Alpaca }}$ denote the cost of monolingual Alpaca fine-tuning for a single language, then it costs $N \times C_{\text {Alpaca }}$ to tune individual models to support $N$ languages.
2) Multilingual instruction tuning will cost $N \times C_{\text {Alpaca }}$ too, as it trains on data available in all $N$ languages in one go.

We can fairly compare LLMs trained via 1) and 2) for any language. In addition, we propose to benchmark two budget-saving options which cost the same $C_{\text {Alpaca }}$ as a monolingual Alpaca:

3) As a simple baseline, we use an English-tuned model to respond to all languages.
4) Downsampled multilingual: we randomly sample from the multilingual data in 2) to have the size of a monolingual dataset.

Our study covers two training paradigms: low rank adaptation and full-parameter fine-tuning Both fine-tune an LLM with the causal language modelling objective on the instruction-response data, with hyperparameters listed in Appendix A.1. Five LLMs are involved: Baichuan-2, BLOOM, LLaMA, OpenLLaMA, and Pythia, aiming to test with different language coverage in the base LLMs Pythia, LLaMA, and OpenLLaMA are predominantly English, while Baichuan-2 and BLOOM are more versatile. A detailed description of the LLMs is in Appendix A.2.

### 2.3 Evaluation setup

Test data Our instruction-tuned LLMs are benchmarked on languages both seen and unseen during fine-tuning. We employ native speakers to manually translate 50 prompts sampled from OpenAssistant (KÃ¶pf et al., 2023) into eight languages: six seen during training and two unseen. The seen category includes English, French, Spanish, Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese. Among the six, English is the highest-resourced, followed by French and Spanish which share the same script as English. Bulgarian and Russian are European languages but use a writing system distinct from English. Finally, Chinese is a high-resource distant language in a different script. For unseen tests, we pick Bengali and Norwegian. Bengali is distant from the above languages and uses a different script, whereas Norwegian is under-resourced but overlaps with English writing script to some extent.

LLM-as-a-judge To avoid expensive evaluation costs, we adopt LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) to assign a score ( 1 to 3 ) to each instructionresponse pair, and the final model score is the sum of its scores across all test instances. We use GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) as the judge; it is queried with an instruction-response pair each time without model information or request history. We make modifications to Zheng et al. (2023)'s prompt to ask the LLM to consider that an answer should be in the same language as the question, which is often the expectation with AI assistants. ${ }^{3}$ The exact wording is as Appendix B. 1 Figure 6.

Language (in)consistency Our manual inspection suggests that GPT-3.5 does not always obey the language requirement imposed. An example in Appendix B. 2 Table 2 shows a response in another language but scored highly. Hence, we run language identification and force-set a score to 0 if the response language is different from the query. We use the fastText framework (Joulin et al., 2017) with Burchell et al. (2023)'s checkpoint. The final response score can be framed as a product of GPT's quality score and a binary language identification outcome: score $=$ eval_score $\times$ lang_id. The aggregated test score thus ranges from 0 to 150 .

Human-LLM agreement We pick 600 outputs from 12 models to cover multilingual and monolingual systems and invite human evaluators to score each sample with an instruction similar to the LLM-as-a-judge prompt as in Appendix B.3. Four languages-English, Spanish, Bulgarian, and Chinese-are human-evaluated, and we obtain very high system-level Pearson correlation coefficients of $0.9225,0.9683,0.9205$, and 0.8685 , respectively between GPT-3.5 and human. Details are in Table 3 in the appendix. This indicates the reliability of using LLM-as-a-judge to draw meaningful findings.[^2]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_621040288a12b44f8c95g-03.jpg?height=1092&width=782&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=246)

## 3 Performance and Discussions

### 3.1 Model sizes

Results from LoRA fine-tuning of BLOOM at different sizes are shown in Figure 1. At smaller sizes, multilingual $(-)$ and monolingual $(*)$ instruction tuning attain similar performance, and at larger sizes, multilingual models are generally better except for English. We observe similar trends for Pythia, placed in Appendix C. 1 Figure 8 due to space constraints. Moving on to full-parameter fine-tuning of BLOOM in Figure 2, we discover that at relatively small $(<1.7 \mathrm{~B}$ ) or large sizes (7B), monolingual models are generally better than multilingual models for individual languages. These observations suggest that multilingualism works well with LoRA, but separate monolingual tuning might be better with FFT. Overall, the LLMs' performance is correlated with sizes regardless of the tuning technique as anticipated.

### 3.2 Budget-efficient tuning

To aid our exploration of resource-constrained instruction tuning, in the aforementioned Figures 1, 2 , and 8 (in appendix C.1), we add the plots of two budget data conditions: using English-tuned mod-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_621040288a12b44f8c95g-03.jpg?height=996&width=784&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1064)

els to respond to instructions in other languages $(--)$, as well as instruction tuning with downsampled multilingual data $(\triangle \triangle)$.

When using a single English model for all languages, its efficacy depends on the intended language/script's closeness to English: Spanish and French can maintain reasonable scores, but Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese record very low performance. The only exception is BLOOM FFT in Figure 2, where the model is not too behind when operating in Chinese. Interestingly, BLOOM with LoRA sees a performance spike at 1.1B for nonEnglish. At this specific size, it displayed multilingual transferability from pre-training and learned to follow multilingual instructions despite being fine-tuned merely in English.

In contrast, while consuming the same computational resources, downsampled multilingual tuning is significantly more robust across all test languages. These models sometimes achieve on-par performance with monolingual tuning in individual languages. This means that to support several languages with limited resources, the best practice is to train on small multilingual data even created with machine translation instead of full English data. Nonetheless, if the budget permits, training with the full multilingual data is still slightly better.

### 3.3 Unseen languages

Further in Figure 3, we look at BLOOM models which underwent LoRA or FFT but were subsequently instructed in unseen languages at test time. English-tuned LLMs behave distinctly with LoRA and FFT. With the former, they are nowhere near multilingual tuned models, but with the latter, we see close or even better results. It might imply that FFT can even lift performance for languages not present in the instruction data. However, FFT results on Norwegian could be an outlier given its comparably low scores. Considering multilingual instruction tuning, we notice a pattern opposed to that on languages seen during training-learning on the downsampled data is superior to ingesting the full mixed data. We conclude that it is important to not overfit to instruction languages if unseen languages are expected in downstream tasks.

### 3.4 Language robustness

We review each model and data recipe's scores before and after adding language identification, to isolate an LLM's language robustness from its "inherent quality" (regardless of the response language). We compute the differences in GPT evaluation scores before and after applying language identification. A (big) difference suggests that a model produces reasonable answers in an undesired language. In Figure 4, we report the average of the score differences across all six test languages seen during tuning. English-only models are the least robust-their score differences are way above other techniques. With LoRA, full multilingual tuning records the smallest performance drop; with FFT,

Figure 4: Evaluation score change before and after language identification, averaged over six seen test languages, at different LLM sizes. Caption: training method and base model; y-axis: score difference (log scale); x-axis: model size (B).

monolingual tuning is preferred. The insights from language robustness are corroborated by our early findings in Section 3.1: superior results are obtained when using multilingual tuning with LoRA and monolingual tuning with full-parameter tuning. Nonetheless, monolingual and multilingual tuning are not too far apart; specifically for BLOOM with LoRA, language robustness does not improve as the model gets larger.

### 3.5 Model families

Finally, we experiment with base LLMs from different families of around 7 billion parameters. In Figure 5, we plot the evaluation scores for multilingual, downsampled multilingual, and monolingual LoRA tuning for six languages. Generally, LLaMA and OpenLLaMA have better performance than BLOOM and Pythia potentially because they have pre-training data that is an order of magnitude larger. Also Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese see lower scores than English, again presumably due to the language distribution in the pre-training data.

Delving into the comparison between monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning, we find that out of 30 cases across six languages and five LLMs, monolingual tuning is ahead in just two cases: LLaMA tested in Russian and Chinese. The cost-efficient downsampled multilingual tuning leads in four cases: two in French and two in Russian. In other situations, multilingual training is on par if not better. The outcome of tuning several similar-sized LLMs confirms that multilingual tuning is favourable using LoRA.

## 4 Related Work

Many large language models appeared recently: the closed-source GPT model family (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022); open-source English-centric models like LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023); open-source multilingual models like mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022). These models have exhibited different degrees of language versatility.

LLM pre-training data is usually skewed towards English. One way to improve an LLM's coverage of non-English languages is through continued pretraining (Cui et al., 2023, inter alia). Another rich body of literature looks into multilingualism in instruction tuning, which is used to adjust base models to respond to input (Mishra et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023). It trains an LLM by providing downstream tasks' input and output in a specific format. Early research created a multilingual instruction dataset using machine translation and showed that multilingual tuning gained higher performance than English-only fine-tuning (Muennighoff et al., 2023). They also found that low-cost translated instructions are superior to human-written non-English prompts on multiple language understanding tasks.

Lately, multiple contemporaneous papers delv- ing into multilingual instruction tuning have been made public on arXiv-some appeared before our work and some after. This reflects the importance and interest in widening LLMs' language support. Li et al. (2023a) created an instruction dataset with instructions translated from English but responses generated by an LLM. When tuned with LoRA, their monolingual models outperform multilingual ones on language understanding tasks. Wei et al. (2023) created a multilingual counterpart of Alpaca using self-instruct. It has also been showcased that translation instructions improve cross-lingual capabilities (Li et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023; Ranaldi et al., 2023) and research explored more crosslingual task data and multilingual tuning (Zhu et al., 2023). Moreover, researchers have unveiled that fine-tuning on a modest number of languagesapproximately three-seems to effectively instigate cross-lingual transfer in downstream tasks (Kew et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2024).

## 5 Conclusion

This paper presents a study of instruction tuning of large language models in different language contexts. Our study in a resource-controlled setting suggests that multilingual tuning offers more benefits compared to monolingual tuning. We find that multilingual tuning on a downsampled dataset achieves better robustness on unseen languages.

## Limitations

The LLMs we studied have primarily 7B and at most 13B parameters and the multilingual training only spanned nine languages. Scaling to larger models and more languages would be interesting. The best checkpoint for our instruction fine-tuning is selected based on validation cross-entropy, but there is no guarantee that this leads to the best performance on the downstream task.

To manage the budget for human translation and evaluation, we consider eight languages (six seen and two unseen languages during instruction tuning) to translate and sample 50 instances for evaluation. The training data for non-English languages are obtained via machine translation, which introduces errors, affects response fluency, and might alter the nature of some tasks such as grammatical error correction and code generation.

## Ethics Statement

The dataset we translated and generated does not contain private or sensitive information. Similar to other research on large language models, there is no definitive way for us to prevent the instructiontuned models from generating inappropriate content. However, we see minimal such risks associated with our project, as neither our models nor generated contents are intended for public consumption. Human evaluators did not report inappropriate content generated by the models.
