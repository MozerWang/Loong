#### Abstract

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used offline preference optimization algorithm that reparameterizes reward functions in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance simplicity and training stability. In this work, we propose SimPO, a simpler yet more effective approach. The effectiveness of SimPO is attributed to a key design: using the average log probability of a sequence as the implicit reward. This reward formulation better aligns with model generation and eliminates the need for a reference model, making it more compute and memory efficient. Additionally, we introduce a target reward margin to the Bradley-Terry objective to encourage a larger margin between the winning and losing responses, further enhancing the algorithm's performance. We compare SimPO to DPO and its latest variants across various state-of-the-art training setups, including both base and instruction-tuned models like Mistral and Llama3. We evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and the recent challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Our results demonstrate that SimPO consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches without substantially increasing response length. Specifically, SimPO outperforms DPO by up to 6.4 points on AlpacaEval 2 and by up to 7.5 points on Arena-Hard. Our top-performing model, built on Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a remarkable 44.7 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2-surpassing Claude 3 Opus on the leaderboard, and a 33.8 win rate on Arena-Hard-making it the strongest 8B open-source model. ${ }^{1}$


## 1 Introduction

Learning from human feedback is crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions [47], ensuring they are helpful, honest, and harmless [5]. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) $[15,58,69]$ is a popular method for fine-tuning language models to achieve effective alignment. While the classical RLHF approach [58, 66] has shown impressive results, it presents optimization challenges due to its multi-stage procedure, which involves training a reward model and then optimizing a policy model to maximize that reward [12].

Recently, researchers have been exploring simpler offline algorithms. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [62] is one such approach. DPO reparameterizes the reward function in RLHF to directly learn a policy model from preference data, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model.It has gained widespread practical adoption due to its simplicity and stability. In DPO, the implicit reward is formulated using the log ratio of the likelihood of a response between the current policy model and[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_1d169d40bb987975c359g-02.jpg?height=290&width=1398&top_left_y=236&top_left_x=362)

the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model. However, this reward formulation is not directly aligned with the metric used to guide generation, which is approximately the average log likelihood of a response generated by the policy model. We hypothesize that this discrepancy between training and inference may lead to suboptimal performance.

In this work, we propose SimPO, a simple yet effective offline preference optimization algorithm (Figure 1). The core of our algorithm aligns the reward function in the preference optimization objective with the generation metric. SimPO consists of two major components: (1) a lengthnormalized reward, calculated as the average $\log$ probability of all tokens in a response using the policy model, and (2) a target reward margin to ensure the reward difference between winning and losing responses exceeds this margin. In summary, SimPO has the following properties:

| Model | LC (\%) | WR (\%) | Len. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| GPT-4 Turbo (04/09) | 55.0 | 46.1 | 1802 |
| GPT-4 Turbo (11/06) | 50.0 | 50.0 | 2049 |
| Llama3-Instruct-8B-SimPO | 44.7 | 40.5 | 1825 |
| Claude 3 Opus | 40.5 | 29.1 | 1388 |
| Llama3-Instruct-8B-DPO | 40.3 | 37.9 | 1837 |
| Llama3-Instruct-70B | 34.4 | 33.2 | 1919 |
| Llama3-Instruct-8B | 26.0 | 25.3 | 1899 |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo (06/13) | 22.7 | 14.1 | 1328 |

- Simplicity: SimPO does not require a reference model making it more lightweight and easier to implement compared to DPO, and other reference-dependent approaches.
- Significant performance advantage: Despite its simplicity, SimPO significantly outperforms DPO and its latest variants (e.g., a recent reference-free objective ORPO [38]). The performance advantage is consistnt across various training setups and extensive instruction-following benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 [51,24] and the challenging Arena-Hard [50] benchmark. It achieves up to a 6.4 point improvement on AlpacaEval 2 and a 7.5 point improvement on Arena-Hard.
- Minimal length exploitation: SimPO does not significantly increase response length compared to the SFT or DPO models (Table 1), indicating minimal length exploitation [24, 67, 78].

Extensive analysis shows that SimPO utilizes preference data more effectively, leading to a more accurate likelihhod ranking of winning and losing responses on a held-out validation set, which in turn translates to a better policy model. As shown in Table 1, we produce a top-performing model, built on top of Llama3-8B-instruct, that achieves a notable 44.7 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2, outperforming Claude 3 Opus on the leaderboard, and a 33.8 win rate on Arena-Hard, making it the strongest $8 \mathrm{~B}$ open-source model to date.

## 2 SimPO: Simple Preference Optimization

In this section, we first introduce the background of DPO (\$2.1). Then we identify the discrepancy between DPO's reward and the likelihood metric used for generation, and propose an alternative reference-free reward formulation that mitigates this issue (\$2.2). Finally, we derive the SimPO objective by incorporating a target reward margin term into the Bradley-Terry model (\$2.3).

### 2.1 Background: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

DPO [62] is one of the most popular offline preference optimization methods. Instead of learning an explicit reward model [58], DPO reparameterizes the reward function $r$ using a closed-form
expression with the optimal policy:

$$
\begin{equation*}
r(x, y)=\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y \mid x)}{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}(y \mid x)}+\beta \log Z(x) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\pi_{\theta}$ is the policy model, $\pi_{\text {ref }}$ is the reference policy, typically the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model, and $Z(x)$ is the partition function. By incorporating this reward formulation into the BradleyTerry (BT) ranking objective [10], $p\left(y_{w} \succ y_{l} \mid x\right)=\sigma\left(r\left(x, y_{w}\right)-r\left(x, y_{l}\right)\right)$, DPO expresses the probability of preference data with the policy model rather than the reward model, yielding the following objective:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{DPO}}\left(\pi_{\theta} ; \pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\right)=-\mathbb{E}_{\left(x, y_{w}, y_{l}\right) \sim \mathcal{D}}\left[\log \sigma\left(\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}-\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)}\right)\right] \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\left(x, y_{w}, y_{l}\right)$ are preference pairs consisting of the prompt, the winning response, and the losing response from the preference dataset $\mathcal{D}$.

### 2.2 A Simple Reference-Free Reward Aligned with Generation

Discrepancy between reward and generation for DPO. Using Eq. (1) as the implicit reward expression have the following drawbacks: (1) the requirement of a reference model $\pi_{\text {ref }}$ during training incurs additional memory and computational costs, and (2) there is a discrepancy between the reward being optimized during training and the generation metric used for inference. Specifically, during generation, the policy model $\pi_{\theta}$ is used to generate a sequence that approximately maximizes the average log likelihood, defined as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{\theta}(y \mid x)=\frac{1}{|y|} \log \pi_{\theta}(y \mid x)=\frac{1}{|y|} \sum_{i=1}^{|y|} \log \pi_{\theta}\left(y_{i} \mid x, y_{<i}\right) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Direct maximization of this metric during decoding is intractable, and various decoding strategies can be used to approximate it, such as greedy decoding [30], beam search [31, 49], nucleus sampling [35], and top- $k$ sampling $[26,36,61]$. Additionally, this metric is commonly used for ranking options in multiple-choice tasks within language models $[11,37,58]$. In DPO, for any triple $\left(x, y_{w}, y_{l}\right)$, satisfying the reward ranking $r\left(x, y_{w}\right)>r\left(x, y_{l}\right)$ does not necessarily mean that the likelihood ranking $p_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)>p_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)$ is met. In fact, only roughly $50 \%$ of the triples from a held-out set satisfy this condition when trained with DPO (see Figure 4b).

Length-normalized reward formulation. Naturally, we consider replacing the reward formulation in DPO with $p_{\theta}$ in Eq. (3), so that it aligns with the likehood metric that guides generation. This results in a length-normalized reward:

$$
\begin{equation*}
r_{\mathrm{SimPO}}(x, y)=\frac{\beta}{|y|} \log \pi_{\theta}(y \mid x)=\frac{\beta}{|y|} \sum_{i=1}^{|y|} \log \pi_{\theta}\left(y_{i} \mid x, y_{<i}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\beta$ is a constant that controls the scaling of the reward difference. We find that normalizing the reward with response lengths is crucial; removing the length normalization term from the reward formulation results in a bias toward generating longer but lower-quality sequences (see Section 4.4 for more details). Consequently, this reward formulation eliminates the need for a reference model, enhancing memory and computational efficiency compared to reference-dependent algorithms.

### 2.3 The SimPO Objective

Target reward margin. Additionally, we introduce a target reward margin term, $\gamma>0$, to the Bradley-Terry objective to ensure that the reward for the winning response, $r\left(x, y_{w}\right)$, exceeds the reward for the losing response, $r\left(x, y_{l}\right)$, by at least $\gamma$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
p\left(y_{w} \succ y_{l} \mid x\right)=\sigma\left(r\left(x, y_{w}\right)-r\left(x, y_{l}\right)-\gamma\right) \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The margin between two classes is known to influence the generalization capabilities of classifiers [1, $9,19,27] .{ }^{2}$ In standard training settings with random model initialization, increasing the target[^1]margin typically improves generalization. In preference optimization, the two classes are the winning and losing responses for a single input. In practice, we observe that generation quality initially improves with an increasing target margin but degrades when the margin becomes too large (\$4.3). One of DPO's variants, IPO [6], also formulates a target reward margin similar to SimPO. However, its full objective is not as effective as SimPO (§4.1).

Objective. Finally, we obtain the SimPO objective by plugging Eq. (4) into Eq. (5):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SimPO}}\left(\pi_{\theta}\right)=-\mathbb{E}_{\left(x, y_{w}, y_{l}\right) \sim \mathcal{D}}\left[\log \sigma\left(\frac{\beta}{\left|y_{w}\right|} \log \pi_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)-\frac{\beta}{\left|y_{l}\right|} \log \pi_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)-\gamma\right)\right] \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

In summary, SimPO employs an implicit reward formulation that directly aligns with the generation metric, eliminating the need for a reference model. Additionally, it introduces a target reward margin $\gamma$ to help separating the winning and losing responses. In Appendix E, we provide a gradient analysis of SimPO and DPO to further understand the differences between the two methods.

## 3 Experimental Setup

Models and training settings. We perform preference optimization with two families of models, Llama3-8B [2] and Mistral-7B [40] under two setups: Base and Instruct.

For the Base setup, we follow the training pipeline of Zephyr [75]. First, we train a base model (i.e., mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1, or meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) on the UltraChat-200k dataset [22] to obtain an SFT model. Then, we perform preference optimization on the UltraFeedback dataset [20] using the SFT model as the starting point. This setup provides a high level of transparency, as the SFT models are trained on open-source data.

For the Instruct setup, we use off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model (i.e., meta-llama/Meta-Llama-38B-Instruct, or mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) as the SFT models. These models have undergone extensive instruction-tuning processes, making them more powerful and robust than the SFT models in the Base setup. However, they are also more opaque because their RLHF procedure is not publicly disclosed. To mitigate the distribution shift between SFT models and the preference optimization process, we generate the preference dataset using the SFT models following [74]. Specifically, we use prompts from the UltraFeedback dataset and regenerate the chosen and rejected response pairs $\left(y_{w}, y_{l}\right)$ with the SFT models. For each prompt $x$, we generate 5 responses using the SFT model with a sampling temperature of 0.8 . We then use PairRM [41] to score the 5 responses, selecting the highest-scoring one as $y_{w}$ and the lowest-scoring one as $y_{l}$. For simplicity, we generate data in a single pass instead of iteratively as in [74].

In summary, we have four setups: Llama3-Base, Llama3-Instruct, Mistral-Base, and Mistral-Instruct. We believe these configurations represent the state-of-the-art, placing our models among the top performers on various leaderboards. We encourage future research to adopt these settings for better and fairer comparisons of different algorithms.

Additionally, we find that tuning hyperparameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance with all the offline preference optimization algorithms, including SimPO. Generally, for SimPO, setting $\beta$ between 2.0 and 2.5 and $\gamma$ between 0.5 and 1.5 leads to good performance across all setups. For more details, please refer to Appendix A.

Evaluation benchmarks. We primarily assess our models using three of the most popular openended instruction-following benchmarks: MT-Bench [88], AlpacaEval 2 [51], ${ }^{3}$ and Arena-Hard v0.1 [50]. These benchmarks evaluate the models' versatile conversational abilities across a diverse set of queries and have been widely adopted by the community (details in Table 2).

AlpacaEval 2 consists of 805 questions from 5 datasets, and MT-Bench covers 8 categories with 80 questions. The most recently released Arena-Hard is an enhanced version of an MT-Bench, incorporating 500 well-defined technical problem-solving queries. We report scores following each benchmark's evaluation protocol. For AlpacaEval 2, we report both the raw win rate (WR) and the length-controlled win rate (LC) [24]. The LC metric is specifically designed to be robust against[^2]

Table 2: Evaluation details for AlpacaEval 2 [51], Arena-Hard [50], and MT-Bench [88]. The baseline model refers to the model compared against. GPT-4 Turbo corresponds to GPT-4-Preview-1106.

| Arena-Hard | 500 | GPT-4-0314 | GPT-4 Turbo | Pairwise comparison | Win rate |
| MT-Bench | 80 | - | GPT-4/GPT-4 Turbo | Single-answer grading | Rating of 1-10 |

model verbosity. For Arena-Hard, we report the win rate (WR) against the baseline model. For MT-Bench, we report the average MT-Bench score with GPT-4 and GPT-4-Preview-1106 as the judge model. ${ }^{4}$ For decoding details, please refer to Appendix A. We also evaluate on downstream tasks from the Huggingface Open Leaderboard benchmarks [8], with additional details in in Appendix B.

Baselines. We compare SimPO with other offline preference optimization methods listed in Table $3 .{ }^{5}$ IPO [6] is a theoretically grounded approach method that avoids DPO's assumption that pairwise preferences can be replaced with pointwise rewards. KTO [25] learns from nonpaired preference data. ORPO [38] introduces a reference-model-free odd ratio term to directly contrast winning and losing responses with the policy model and jointly trains with the SFT objective. R-DPO [60] is a modified version of DPO that includes an additional regularization term to prevent exploitation of length. We thoroughly tune the hyperparameters for each baseline and report best performance. We find that many variants of DPO do not empirically present an advantage over standard DPO. Further details can be found in Appendix A.

## 4 Experimental Results

In this section, we present main results of our experiments, highlighting the superior performance of SimPO on various benchmarks and ablation studies ( $\$ 4.1$ ). We provide an in-depth understanding of the following components: (1) length normalization (§4.2), (2) the margin term $\gamma$ (§4.3), and (3) why SimPO outperforms DPO (\$4.4). Unless otherwise specified, the ablation studies are conducted using the Mistral-Base setting.

### 4.1 Main Results and Ablations

SimPO consistently and significantly outperforms existing preference optimization methods. As shown in Table 4, while all preference optimization algorithms enhance performance over the SFT model, SimPO, despite its simplicity, achieves the best overall performance across all benchmarks and settings. Notably, SimPO outperforms the best baseline by 3.6 to 4.8 points on the AlpacaEval 2 LC win rate and by 0.2 to 6.2 points on Arena-Hard across various settings. These consistent and significant improvements highlight the robustness and effectiveness of SimPO.

Benchmark quality varies. Although all three benchmarks are widely adopted, we find that MTBench exhibits poor separability across different methods. Minor differences between methods on MT-Bench may be attributed to randomness, likely due to the limited scale of its evaluation data[^3]

Table 5: Ablation studies under Mistral-Base and Mistral-Instruct settings. We ablate each key design of SimPO: (1) removing length normalization in Eq. (4) (i.e., w/o LN); (2) setting target reward margin $\gamma$ to be 0 in Eq. (6) (i.e., $\gamma=0$ ).

and its single-instance scoring protocol. This finding aligns with observations reported in [50]. In contrast, AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard provide more meaningful distinctions between different methods. Additionally, Arena-Hard employs a different judge model from the baseline model, likely leading to fairer evaluations. We observe that the win rate on Arena-Hard is significantly lower than on AlpacaEval 2, indicating that Arena-Hard is a more challenging benchmark.

The Instruct setting introduces significant performance gains. Across all benchmarks, we observe that the Instruct setting consistently outperforms the Base setting. This improvement is likely due to the higher quality of SFT models used for initialization and the generation of more high-quality preference data by these models.

Both key designs in SimPO are crucial. In Table 5, we demonstrate results from ablating each key design of SimPO: (1) removing length normalization in Eq. (4) (i.e., w/o LN); (2) setting the target reward margin to be 0 in Eq. (6) (i.e., $\gamma=0$ ). Removing the length normalization has the most negative impact on the results. Our examination reveals that this leads to the generation of long and repetitive patterns, substantially degrading the overall quality of the output (See Appendix D).

optimal target reward margin. In the following subsections, we conduct in-depth analyses to better understand both design choices.

### 4.2 Length Normalization (LN) Prevents Length Exploitation

LN leads to an increase in the reward difference for all preference pairs, regardless of their length. The Bradley-Terry objective in Eq. (5) essentially aims to optimize the reward difference $\Delta r=r\left(x, y_{w}\right)-r\left(x, y_{l}\right)$ to exceed the target margin $\gamma$. We investigate the relationship between the learned reward differences and the length difference $\Delta l=\left|y_{w}\right|-\left|y_{l}\right|$ between the winning and losing responses from the training set of UltraFeedback. We measure the difference of reward ( $r_{\text {SimPO }}$; Eq. (4)) using the SFT model, the SimPO model, and a model trained with SimPO but without length normalization. We present the results in Figure 2a and observe that SimPO with LN consistently achieves a positive reward margin for all response pairs, regardless of their length difference, and consistently improves the margin over the SFT model. In contrast, SimPO without $\mathrm{LN}$ results in a negative reward difference for preference pairs when the winning response is shorter than the losing response, indicating that the model learns poorly for these instances.

Removing $L N$ results in a strong positive correlation between the reward and response length, leading to length exploitation. Figures $2 \mathrm{~b}$ and $2 \mathrm{c}$ illustrate the average log likelihood ( $p_{\theta}$ in Eq. (3)) versus response length on a held-out set for models trained with SimPO and SimPO without LN. The model trained without LN exhibits a much stronger positive Spearman correlation between likelihood and response length compared to SimPO, indicating a tendency to exploit length bias and generate longer sequences (see Appendix D). In contrast, SimPO results in a Spearman correlation coefficient similar to the SFT model (see Figure 5a).

### 4.3 The Impact of Target Reward Margin in SimPO

Influence of $\gamma$ on reward accuracy and win rate. We investigate how the target reward margin $\gamma$ in SimPO affects the reward accuracy on a held-out set and win rate on AlpacaEval 2, presenting the results in Figure 3a. Reward accuracy is measured as the percentage of preference pairs where the winning response ends up having a higher reward for the wining response than the losing response (i.e., $r\left(x, y_{w}\right)>r\left(x, y_{l}\right)$ ). We observe that reward accuracy increases with $\gamma$ on both benchmarks, indicating that enforcing a larger target reward margin effectively improves reward accuracy. However,

the win rate on AlpacaEval 2 first increases and then decreases with $\gamma$, suggesting that generation quality is not solely determined by the reward margin.

Impact of $\gamma$ on the reward distribution. We visualize the distribution of the learned reward margin $r\left(x, y_{w}\right)-r\left(x, y_{l}\right)$ and the reward of winning responses $r\left(x, y_{w}\right)$ under varying $\gamma$ values in Figure $2 \mathrm{~b}$ and Figure 2c. Notably, increasing $\gamma$ tends to flatten both distributions and reduce the average log likelihood of winning sequences. This initially improves performance but can eventually lead to model degeneration. We hypothesize that there is a trade-off between accurately approximating the true reward distribution and maintaining a well-calibrated likelihood when setting the $\gamma$ value. Further exploration of this balance is deferred to future work.

### 4.4 In-Depth Analysis of DPO vs. SimPO

In this section, we compare SimPO to DPO in terms of (1) likelihood-length correlation, (2) reward formulation, (3) reward accuracy, and (4) algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate that SimPO outperforms DPO in terms of reward accuracy and efficiency.

DPO reward implicitly facilitates length normalization. Although the DPO reward expression $r(x, y)=$ $\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y \mid x)}{\pi_{\text {ref }}(y \mid x)}$ (with the partition function excluded), lacks an explicit term for length normalization, the logarithmic ratio between the policy model and the reference model can serve to implicitly counteract length bias. As shown in Table 6 and Figure 4a, employing DPO reduces the Spearman correlation coefficient between average log likelihood and response length compared to the approach without any length normalization (referred to as "SimPO w/o LN"). However, it still exhibits a stronger positive correlation when compared to SimPO. ${ }^{6}$

DPO reward mismatches generation likelihood. There is a divergence between DPO's reward formulation, $r_{\theta}(x, y)=\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y \mid x)}{\pi_{\text {ref }}(y \mid x)}$, and the average log likelihood metric, $p_{\theta}(y \mid x)=\frac{1}{|y|} \log \pi_{\theta}(y \mid$ $x$ ), which directly impacts generation. As shown in Figure 4b, among the instances on the UltraFeedback training set where $r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{w}\right)>r_{\theta}\left(x, y_{l}\right)$, almost half of the pairs have $p_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)<p_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)$. In contrast, SimPO directly employs the average $\log$ likelihood (scaled by $\beta$ ) as the reward expression, thereby eliminating the discrepancy completely, as demonstrated in Figure 5b.

DPO lags behind SimPO in terms of reward accuracy. In Figure $4 c$, we compare the reward accuracy of SimPO and DPO, assessing how well their final learned rewards align with preference labels on a held-out set. We observe that SimPO consistently achieves higher reward accuracy than DPO, suggesting that our reward design facilitates more effective generalization and leads to higher quality generations.

SimPO is more memory and compute-efficient than DPO. Another benefit of SimPO is its efficiency as it does not use a reference model. Figure 4d illustrates the overall run time and per-GPU[^4]peak memory usage of SimPO and DPO in the Llama3-Base setting using $8 \times \mathrm{H} 100$ GPUs. Compared to a vanilla DPO implementation, ${ }^{7}$ SimPO cuts run time by roughly $20 \%$ and reduces GPU memory usage by about $10 \%$, thanks to eliminating forward passes with the reference model.

## 5 Related Work

Reinforcemant learning from human feedback. RLHF is a technique that aligns large language models with human preferences and values $[15,91,58,7]$. The classical RLHF pipeline typically comprises three phases: supervised fine-tuning $[90,72,29,18,44,22,77,13,79]$, reward model training [28, 56, 14, 52, 33, 46], and policy optimization [66, 4]. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [66] is a widely used algorithm in the third stage of RLHF. The RLHF framework is also widely applied to various applications, such as mitigating toxicity [45, 3], ensuring safety [21], enhancing helpfulness [73], serching and navigating the web [57], and improving model reasoning abilities [32]. Recently, [12] has highlighted challenges across the whole RLHF pipeline from preference data collection to model training. Further research has also demonstrated that RLHF can lead to biased outcomes, such as verbose outputs from the model $[24,67,78]$.

Preference optimization. Given that online preference optimization algorithms are complex and difficult to optimize $[89,65]$, researchers have been exploring more efficient and simpler alternative offline algorithms. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [62] is a notable example. However, the absence of a reward model in DPO limits its ability to sample preference pairs from the optimal policy. To address this, researchers have explored augmenting preference data using a trained SFT policy [87] or a refined SFT policy with rejection sampling [55], enabling the policy to learn from data generated by the optimal policy. Further studies have extended this approach to an iterative training setup, continuously updating the reference model for optimization with either the most recent policy model or by generating preference pairs scored and selected by the evolving policy model [42, 63, 84]. Additionally, some studies have replaced the online RL objective with offline ranking objectives, allowing for comparisons among more than two instances from a broader perspective $[23,54,68,83]$. Another line of work explores simpler preference optimization objectives without relying on a reference model $[38,81]$, similar to SimPO. Our work follows the pair-wise preference optimization setup without iterative training. We compare it to a series of offline algorithms, including DPO, IPO [6], KTO [25], ORPO [38], and R-DPO [60], and find that SimPO can outperform these methods in both efficiency and performance. Recently, [71] proposed a generalized preference optimization framework that unifies different offline algorithms, and SimPO can be seen as a special case of this framework.

## 6 Discussion

Conclusion. In this work, we propose SimPO, a simple and effective preference optimization algorithm that consistently outperforms existing approaches across various training setups. By aligning the reward function with the generation likelihood and introducing a target reward margin, SimPO eliminates the need for a reference model and achieves strong performance without exploiting the length bias. Extensive analysis demonstrates that the key designs in SimPO are crucial and validates the efficiency and effectiveness of SimPO.

Limitations and future work. First, despite the empirical success and intuitive motivation of SimPO, we lack a theoretical and rigorous understanding of why it works. Moreover, the introduction of a target reward margin requires us to tune an additional hyperparameter, future work could explore how to determine the optimal margin automatically. Second, SimPO is an offline preference algorithm and does not leverage iterative training or other orthogonal techniques. Future work could explore the integration of SimPO with these methods to further enhance model performance. Third, our experiments focus solely on the evaluation of helpfulness, neglecting other crucial aspects of model behavior such as safety, honesty, and fairness. Investigating the generalization of SimPO to these behaviors in future studies is important. Finally, we observe a performance drop on some downstream tasks, especially on the math benchmarks. We provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations and future directions in the next section.[^5]

## Limitations

- More in-depth theoretical analysis. Despite the empirical success and intuitive motivation of SimPO, a more rigorous theoretical analysis is necessary to fully understand the factors contributing to its effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce an additional hyperparameter, the target reward margin, which requires manual tuning. Future work could explore how to determine the optimal margin automatically and provide a more theoretical understanding of SimPO.
- Safety and honesty. SimPO is designed to optimize the generation quality of language models by pushing the margin between the average log likelihood of the winning response and the losing response to exceed a target reward margin. However, it does not explicitly consider safety and honesty aspects, which are crucial for real-world applications. Future work should explore integrating safety and honesty constraints into SimPO to ensure that the generated responses are not only high-quality but also safe and honest. The dataset used in this work, UltraFeedback [20], primarily focuses on helpfulness, and future research may consider a more comprehensive study utilizing larger-scale preference datasets [39, 86] and evaluation benchmarks [76] that place a strong emphasis on safety aspects. Nonetheless, we observe that this method consistently achieves high TruthfulQA [53] performance compared to other objectives in Table 9, suggesting its potential for safety alignment.
- Performance drop on math. We observed that preference optimization algorithms generally decrease downstream task performance, particularly on reasoning-heavy tasks like GSM8k, as shown in Table 9. SimPO occasionally results in performance comparable to or worse than DPO. We hypothesize that this may be related to the choice of training datasets, hyperparameters used for training, or a mismatch of chat templates used for downstream task evaluations. One explanation is that the preference optimization objective may not be effectively increasing the likelihood of preferred sequences despite increasing the reward margin. [59] first observed this phenomenon and point out that this can hinder learning from math preference pairs where changing one token can flip the label (e.g., changing $2+2=4$ to $2+2=5$ ). They propose a simple regularization strategy to add back a reference-model calibrated supervised fine-tuning loss to the preference optimization objective, and effectively mitigate this issue. Future work may consider integrating this regularization strategy into SimPO to improve performance on reasoning-heavy tasks.
