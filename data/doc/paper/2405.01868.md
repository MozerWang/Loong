#### Abstract

This paper aims to efficiently enable large language models (LLMs) to use external knowledge and goal guidance in conversational recommender system (CRS) tasks. Advanced LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are limited in domain-specific CRS tasks for 1) generating grounded responses with recommendationoriented knowledge, or 2) proactively leading the conversations through different dialogue goals. In this work, we first analyze those limitations through a comprehensive evaluation, showing the necessity of external knowledge and goal guidance which contribute significantly to the recommendation accuracy and language quality. In light of this finding, we propose a novel ChatCRS framework to decompose the complex CRS task into several subtasks through the implementation of 1 ) a knowledge retrieval agent using a tool-augmented approach to reason over external Knowledge Bases and 2) a goal-planning agent for dialogue goal prediction. Experimental results on two multi-goal CRS datasets reveal that ChatCRS sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks, improving language quality of informativeness by $17 \%$ and proactivity by $27 \%$, and achieving a tenfold enhancement in recommendation accuracy ${ }^{1}$.


## 1 Introduction

Conversational recommender system (CRS) integrates conversational and recommendation system (RS) technologies, naturally planning and proactively leading the conversations from nonrecommendation goals (e.g., "chitchat" or "question answering") to recommendation-related goals (e.g., "movie recommendation; Jannach et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b). Compared with traditional RS, CRS highlights the multi-round interactions between users and systems using natural language. Besides the recommendation task evaluated by the recommendation accuracy as in RS, CRS also[^0]

Figure 1: An example of CRS tasks with external knowledge and goal guidance. (Blue: CRS tasks; Red: External Knowledge and Goal Guidance)

focuses on multi-round interactions in response generation tasks including asking questions, responding to user utterances or balancing recommendation versus conversation (Li et al., 2023).

Large language models (LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT) that are significantly more proficient in response generation show great potential in CRS applications. However, current research concentrates on evaluating only their recommendation capability (Sanner et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023). Even though LLMs demonstrate a competitive zero-shot recommendation proficiency, their recommendation performance primarily depends on content-based information (internal knowledge) and exhibits sensitivity towards demographic data (He et al., 2023; Sanner et al., 2023). Specifically, LLMs excel in domains with ample internal knowledge (e.g., English movies). However, in domains with scarce internal knowledge (e.g., Chinese movies ${ }^{2}$ ), we found through our empirical analysis (ยง 3) that their recommendation performance notably dimin-[^1]ishes. Such limitation of LLM-based CRS motivates exploring solutions from prior CRS research to enhance domain coverage and task performance.

Prior work on CRS has employed general language models (LMs; e.g., DialoGPT) as the base architecture, but bridged the gap to domain-specific CRS tasks by incorporating external knowledge and goal guidance (Wang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b). Inspired by this approach, we conduct an empirical analysis on the DuRecDial dataset (Liu et al., 2021) to understand how external inputs ${ }^{3}$ can efficiently adapt LLMs in the experimented domain and enhance their performance on both recommendation and response generation tasks.

Our analysis results (ยง 3) reveal that despite their strong language abilities, LLMs exhibit notable limitations when directly applied to CRS tasks without external inputs in the Chinese movie domain. For example, lacking domain-specific knowledge ("Jimmy's Award") hinders the generation of pertinent responses, while the absence of explicit goals ("recommendation") leads to unproductive conversational turns (Figure 1). Identifying and mitigating such constraints is crucial for developing effective LLM-based CRS (Li et al., 2023).

Motivated by the empirical evidence that external inputs can significantly boost LLM performance on both CRS tasks, we propose a novel ChatCRS framework. It decomposes the overall CRS problem into sub-components handled by specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and goal planning, all managed by a core LLM-based conversational agent. This design enhances the framework's flexibility, allowing it to work with different LLM models without additional fine-tuning while capturing the benefits of external inputs (Figure 2b). Our contributions can be summarised as:

- We present the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on both CRS tasks, including response generation and recommendation, and underscore the challenges in LLM-based CRS.
- We propose the ChatCRS framework as the first knowledge-grounded and goal-directed LLMbased CRS using LLMs as conversational agents.
- Experimental findings validate the efficacy and efficiency of ChatCRS in both CRS tasks. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates how external inputs contribute to LLM-based CRS.[^2]


## 2 Related Work

Attribute-based/Conversational approaches in CRS. Existing research in CRS has been categorized into two approaches (Gao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023): 1) attribute-based approaches, where the system and users exchange item attributes without conversation (Zhang et al., 2018; Lei et al., 2020), and 2) conversational approaches, where the system interacts users through natural language $(\mathrm{Li}$ et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a).

LLM-based CRS. LLMs have shown promise in CRS applications as 1) zero-shot conversational recommenders with item-based (Palma et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023) or conversational inputs (He et al., 2023; Sanner et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b); 2) AI agents controlling pre-trained CRS or LMs for CRS tasks (Feng et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023); and 3) user simulators evaluating interactive CRS systems (Wang et al., 2023c; Zhang and Balog, 2020; Huang et al., 2024). However, there is a lack of prior work integrating external inputs to improve LLM-based CRS models.

Multi-agent and tool-augmented LLMs. LLMs, as conversational agents, can actively pursue specific goals through multi-agent task decomposition and tool augmentation (Wang et al., 2023d). This involves delegating subtasks to specialized agents and invoking external tools like knowledge retrieval, enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities and knowledge coverage (Yao et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023).

In our work, we focus on the conversational approach, jointly evaluating CRS on both recommendation and response generation tasks (Wang et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023). Unlike existing methods, ChatCRS uniquely combines goal planning and tool-augmented knowledge retrieval agents within a unified framework. This leverages LLMs' innate language and reasoning capabilities without requiring extensive fine-tuning.

## 3 Preliminary: Empirical Analysis

We consider the CRS scenario where a system system interacts with a user $u$. Each dialogue contains $T$ conversation turns with user and system utterances, denoted as $C=\left\{s_{j}^{\text {system }}, s_{j}^{u}\right\}_{j=1}^{T}$. The target function for CRS is expressed in two parts: given the dialogue history $C_{j}$ of the past $j^{\text {th }}$ turns, it generates 1) the recommendation of item $i$ and 2) the next system response $s_{j+1}^{\text {system }}$. In

some methods, knowledge $K$ is given as an external input to facilitate both the recommendation and response generation tasks while dialogue goals $G$ only facilitate the response generation task due to the fixed "recommendation" goals in the recommendation task. Given the user's contextual history $C_{j}$, system generates recommendation results $i$ and system response $s_{j+1}^{\text {system }}$ in Eq. 1 .

$$
\begin{equation*}
y^{*}=\prod_{j=1}^{T} P_{\theta}\left(i, s_{j+1}^{\text {system }} \mid C_{j}, K, G\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.1 Empirical Analysis Approaches

Building on the advancements of LLMs over general LMs in language generation and reasoning, we explore their inherent response generation and recommendation capabilities, with and without external knowledge or goal guidance. Our analysis comprises three settings, as shown in Figure 2a:

- Direct Generation (DG). LLMs directly generate system responses and recommendations without any external inputs (Figure 5a).
- Chain-of-thought Generation (COT). LLMs internally reason their built-in knowledge and goalplanning scheme for both CRS tasks (Figure 5b).
- Oracular Generation (Oracle). LLMs leverage gold-standard external knowledge and dialogue goals to enhance performance in both CRS tasks, providing an upper bound (Figure 5c).

Additionally, we conduct an ablation study of different knowledge types on both CRS tasks by analyzing 1) factual knowledge, referring to general facts about entities and expressed as single triple (e.g., [Jiong-Star sign-Taurus]), and 2) item-based knowledge, related to recommended items and expressed as multiple triples (e.g., [Cecilia-Star in$<$ movie 1 , movie $2, \ldots$, movie $n>$ ]).

Figure 5 provides an overview of the ICL prompts, with examples detailed in Appendix A. 1 and experiments detailed in $\S 5$. For response generation, we evaluate content preservation (bleu-n, $F 1$ ) and diversity (dist- $n$ ) with knowledge and goal prediction accuracy. For recommendation, we evaluate top-K ranking accuracy ( $N D C G @ k, M R R @ k$ ).

### 3.2 Empirical Analysis Findings

We summarize our three main findings given the results of the response generation and recommendation tasks shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Finding 1: The Necessity of External Inputs in LLM-based CRS. Integrating external inputs significantly enhances performance across all LLM-based CRS tasks (Oracle), underscoring the insufficiency of LLMs alone as effective CRS tools and highlighting the indispensable role of external inputs. Remarkably, the Oracle approach yields over a tenfold improvement in recommendation tasks with only external knowledge compared to DG and COT methods, as the dialogue goal is fixed as "recom-

mendation" (Table 1). Although utilizing internal knowledge and goal guidance (COT) marginally benefits both tasks, we see in Table 2 for the response generation task that the low accuracy of internal predictions adversely affects performance.

Finding 2: Improved Internal Knowledge or Goal Planning Capability in Advanced LLMs. Table 2 reveals that the performance of Chain-of-Thought (COT) by a larger LLM (LLaMA-13b) is comparable to oracular performance of a smaller LLM (LLaMA-7b). This suggests that the intrinsic knowledge and goal-setting capabilities of more sophisticated LLMs can match or exceed the benefits derived from external inputs used by their less advanced counterparts. Nonetheless, such internal knowledge or goal planning schemes are still insufficient for CRS in domain-specific tasks while the integration of more accurate knowledge and goal guidance (Oracle) continues to enhance performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) outcomes.

Finding 3: Both factual and item-based knowledge jointly improve LLM performance on domainspecific CRS tasks. As shown in Table 3, integrating both factual and item-based knowledge yields performance gains for LLMs on both response generation and recommendation tasks. Our analysis suggests that even though a certain type of knowledge may not directly benefit a CRS task (e.g., factual knowledge may not contain the target items for the recommendation task), it can still benefit LLMs

by associating unknown entities with their internal knowledge, thereby adapting the universally pre-trained LLMs to task-specific domains more effectively. Consequently, we leverage both types of knowledge jointly in our ChatCRS framework.

## 4 ChatCRS

Our ChatCRS modelling framework has three components: 1) a knowledge retrieval agent, 2) a goal planning agent and 3) an LLM-based conversational agent (Figure 2b). Given a complex CRS task, an LLM-based conversational agent first decomposes it into subtasks managed by knowledge retrieval or goal-planning agents. The retrieved knowledge or predicted goal from each agent is incorporated into the ICL prompt to instruct LLMs to generate CRS responses or recommendations.

### 4.1 Knowledge Retrieval agent

Our analysis reveals that integrating both factual and item-based knowledge can significantly boost the performance of LLM-based CRS. However, knowledge-enhanced approaches for LLM-based CRS present unique challenges that have been relatively unexplored compared to prior training-based methods in CRS or retrieval-augmented (RA) methods in NLP (Zhang, 2023; Di Palma, 2023).

Training-based methods, which train LMs to memorize or interpret knowledge representations through techniques like graph propagation, have been widely adopted in prior CRS research (Wei et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). However, such approaches are computationally infeasible for LLMs due to their input length constraints and training costs. RA methods, which first collect evidence and then generate responses, face two key limitations in CRS (Manzoor and Jannach, 2021; Gao et al., 2023). First, without a clear query formulation in CRS, RA methods can only approximate results rather than retrieve the exact relevant knowledge (Zhao et al., 2024; Barnett et al., 2024). Especially when multiple similar entries exist in the knowledge base (KB), precisely locating the accurate knowledge for CRS becomes challenging. Second, RA methods retrieve knowledge relevant only to the current dialogue turn, whereas CRS requires planning for potential knowledge needs in future turns, differing from knowledge-based QA systems (Mao et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023). For instance, when discussing a celebrity without a clear query (e.g., "I love Cecilia..."), the system should anticipate retrieving relevant factual knowledge (e.g., "birth date" or "star sign") or item-based knowledge (e.g., "acting movies") for subsequent response generation or recommendations, based on the user's likely interests.

To address this challenge, we employ a relationbased method which allows LLMs to flexibly plan and quickly retrieve relevant "entity-relationentity" knowledge triples $K$ by traversing along the relations $R$ of mentioned entities $E$ (Moon et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2023). Firstly, entities for each utterance is directly provided by extracting entities in the knowledge bases from the dialogue utterance (Zou et al., 2022). Relations that are adjacent to entity $E$ from the $\mathrm{KB}$ are then extracted as candidate relations (denoted as $F 1$ ) and LLMs are instructed to plan the knowledge retrieval by selecting the most pertinent relation $R^{*}$ given the

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_716205946e78faeb4304g-05.jpg?height=391&width=761&top_left_y=247&top_left_x=1067)

Figure 3: Knowledge retrieval agent in ChatCRS.

dialogue history $C_{j}$. Knowledge triples $K^{*}$ can finally be acquired using entity $E$ and predicted relation $R^{*}$ (denoted as $F 2$ ). The process is formulated in Figure 3 and demonstrated with an example in Figure 7. Given the dialogue utterance "I love Cecilia..." and the extracted entity [Cecilia], the system first extracts all potential relations for [Cecilia], from which the LLM selects the most relevant relation, [Star in]. The knowledge retrieval agent then fetches the complete knowledge triple [Cecilia-Star in-<movie 1, movie 2, ..., movie $n>$ ].

When there are multiple entities in one utterance, we perform the knowledge retrieval one by one and in the scenario where there are multiple itembased knowledge triples, we randomly selected a maximum of 50 item-based knowledge due to the limitations of input token length. We implement $\mathrm{N}$-shot ICL to guide LLMs in choosing knowledge relations and we show the detailed ICL prompt and instruction with examples in Table 10 (ยง A.2).

### 4.2 Goal Planning agent

Accurately predicting the dialogue goals is crucial for 1) proactive response generation and 2) balancing recommendations versus conversations in CRS. Utilizing goal annotations for each dialogue utterance from CRS datasets, we leverage an existing language model, adjusting it for goal generation by incorporating a Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) approach (Hu et al., 2021; Dettmers et al., 2023). This method enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning by adjusting only the rank-decomposition matrices. For each dialogue history $C_{j}^{k}$ ( $j$-th turn in dialogue $k ; j \in T, k \in N$ ), the LoRA model is trained to generate the dialogue goal $G^{*}$ for the next utterance using the prompt of dialogue history, optimizing the loss function in $\mathrm{Eq} 2$ with $\theta$ representing the trainable parameters of LoRA. The detailed prompt and instructions are shown in Table 11 (ยง A.3).

$$
\begin{equation*}
L_{g}=-\sum_{k}^{N} \sum_{j}^{T} \log P_{\theta}\left(G^{*} \mid C_{j}^{k}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}

### 4.3 LLM-based Conversational Agent

In ChatCRS, the knowledge retrieval and goalplanning agents serve as essential tools for CRS tasks, while LLMs function as tool-augmented conversational agents that utilize these tools to accomplish primary CRS objectives. Upon receiving a new dialogue history $C_{j}$, the LLM-based conversational agent employs these tools to determine the dialogue goal $G^{*}$ and relevant knowledge $K^{*}$, which then instruct the generation of either a system response $s_{j+1}^{\text {system }}$ or an item recommendation $i$ through prompting scheme, as formulated in Eq 3. The detailed ICL prompt can be found in $\S$ A.1.

$$
\begin{equation*}

## 5 Experiments

### 5.1 Experimental Setups

Datasets. We conduct the experiments on two multi-goal Chinese CRS benchmark datasets a) DuRecDial (Liu et al., 2021) in English and Chinese, and b) TG-ReDial (Zhou et al., 2020) in Chinese (statistics in Table 12). Both datasets are annotated for goal guidance, while only DuRecDial contains knowledge annotation and an external KBCNpedia (Zhou et al., 2022) is used for TG-Redial. Baselines. We compare our model with ChatGPT ${ }^{4}$ and LLaMA-7b/13b (Touvron et al., 2023) in few- shot settings. We also compare fully-trained UniMIND (Deng et al., 2023), MGCG-G(Liu et al., 2023b), TPNet(Wang et al., 2023a), MGCG (Liu et al., 2020) and SASRec (Kang and McAuley, 2018), which are previous SOTA CRS and RS models and we summarise each baseline in $\S ~ A .6$.

Automatic Evaluation. For response generation evaluation, we adopt $B L E U, F 1$ for content preservation and Dist for language diversity. For recommendation evaluation, we adopt $N D C G @ k$ and $M R R @ K$ to evaluate top $\mathrm{K}$ ranking accuracy. For the knowledge retrieval agent, we adopt Accuracy $(A c c)$, Precision $(P)$, Recall $(R)$ and $F 1$ to evaluate the accuracy of relation selection (ยง A.2). Human Evaluation. For human evaluation, we randomly sample 100 dialogues from DuRecDial, comparing the responses produced by UniMIND, ChatGPT, LLaMA-13b and ChatCRS. Three annotators are asked to score each generated response with $\{0$ : poor, 1: ok, 2 : good $\}$ in terms of a) general language quality in (Flu)ency and (Coh)erence, and b) CRS-specific language qualities of (Info)rmativeness and (Pro)activity. Details of the process and criterion are discussed in $\S$ A.4. Implementation Details. For both the CRS tasks in Empirical Analysis, we adopt N-shot ICL prompt settings on ChatGPT and LLaMA* (Dong et al., 2022), where $N$ examples from the training data are added to the ICL prompt. In modelling framework, for the goal planning agent, we adopt[^3]

QLora as a parameter-efficient way to fine-tune LLaMA-7b (Dettmers et al., 2023). For the knowledge retrieval agent and LLM-based conversational agent, we adopt the same $\mathrm{N}$-shot ICL approach on ChatGPT and LLaMA* (Jiang et al., 2023). Detailed experimental setups are discussed in ยง A.6.

### 5.2 Experimental Results

ChatCRS significantly improves LLM-based conversational systems for CRS tasks, outperforming SOTA baselines in response generation in both datasets, enhancing content preservation and language diversity (Table 4). ChatCRS sets new SOTA benchmarks on both datasets using 3-shot ICL prompts incorporating external inputs. In recommendation tasks (Table 5), LLM-based approaches lag behind full-data trained baselines due to insufficient in-domain knowledge. Remarkably, ChatCRS, by harnessing external knowledge, achieves a tenfold increase in recommendation accuracy over existing LLM baselines on both datasets with ICL, without full-data fine-tuning.

Human evaluation highlights ChatCRS's enhancement in CRS-specific language quality. Table 6 shows the human evaluation and ablation results. ChatCRS outperforms baseline models in both general and CRS-specific language qualities. While all LLM-based approaches uniformly exceed the general LM baseline (UniMIND) in general

language quality, ChatCRS notably enhances coherence through its goal guidance feature, enabling response generation more aligned with the dialogue goal. Significant enhancements in CRS-specific language quality, particularly in informativeness and proactivity, underscore the value of integrating external knowledge and goals. Ablation studies, removing either knowledge retrieval or goal planning agent, demonstrate a decline in scores for informativeness and proactivity respectively, confirming the efficacy of both external inputs for CRS-specific language quality.

### 5.3 Detailed Discussion

CRS datasets typically contain a huge volume of knowledge. By analyzing dialogues from the DuRecDial datasets, categorized by goal types, we calculated a "Knowledge Ratio" dividing the number of utterances with annotated knowledge $N_{K, G}$ by total number of utterances $N_{G}$ in each goal type (Eq 4) to measure the necessity of relevant knowledge in CRS task completion. Our analysis, depicted in Figure 4, shows that recommendation tasks rank highly in terms of knowledge necessity, with "POI recommendation" dialogues requiring pertinent knowledge in $75 \%$ of cases.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Knowledge Ratio }(\mathrm{KR})_{G}=\frac{N_{K, G}}{N_{G}} \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Internal knowledge of LLMs is insufficient for handling domain-specific CRS tasks, which is reaffirmed by the analysis of knowledge retrieval accuracy in Table 7. Contrasting with traditional RS which relies on user data for collaborative recommendations, CRS mainly depends on context/content-based recommendation (He et al., 2023). This shift highlights the limitations of

| Case Study 1: Factual Knowledge QA | Case Study 2: Proactive Response Generation |
| :---: | :---: |
| Dialogue history (Dial_ID 39-1): <br> : Do you know Jiong He's zodiac <br> sign? | Dialogue history (Dial_ID 89-14): <br> : I like Cecilia Cheung very much. Her acting is very good. <br> [. <br> : Yeah, have you seen Cecilia Cheung's One Night in Mongkok? <br> : I've seen it. I don't want to see it again. |
| System Responses: <br> $[\mathcal{J}]$ UniMIND: Of course, Taurus <br> $[ะฅ]$ ChatGPT: Jiong He's zodiac sign <br> is Cancer. <br> $[\times]$ LLaMA: Jiong He's zodiac sign is <br> Aries. <br> $[\checkmark]$ ChatCRS: Yes, I do! Jiong He's <br> zodiac sign is Taurus. <br> [Retrieved Knowledge: <br> ('Jiong He', 'zodiac sign ', 'Taurus')] | System Responses: <br> $[\mathcal{\checkmark}]$ UniMIND: How about <Left Right...Destiny>, a very touching movie. <br> $[\checkmark]$ ChatGPT: How about trying her other film, <Lost in Time>, a touching <br> romance that showcases her acting skills? <br> $[\times]$ LLaMA: Maybe you can try it again, you may find a different feeling. <br> $[\mathcal{J}$ ChatCRS: If you haven't seen it, you should watch <Left <br> Right...Destiny>, it's Cecilia Cheung's new movie this year. She played the <br> role of a taxi driver, very cool! Have you seen it? <br> $[$ Predicted Goal: Movie Recommendation] |

LLMs in harnessing internal knowledge. ChatCRS overcomes these limitations by interfacing LLMs to plan and reason over external KBs through entities and relations. Therefore, it largely improves the recommendation accuracy, outperforming the training-based approach using full data. Given the limitations in LLM-based CRS tasks, (Zhang, 2023; Di Palma, 2023), we anticipate future studies to further explore such approaches in CRS.

Factual knowledge guides the response generation process, mitigating the risks of generating implausible or inconsistent responses. The "Asking questions" goal type which has the highest knowledge ratio, demonstrates the advantage of leveraging external knowledge in answering factual questions like "the zodiac sign of an Asian celebrity" (Table 8). Standard LLMs produce responses with fabricated content, but ChatCRS accurately retrieves and integrates external knowledge, ensuring factual and informative responses.

Goal guidance contributes more to the linguistic quality of CRS by managing the dialogue flow. We examine the goal planning proficiency of ChatCRS by showcasing the results of goal predictions of the top 5 goal types in each dataset (Figure 6). DuRecDial dataset shows better balances among recommendation and non-recommendation goals, which exactly aligns with the real-world scenarios (Hayati et al., 2020). However, the TG-Redial dataset contains more recommendationrelated goals and multi-goal utterances, making the goal predictions more challenging. The detailed goal planning accuracy is discussed in $\S ~ A .5$.

Dialogue goals guide LLMs towards a proactive conversational recommender. For a clearer understanding, we present a scenario in Table 8 where a CRS seamlessly transitions between "asking questions" and "movie recommendation", illustrating how accurate goal direction boosts interaction relevance and efficacy. Specifically, if a recommendation does not succeed, ChatCRS will adeptly pose further questions to refine subsequent recommendation responses while LLMs may keep outputting wrong recommendations, creating unproductive dialogue turns. This further emphasizes the challenges of conversational approaches in CRS, where the system needs to proactively lead the dialogue from non-recommendation goals to approach the users' interests for certain items or responses (Liu et al., 2023b), and underscores the goal guidance in fostering proactive engagement in CRS.

## 6 Conclusion

This paper conducts an empirical investigation into the LLM-based CRS for domain-specific applications in the Chinese movie domain, emphasizing the insufficiency of LLMs in domain-specific CRS tasks and the necessity of integrating external knowledge and goal guidance. We introduce ChatCRS, a novel framework that employs a unified agent-based approach to more effectively incorporate these external inputs. Our experimental findings highlight improvements over existing benchmarks, corroborated by both automatic and human evaluation. ChatCRS marks a pivotal advancement in CRS research, fostering a paradigm where complex problems are decomposed into subtasks managed by agents, which maximizes the inherent capabilities of LLMs and their domainspecific adaptability in CRS applications.

## Limitations

This research explores the application of few-shot learning and parameter-efficient techniques with large language models (LLMs) for generating responses and making recommendations, circumventing the need for the extensive fine-tuning these models usually require. Due to budget and computational constraints, our study is limited to incontext learning with economically viable, smallerscale closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT, and opensource models such as LLaMA-7b and -13b.

A significant challenge encountered in this study is the scarcity of datasets with adequate annotations for knowledge and goal-oriented guidance for each dialogue turn. This limitation hampers the development of conversational models capable of effectively understanding and navigating dialogue. It is anticipated that future datasets will overcome this shortfall by providing detailed annotations, thereby greatly improving conversational models' ability to comprehend and steer conversations.

## Ethic Concerns

The ethical considerations for our study involving human evaluation (ยง 5.1) have been addressed through the attainment of an IRB Exemption for the evaluation components involving human subjects. The datasets utilized in our research are accessible to the public (Liu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020), and the methodology employed for annotation adheres to a double-blind procedure (ยง 5.1). Additionally, annotators receive compensation at a rate of $\$ 15$ per hour, which is reflective of the actual hours worked.
