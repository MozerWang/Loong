Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K for scaled disclosures for smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 1, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Focus and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Perfecular, AVX, Focus Shenzhen, Lusher and AT Tech Systems (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Segment Reporting

 

The Company currently has two operating segments. In accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), the Company considers operating segments to be components of the Company’s business for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by Management in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. Management reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has three operating and reportable segments. The Company consists of three types of operations. (1) Focus and Focus Shenzhen collectively operate our “Corporate and R&D” segment, which involves the non-specific financing, executive expense, operations and investor relations of our public entity, and the general shared management and costs across the Company’s subsidiaries that spread across all functional categories and research and development of technology products. (2) Perfecular, AVX (doing business as and branded under Smart AVX) and Lusher jointly operate the “IoT Products” segment, which involves the wholesale, marketing, and production of our universal smart instruments and devices in the hydroponic and controlled agriculture segments and of our smart products into the commercial and home automation sectors. (3) AVX (exclusive of the smart IoT Products sales under Smart AVX) and AT Tech Systems cooperatively run our “IoT Installation Services” segment, which handles our IoT installation and management business specializing in high performance and easy to use audio/video systems, home theaters, lighting control, automation, and integration.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.

 

The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the lease term impacting right-of use asset and lease liability, useful lives of property and equipment, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The Company regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions.

 

 

 

                                                                   9                                                                    

 

 

Allowance for doubtful accounts

 

The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends and review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to $249,603 and $249,603, respectively.

  

Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.

 

Major customers

 

Three customers accounted for 69% of the total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and four customers accounted for 59% of the total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023. One customer accounted for 31% of the total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024 and one customer accounted for 43% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023.

 

Major vendors

 

No major vendor accounted more than 10% of total purchase during three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Share-based Compensation

  

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in conformity with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation to employees consist of stock options, grants, and restricted shares that are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant.

 

The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and is recognized as an expense over the period during which services are received.

 

The Company calculates the fair value of option grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimates the fair value of the stock based upon the estimated fair value of the common stock. The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.

 

 

 

                                                                   10                                                                   

 

 

The resulting stock-based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company follows paragraph ASC 825-10-50-10 for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph ASC 820-10-35-37 (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

 

To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 

     ·    Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

           

     ·    Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or

           indirectly observable as of the reporting

           date.

           

     ·    Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

 

The following table summarize financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

 

Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. The Company’s other comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Revenue from the Company is recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its services and products to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:

 

     ·    executed contracts with the Company’s customers that it believes are legally enforceable;

           

     ·    identification of performance obligations in the respective contract;

           

     ·    determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;

           

     ·    Allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and

           

     ·    recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

 

These five elements, as applied to each of the Company’s revenue category, is summarized below:

 

     ·    Product sales – revenue is recognized at the time of sale upon the delivery of the equipment to the customer and completion

           of performance

           obligation.

           

     ·    Service sales – revenue is recognized based on the service been provided and the agreed upon performance obligation has been

           completed to the

           customer.

 

Revenue from our project construction is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method under the cost approach. The percentage of completion is determined by estimating stage of work completed. Under this approach, recognized contract revenue equals the total estimated contract revenue multiplied by the percentage of completion. Our construction contracts are unit priced, and an account receivable is recorded for amounts invoiced based on actual units produced.

 

A summary of our revenue by product type for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Research and development

 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to refine existing product models and develop new product models.

 

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share

 

Net income (loss) per share is computed pursuant to ASC 260-10-45. Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

 

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of stock and potentially outstanding shares of stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.

 

Due to the net loss incurred by the Company, potentially dilutive instruments would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss for all periods presented. The following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

 

The reporting and functional currency of Focus is the USD. The functional currency of Focus Universal (Shenzhen) Technology Co. LTD, a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus located in China, is the Renminbi (“RMB”).

 

For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, USD. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during each reporting period. Stockholders’ equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.

 

 

 

                                                                   13                                                                   

 

 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange difference, presented as foreign currency transaction loss, is included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exchange rates used for unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Going Concern

 

The Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has a net loss of $1,315,597 and $1,114,243 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $23,897,767 and $22,582,170 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $892,089 and $838,535 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently suffered recurring loss from operations, generated negative cash flow from operating activities, has an accumulated deficit and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments, in the amount of $114,096. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and it expects to continue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. In addition, subsequent to year end, the Company has entered into a letter of intent from a secondary buyer to potentially sell its land and buildings which upon completion, would provide additional working capital to the Company. No assurance can be given that the sale of the land and building will occur, or any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in future licensing agreements.

Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncement

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. The update also requires all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets to be provided in interim periods and for entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, including the significant segment expense disclosures. This standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning in fiscal year 2025, with early adoption permitted. The updates required by this standard should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.

Note 6 – Related Party Loan

 

On September 7, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Golden Sunrise Investment LLC in the amount of $1,000,000.

Narrative Description of the Business

 

Focus Universal Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Nevada corporation. We believe we have developed five proprietary technologies utilizing our patent portfolio which we believe solve the most fundamental problems plaguing the internet of things (“IoT”) industry through: (1) increasing overall chip integration by shifting integration from the component level to the device level; (2) creating a faster 5G cellular technology by using ultra-narrowband technology; (3) leveraging ultra-narrowband power line communication (“PLC”) technology; (4) proprietary User Interface Machine auto generation technology; and (5) incorporating all our core technologies into a single chip. Our Universal Smart Technology is designed to overcome instrumentation interoperability and interchangeability. The electronic design starts from a 90% completed common foundation we call our universal smart instrumentation platform (“USIP”), instead of the current method of building each stand-alone instrument from scratch. Our method eliminates redundant hardware and software and results in significant cost savings and production efficiency. . We also provide sensor devices and are a wholesaler of various air filters and digital, analog, and quantum light meter systems. The company holds 28 patents and patents pending in various phases of the patent process.

 

 

Our Current Products Include:

 

We are a wholesaler of various digital, analog, and quantum light meters and filtration products, including fan speed adjusters, carbon filters and HEPA filtration systems.

 

In an effort to continually develop our product lines, we plan to phase out the traditional, lower-margin products and are preparing to launch a new line of products that have been in development for several years. These newer technology products will be released in phases, and we intend that increasing amounts of technology will be layered upon these products. Additionally, we plan to continue to increase our efforts in protecting more intellectual property and have continued to develop technologies for long-term growth. We have developed products in both the controlled agriculture industry and home automation industries, taking advantage of our existing relationships in both sectors.

 

We are building a U.S. sales team to market our product lines. The team has already begun marketing our current Smart AVX-branded large format multimedia touch screens, surveillance camera system (cameras and network video recorders (NVRs)), indoor and outdoor LED screens, and Focus Universal-branded VOIP phone service systems.

 

Our products on the home automation front are beginning the production cycle. Of note, smart wall touch light switches, digital control smart wall touch light switches, smart timers, and smart controllers are ready for production. Sourcing of electronic parts for these products is completed, the cost analysis of these products is completed, and most of the tooling for production has been completed.

 

 

 

                                                                   22                                                                   

 

 

Currently, our Shenzhen subsidiary mainly focuses on product development and commercialization. An important electrode with a “Total Dissolved Solids” (“TDS”) meter design, with applications in all solubility measurements, was completed and approved by our U.S. management team. The designs of our TDS sensor, carbon dioxide sensor, new quantum PAR sensor and total dissolved oxygen sensors are also completed. Our testing against the state-of-the-art sensors on the market suggests to us that the new sensors are at least as good as the best quality sensors on the market. However, we believe that our sensors are much more cost effective.

 

Our software machine auto design team has also made significant progress. With mathematical and graphical environments having been created, our team is focusing on developing the 3D user interface machine auto design. Our public reporting automation software is completed and currently undergoing extensive testing. Reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K are time-consuming, complex processes that require each company’s financial team to gather and translate large amounts of data from multiple sources. The time and expertise required to complete the process is a substantial burden. Meanwhile, SEC reporting deadlines are firm and inflexible. This reality can interfere with other reporting timelines and leave a time-strapped team scrambling for the resources needed to meet all its reporting requirements. We have developed a Microsoft®-based add-on software that aims to streamline and automate the SEC reporting preparation process. We believe the software will significantly simplify the Form 10-Q and Form 10-K preparation processes and make creating, editing and managing documents both simple and accurate. We are planning to commercialize this software in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025. A cloud-based version of this software is also under the development.

 

Beyond IoT products, as a developer of a Natural Integrated Programming Language (NIPL) derivative product (i.e., our software platform for interoperability within the IoT), we have developed a complementary office automation software product. This specific software was designed to assist in completing financial reports faster, more accurately, and with greater ease of update, thereby eliminating the need for increased staffing especially in time sensitive projects. It is designed to save CPAs, auditors, accounting, and/or legal a significant amount of time in the preparation of SEC financial reports and other internal financial reporting. Eighty percent of this software development has been completed and we hope to launch a beta version of this product.

 

Fan speed adjuster device. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal electronic auto-resetting circuit breaker.

 

Carbon filter devices. We sell two types of carbon filter devices. These carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter the air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single-pass filter, which moves air out of the growing area, filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.

  

HEPA filtration device. We provide a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to our client Hydrofarm. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in various sizes.

 

Digital light meter. We provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles.

  

 

 

                                                                   23                                                                   

 

 

Quantum par meter. We provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 µmol.

 

Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device

 

We have developed a device we call the Ubiquitor, which replaces the functions of traditional digital measurement and sensing products by integrating many digital sensors and measurement tools into one single digital device. We believe the platform represents a technological advancement in the IoT marketplace by integrating large numbers of technologies, including cloud technology, wired and wireless communication technology, software programming, instrumentation technology, artificial intelligence, PLC technology, and sensor networking into a single platform. We believe the result of such integration is a smaller, cheaper, and faster circuit system design than those currently offered in the instrumentation market.

 

Our USIP technology that will make the Ubiquitor possible is an advanced software and hardware integrated instrumentation platform that uses a large-scale modular design approach. The large-scale modular design approach subdivides instruments into a foundation component (a USIP) and architecture-specific components (sensor nodes), which together replaces the functions of traditional instruments at a fraction of their cost. The USIP has an open architecture, incorporating a variety of individual instrument functions, sensors, and probes from different industries and vendors. The platform features the ability to connect potentially thousands of different sensors or probes, addressing major limitations present in traditional instrumentation systems.

 

The Ubiquitor will be a general platform that collects data in real time, up to 100 Hz per second, and, thus, is intended to be adapted to many industrial uses.

 

By using the universal hardware or USIP, we believe we could achieve the following efficiencies in instrumentation systems:

 

     1.   Cut production costs. Smartphone technology is widely used on the small sensor device market. By utilizing smartphone

           technology, the Ubiquitor will add superior functionality and performance, improve the product’s quality, and cut

           production

           costs.

           

     2.   Reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product. With the Ubiquitor, we believe that there will be no need for

           device manufacturers to research and develop new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop

           new sensor nodes or probes that may be integrated into our software

           technology.

           

     3.   Reduce clutter. It is anticipated that the Ubiquitor could dispense with some of the hassle of connecting cables, since the

           Ubiquitor allows wireless transmission of sensor data and may allow wireless access to networks, such as a PLC

           network.

 

Additional Focus Universal Inc. IoT Products under Smart AVX. Focus Universal Inc. is integrating its own Smart AVX- branded IoT equipment to connect devices across platform systems and to facilitate unified collaboration across audiovisual technologies, digital media technologies, security and surveillance technologies and communication technologies. This approach allows the Company to service its customers for ease of use, design and integration, and installation and maintenance by utilizing technology that integrates our five core technologies.

           for night vision capabilities, and a sturdy metal base to protect against damage or tampering, making the cameras an

           integrated solution for reliable surveillance in many use conditions. The cameras are PTZ, meaning that they are built with

           mechanical parts that allow for swiveling left to right, tilting up and down, and zooming in and out of a scene. They’re

           typically used to monitor wide open areas requiring a 180- or 360-degree view and are often deployed in guard stations

           where personnel can operate them through a remote controller. Depending on the camera or software, they can also be set to

           automatically follow motion-triggered activity to a pre-set schedule. PTZ cameras are generally implemented in tandem with

           a large surveillance system, in which the PTZ tracks movement while a fixed camera takes detailed

           shots.

           

     4.   VOIP Phone Services. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), also called IP telephony, is a method and group of technologies

           Internet. Focus Universal Inc. plans to provide daily use VOIP services in an integrated fashion to the existing commercial

           customer base, allowing for extensive usage in small business, commercial applications such as dental offices and other

           business

           scenarios.

 

Focus Universal Corporate Services 

 

Financial reporting is the process by which a company keeps investors aware of a company’s financial condition, allowing them to have the information they need before making an investment decision.

 

An annual report on Form 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly traded company information such as its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and other relevant data.

 

 

 

                                                                   25                                                                   

 

 

The quarterly report on Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company’s quarterly performance that must be submitted by all public companies to the SEC on a quarterly basis. The quarterly report on Form 10-Q is generally submitted with unaudited financial statements including condensed financial statements, a management discussion and analysis on the financial condition of the company, and disclosures regarding market risk and internal controls. In the quarterly reports, companies are required to disclose additional relevant quarterly financial information regarding their financial position.

 

Because of the depth and nature of the information they contain, reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q can become time-consuming, especially given the complex processes that require a company’s finance team to gather large amounts of data from multiple sources. The time and expertise required to complete the process is a substantial burden. SEC reporting deadlines are firm and inflexible. These reporting requirements can interfere with other reporting timelines and leave a time-strapped team scrambling for the resources needed to meet all of their mandated reporting requirements.

 

Delays and mistakes in SEC financial reporting can have far-reaching consequences for companies and their shareholders including. SEC review, enforcement actions, and penalties. Late filings can often lead to a drop in the company’s stock price and a decrease in investor confidence.

 

However, it is critically important that the company’s financial reporting is accurate, thorough, and up to date. Office software packages are widely used in all report preparation. While this software can do an excellent job on word processing, it often fails in the creation of the rigorously formatted tables and spreadsheets needed to populate the requisite financial information in the reports. Furthermore, because of the frequent incompatibility between programs in office software packages, the formatted tables required by financial reporting standards that are created by spreadsheets programs are destroyed when they are transferred a word processing file.

 

Human data entry of hundreds or thousands of financial numbers in the financial report imposes another challenge and presents risk of human error. This risk is compounded by the frequent requirement to update or revise these hundreds or thousands of numbers during the reviewing and auditing processes before submission.

 

Given the complexity and volume of data involved. Companies are looking for solutions that not only save cost, and reduce the time and effort required to report in a timely manner but also improve accuracy and compliance. We have has developed an automated software solution to address these challenges effectively and efficiently in the following ways:

 

Data Entry Automation: Our software’s automated data entry function reduces the risk of human errors and saves time. It is able to extract data from various sources and populate financial reports accurately.

 

Validation Checks: Our software includes built-in validation checks to ensure that the data is accurate and compliant with regulatory requirements. It also helps in identifying potential errors early in the reporting process.

 

Formatted Table Creation: Creating formatted tables which are often required in SEC financial reports, is a time-consuming task. Our software generates these tables accurately and efficiently.

 

Integration: Integration with existing financial systems and software is essential for a seamless reporting process. Our software connects with multiple data sources and financial software frequently used by reporting companies.

 

Security and Compliance: Security of data is critical, especially when dealing with sensitive financial data. Our software adheres to industry standards and regulations to ensure data security and compliance with reporting requirements.

Research and Development Efforts of Power Line Communication

 

Power Line Communication (“PLC”) technology is a communication technology that enables sending data over existing power cables. One advantage of this technology is that PLC does not require substantial new investment for its communications infrastructure. Rather, PLC utilizes existing power lines, thereby forming a distribution network that already penetrates all residential, commercial and industrial premises. Accordingly, connectivity via PLC technology is potentially the most cost-effective, scalable interconnectivity approach for the IoT. We believe PLC technology can be an integral part of our communication infrastructure for the IoT, which enables reliable, real-time measurements, monitoring, and control. A large variety of appliances may be interconnected by transmitting data through the same wires that provide electrical energy.

 

Our patented PLC technology uses an ultra-narrowband spectrum channel of less than 1 KHz to establish a long-distance link between transmitter and receiver. Thus, we believe that our proprietary ultra-narrowband PLC technology will offer a promising alternative to wireless networks and provide the backbone communication infrastructure for IoT devices.

 

 

 

                                                                   27                                                                   

 

 

The primary design goal of the power line network is electric power distribution, not data transmission. The harsh electrical noise present on power lines and variations in equipment and standards make data transmission over the power grid difficult. These technological challenges have impeded, or even halted, progression of PLC technology.

 

Research and Development Efforts of 5G Cellular Technology

 

Just like our ultra-narrowband technology can be used to effectively reduce noise in powerline communication technology, our internal research suggests that our ultra-narrowband technology can be leveraged to create a type of 5G wireless communication technology that can achieve both low band 5G coverage and an estimated 1 Gbps high band speed. We employ an ultra-narrow spectrum channel (<1KHz) to establish an ultra-long-distance link between the 5G base station and the receiver which reduces noise and interference entering the bandwidth.

 

For a description of the ultra-narrowband technology and the 5G applications, see “Part I - Item 1. Business, Section 2. “Creating a faster 5G cellular technology by using ultra-narrowband technology” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 

Intellectual Property Protection

 

On November 4, 2016, we filed U.S. patent application number 15/344,041 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent was issued on March 20, 2018.

 

We filed with the USPTO on June 2, 2017 a patent application regarding a process for improving a spectral response curve of a photo sensor. The resulting U.S. Patent No. 10,251,037 was issued on February 26, 2019.

 

On March 19, 2018, we filed U.S. Patent Application  No. 15/925,400. The patent title is a “Universal Smart Device,” which is a universal smart instrument that unifies heterogeneous measurement probes into a single device that can analyze, publish, and share the data analyzed. The resulting U.S. Patent No. 10,251,037 was issued on April 2, 2019.

 

On November 29, 2019, the Company filed an international utility patent application through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) as International Patent Application No. PCT/US2019/63880. On September 6, 2022, the International Searching Authority (ISA) issued a favorable International Preliminary Report of Patentability (IPRP) regarding this patent application, which describes the Company’s PLC technology. The IPRP cited only three category “A” documents, indicating that the Company’s application met both the novelty and non-obviousness patentability requirements. Consequently, the Company is optimistic that a patent including claims directed to its PLC technology will be issued in due course and will allow the Company to protect its PLC technology.

 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we hired the law firm of Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear, LLP (“Knobbe Martens”) to serve as outside intellectual property counsel for the Company. The firm is working on converting the Company’s provisional patent applications to formal nonprovisional patent applications and expanding existing patent portfolios. In addition, Knobbe Martens is working on filing four previously unfiled patents and pursuing patent coverage in Europe and Australia. In addition, in May 2022, the Company engaged Chang & Hale, LLP as suggested by our counsel at Knobbe Martens to assist with two new patents, noting that Knobbe Martens still remains our main IP counsel. Currently, the Company has 18 pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications and 9 issued U.S. patents.

 

The Company’s patent number 11,488,468 was allowed and subsequently issued on November 1, 2022. The patent is titled “Sensor for Detecting the Proximity of an IEEE 802.11 Protocol Connectable Device.” On November 7, 2023, our patent application titled “Activated Carbon Air Filter” issued as U.S. Patent No. 11,806,654. We also just received an issue notification from the USPTO, indicating that our patent application titled “Electronic Lock and Method of Operation” will issue on November 21, 2023, as U.S. Patent No. 11,823,513.

Competitors

 

We have identified several competitors specifically in the wireless sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or device manufacturers. Hach developed and launched the SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 32 digital sensors or analyzers. However, their products are not compatible with smart phones yet; and we believe their price point is still prohibitive to consumers. Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless and remote sensors. Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors that usually are not portable because of their power consumption. Also, the sensors’ real-time updates are slow; and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition may also be a concern. In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fees for using web-based services. We are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor device in conjunction with our smartphone application, which we believe will be a completely different product category.

 

IoT Installation Industry

 

There are several companies that compete with AVX in smart home installations, including Vivint Smart Home, Savant, Crestron and Control4. However, we believe we can distinguish ourselves from our competitors by offering substantially more customization and interoperability with existing platforms. While our service offerings do not rely on always providing the entire installation for the end client, our company is able to seamlessly provide accenting, replacement, or conversion home automation systems which are easier to use and interoperate for the end client, and with limited rewiring. Complete installation by Crestron ranges between $100,000 and $500,000 and an installation by Control4 ranges between $70,000 and $250,000. The cheapest competitor we can identify in this sector is Vivint Smart Home, which costs less than $50,000 to install; however, we understand that the Vivint Smart Home focuses on security systems only and that users have no other smart applications, which our smart home product line would include. Our sales staff have encountered a growing client base of unhappy customers with the pre-existing and completely siloed platform systems that reportedly are not easy to use or program, require costly specialty service for simple operations, are subject to lengthy software and hardware backlogs, and despite being based on the same platform, fail to operate compatibly, possessing frequent errors and bugs.

 

Air Filtration Systems and Meter Products Industry 

 

The air filtration system and meter products industry is a niche industry. Air purification methods are an effective way to control contaminants and improve indoor air quality; and as a result, many national and local governments overseeing indoor air quality and other emissions are enacting stricter workforce health and safety regulations in this area, which drives demand.

 

Market Potential

 

We believe universal wireless smart technology will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers, as currently the undertaking of an IoT project is simply too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies and carries a 75% failure rate according to Cisco Systems.1 The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them into their products or use them in their field testing. We also hope to play a role in academic laboratories, particularly with smaller academic laboratories that are sensitive to price. Regarding the larger IoT industry statistics, overall enterprise IoT spending increased to $201 billion in 2022, an increase of 21.5%. The outlook for growth in 2023 is 18.5% from this large base of enterprise spending.2 More specifically, the IoT sensors market is projected to reach $26 billion by 2026 from $11.1 billion in 2022.3 The IoT marketplace size assessments usually include the hardware components and the software components, which often contain a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Additionally, the rising need for reliable high bandwidth communication for IoT devices is expected to rise to $664.75 billion in 2028, spearheaded by the currently predominant services in the 5G category.4 We would also expect this market to grow with the addition of new categories of services delivering reliable high bandwidth communication for IoT devices and would cannibalize and expand the existing services where the new services proved to be more effective and efficient.

Our consolidated gross revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $219,158 and $236,095, respectively. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $16,937 due to a sales decrease from our IoT installation service due to a reduction in the number of projects in 2024.

 

Cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $219,357, compared to $180,744 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. In addition to the decrease in revenue, gross profit decreased to $199 compared to $55,351 three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Selling expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $39,285, compared to $11,859 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Selling expense incurred was mainly from third party advertising fees and marketing related fee. The increase of selling expense was due to an increase in advertising fees.

Research and development costs were $343,277 and $276,481 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to an increase in the number of research and development patent fees.

 

Professional fees were $352,611 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $257,399 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in these professional fees compared to the prior period was due to an increase in professional legal fees for prior employment litigation.

 

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $527,645 compared to $443,052 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of office employees in 2024.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 

Our net cash outflows from operating activities of $892,089 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily the result of our net loss of $1,315,597 and changes in our operating assets and liabilities offset by the add-back of non-cash expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities includes a decrease in accounts receivable of $72,605, an increase in inventory of $125,286, a decrease in other receivable of $20,435, an increase in prepaid expense of $14,041, a decrease in operating lease right-of-use asset of $21,039, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $268,420, an increase in other current liabilities of $68,957, and an increase in lease liabilities of $64,960. Non-cash expense included add-backs of $7,629 in bad debt expense, $35,330 in depreciation expense, $1,475 in unrealized loss on marketable securities, $94,910 in stock-based compensation - shares, and $36,995 in stock option compensation.

Our net cash outflows from operating activities of $838,535 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily the result of our net loss of $1,114,243 and changes in our operating assets and liabilities offset by the add-back of non-cash expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities includes a decrease in accounts receivable of $8,832, a decrease in accounts receivable – related party of $34,507, a decrease in inventories of $13,109, an increase in prepaid expense of $80,511, a decrease in deposit of $8,617, an increase in operating lease right-of-use asset of $16,075, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $20,011, an increase in other current liabilities of $98,838, and a decrease in lease liabilities of $50,885. Non-cash expense included add-backs of $5,114 in bad debt expense, $42,041 in depreciation expense, $28,741 in amortization of intangible assets, $14,901 in realized loss on marketable securities, $149,404 in stock-based compensation - shares, and $133,403 in stock option compensation, reduces of $32,570 in unrealized gain on marketable equity securities and $61,747 in gain on bargain purchase.

 

We expect that cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results, utilization of new revenue streams, in line with our shifting revenue streams, collection of accounts receivable, and timing of billings and payments.

 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 we had cash outflow from investing activities of $5,044 from the purchase of property and equipment. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had cash inflow from investing activities of $61,824. That was primarily the result from the purchase of property and equipment of $9,920, purchase of marketable securities of $17,690, and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $89,434.

 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had cash inflows of $550,000 due to proceeds from third party and related party loan amount of $600,000 and repayment on third party loan amount of $50,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had cash outflows of $1,000,000 due to purchase of treasury stock.

 

Going Concern

 

The Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has a net loss of $1,315,597 and $1,114,243 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $23,897,767 and $22,582,170 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $892,089 and $838,535 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently suffered recurring loss from operations, generated negative cash flow from operating activities, has an accumulated deficit and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

 

 

                                                                   33                                                                   

 

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments, in the amount of $114,096. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and it expects to continue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. In addition, subsequent to year end, the Company has entered into a letter of intent with a secondary buyer to sell its land and buildings which upon completion, will provide additional working capital to the Company. No assurance can be given that the sale of the land and building will occur, or any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in future licensing agreements. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

As of March 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation SK.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a15(e) and 15d15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our Company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.

 

Our management concluded we did not maintain effective controls over the Company’s financial reporting. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, caused principally by inadequate staffing and technical expertise in key positions, resulted in overly relying on outside consultants to make numerous adjustments to our financial statements. Additionally, the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses could result in future material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Management has concluded that the identified control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.

 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls

 

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives. The likelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact that human judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process.
