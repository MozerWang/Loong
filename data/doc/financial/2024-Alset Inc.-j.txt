Nature of Operations

 

Alset Inc. (the “Company” or “AEI”), formerly known as Alset EHome International Inc. and HF Enterprises Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 7, 2018. On October 4, 2022, through a merger transaction, the Company was reincorporated in Texas. AEI is a diversified holding company principally engaged through its subsidiaries in the development of EHome communities and other real estate, financial services, digital transformation technologies, biohealth activities and consumer products with operations in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea and China. We manage a significant portion of our businesses through our 85.5% owned subsidiary, Alset International Limited (“Alset International”), a public company traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange.

 

The Company has four operating segments based on the products and services we offer, which include three of our principal businesses – real estate, digital transformation technology and biohealth – as well as a fourth category consisting of certain other business activities.

 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

 

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim reporting. These interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company’s annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial information. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other interim periods or for any other future years. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on April 1, 2024.

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns more than 50% of the voting common stock and controls operations. All intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of real estate assets, allocation of development costs and capitalized interest to sold lots, fair value of the investments, the valuation allowance of deferred taxes, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

In our property development business, land acquisition costs are allocated to each lot based on the area method, the size of the lot compared to the total size of all lots in the project. Development costs and capitalized interest are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project.

 

If allocation of development costs and capitalized interest based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on area method, the size of the lot compared to the total size of all lots in the project.

 

When the Company purchases properties but does not receive the assessment information from the county, the Company allocates the values between land and building based on the data of similar properties. The Company makes appropriate adjustments once the assessment from the county is received. At the same time, any necessary adjustments to depreciation expense are made in the income statement. On March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company adjusted $0 and $951,349 between building and land, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company adjusted depreciation expenses of $0 and $0, respectively.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and at the bank and short-term deposits with financial institutions that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in values. There were no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Restricted Cash

 

As a condition to the loan agreement with the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”), the Company was required to maintain a minimum of $2,600,000 in an interest-bearing account maintained by the lender as additional security for the loans. The fund was required to remain as collateral for the loan and outstanding letters of credit until the loan and letters of credit are paid off in full and the loan agreement is terminated. The loan has expired during 2022 and only letters of credit were outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On March 15, 2022 approximately $2,300,000 was released from collateral. On December 14, 2023 additional $201,751 was released from collateral. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total balance of this account was $107,793 and $107,767, respectively.

 

The Company puts money into brokerage accounts specifically for equity investment. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cash balance in these brokerage accounts was $857,541 and $859,799, respectively.

 

Investments held in Trust Account

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $0 and $21.0 million, respectively, in investments in treasury securities held in the Trust Account. The funds in the Trust Account were subject to redemption by investors of HWH International Inc. (formerly known as Alset Capital Acquisition Corp.)

Account Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses

 

Account receivables is recorded at invoiced amounts net of an allowance for credit losses and do not bear interest. The allowance for credit losses is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company’s existing accounts receivable. The measurement and recognition of credit losses involves the use of judgment. Management’s assessment of expected credit losses includes consideration of current and expected economic conditions, market and industry factors affecting the Company’s customers (including their financial condition), the aging of account balances, historical credit loss experience, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, and the existence of sources of payment The Company also establishes an allowance for credit losses for specific receivables when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Account receivables considered uncollectible are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was an immaterial amount. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of account receivables was $85,427 and $77,517, respectively.

 

Other Receivables

 

Other receivables include developer reimbursements for Lakes at Black Oak project. The Company records an allowance for credit losses based on previous collection experiences, the creditability of the organizations that are supposed to reimburse us, the forecasts from the third-party engineering company and Moody’s credit ratings. The allowance amount for these reimbursements was immaterial at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company does not expect that investors will repay the promissory notes when due, as the value of the shares is significantly lower than the original purchase price of $10 per share. The Company expects that all the shares will be returned to the Company at the notes’ maturity date and the notes will be canceled as well. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized the receivable or any gain or loss related to the transaction.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method and includes all costs in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inventory consisted of finished goods from subsidiaries of HWH International Inc. and Hapi Metaverse Inc. The Company continuously evaluates the need for reserve for obsolescence and possible price concessions required to write-down inventories to net realizable value.

Investment Securities at Cost

 

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment adjusted by observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. These investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.

There has been no indication of impairment or changes in observable prices via transactions of similar securities and investments are still carried at cost.

 

Equity Method Investment

 

The Company accounts for equity investment in entities with significant influence under equity-method accounting. Under this method, the Group’s pro rata share of income (loss) from investment is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When the Company’s share of loss in an equity-method investee equals or exceeds its carrying value of the investment in that entity, the equity method investment can be reduced below zero based on losses, if the Company either is liable for the obligations of the investee or provides for losses in excess of the investment when imminent return to profitable operations by the investee appears to be assured. Otherwise, the Company does not recognize its share of equity method losses exceeding its carrying amount of the investment, but discloses the losses in the footnotes. Equity-method investment is reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. In making this determination, factors are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. These include consideration of the intent and ability of the Group to hold investment and the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, justifying the carrying amount of the investment. Impairment losses are recognized in other expense when a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Variable Interest Entity

 

Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (“VIE”), as defined in ASC 810, the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights, obligations, and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.

 

The Company evaluates its interests in VIEs on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.

 

Real Estate Assets

 

Real estate assets are recorded at cost, except when real estate assets are acquired that meet the definition of a business combination in accordance with FASB ASC 805 - “Business Combinations”, which acquired assets are recorded at fair value. Interest, property taxes, insurance and other incremental costs (including salaries) directly related to a project are capitalized during the construction period of major facilities and land improvements. The capitalization period begins when activities to develop the parcel commence and ends when the asset constructed is completed. The capitalized costs are recorded as part of the asset to which they relate and are reduced when lots are sold.

 

                                                                  F-12

 

 

The Company capitalized construction costs of approximately $3 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

The Company’s policy is to obtain an independent third-party valuation for each major project in the United States as part of our assessment of identifying potential triggering events for impairment. Management may use the market comparison method to value other relatively small projects. In addition to the annual assessment of potential triggering events in accordance with ASC 360 – Property Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”), the Company applies a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value assets on an annual basis and on an interim basis if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred.

 

The Company did not record impairment on any of its projects during the three months ended on March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Properties under development

 

Properties under development are properties being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of business, rather than to be held for the Company’s own use, rental or capital appreciation.

 

Rental Properties

 

Rental properties are acquired with the intent to be rented to tenants. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned 132 homes. The aggregate purchase cost of all the homes is $30,998,258. These homes are located in Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas. All of these purchased homes are properties of our rental business.

 

Investments in Single-Family Residential Properties

 

The Company accounts for its investments in single-family residential properties as asset acquisitions and records these acquisitions at their purchase price. The purchase price is allocated between land, building and improvements based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price for purposes of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees, title fees, property inspection and valuation fees, as well as other closing costs.

 

Building improvements and buildings are depreciated over estimated useful lives of approximately 10 to 27.5 years, respectively, using the straight-line method.

 

The Company assesses its investments in single-family residential properties for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When such events occur, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the asset’s carrying value with its fair value. Should impairment exist, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses during three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Rental of Model Houses

 

In May 2023, the Company entered into lease agreement for one of its model houses located in Montgomery County, Texas.

Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenue

 

ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.

 

                                                                  F-13

 

 

In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. The provisions of ASC 606 include a five-step process by which the determination of revenue recognition, depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts reflecting the payment to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 requires the Company to apply the following steps:

 

(1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.

 

The following represents the Company’s revenue recognition policies by Segments:

 

Real Estate

 

Property Sales

 

Part of the Company’s real estate business is land development. The Company purchases land and develops it for building into residential communities. The developed lots are sold to builders (customers) for the construction of new homes. The builders enter a sales contract with the Company before they take the lots. The prices and timeline are determined and agreed upon in the contract. The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions and requirements in contracts are met before purchasing the lots. A detailed breakdown of the five-step process for the revenue recognition of the Lakes at Black Oak project, which represented approximately 83% and 0% of the Company’s revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:

 

     ●    Identify the contract with a customer.

 

The Company has signed agreements with the builders for developing the raw land to ready to build lots. The contract has agreed upon prices, timelines, and specifications for what is to be provided.

 

     ●    Identify the performance obligations in the contract.

 

Performance obligations of the Company include delivering developed lots to the customer, which are required to meet certain specifications that are outlined in the contract. The customer inspects all lots prior to accepting title to ensure all specifications are met.

 

     ●    Determine the transaction price.

 

The transaction price per lot is fixed and specified in the contract. Any subsequent change orders or price changes are required to be approved by both parties.

 

     ●    Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract.

 

Each lot or a group of lots is considered to be a separate performance obligation, for which the specified price in the contract is allocated to.

 

     ●    Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

 

The builders do the inspections to make sure all conditions/requirements are met before taking title of lots. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when title is transferred. The Company does not have further performance obligations or continuing involvement once title is transferred. Revenue is recognized at a point in time.

 

                                                                  F-14

 

 

Rental Revenue

 

The Company leases real estate properties to its tenants under leases that are predominately classified as operating leases, in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). Real estate rental revenue is comprised of minimum base rent and revenue from the collection of lease termination fees.

 

Rent from tenants is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease agreement on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant controls the space and continues through the term of the related lease. Generally, at the end of the lease term, the Company provides the tenant with a one-year renewal option, including mostly the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, subject to rent increases.

 

The Company defers rental revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. These amounts are presented within deferred revenues and other payables on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

 

Rental revenue is subject to an evaluation for collectability on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, historical operations and operating trends of the property, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates that it is not probable that we will recover substantially all of the receivable, rental revenue is limited to the lesser of the rental revenue that would be recognized on a straight-line basis (as applicable) or the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee. Differences between rental revenue recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged to straight-line rent receivable or straight-line rent liability, as applicable. In the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not recognize any deferred revenue and collected all rents due.

 

Cost of Revenues

 

Real Estate

 

     ●    Cost of Real Estate Sale 

 

All of the costs of real estate sales are from our land development business. Land acquisition costs are allocated to each lot based on the area method, the size of the lot comparing to the total size of all lots in the project. Development costs and capitalized interest are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project.

 

If allocation of development costs and capitalized interest based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on area method, the size of the lot comparing to the total size of all lots in the project.

 

     ●    Cost of Rental Revenue 

 

Cost of rental revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with management and leasing fees to our management company, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and other related administrative costs. Utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.

 

                                                                  F-15

 

 

Biohealth

 

     ●    Product Direct Sales

 

The Company’s net sales consist of product sales. The Company’s performance obligation is to transfer ownership of its products to its members. The Company generally recognizes revenue when product is delivered to its members. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes, allowances, refund or returns. The Company receives the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale.

 

If any member returns a product to the Company on a timely basis, they may obtain a replacement product from the Company for such returned products. We do not have buyback program. However, when the customer requests a return and management decides that the refund is necessary, we initiate the refund after deducting all the benefits that a member has earned. The returns are deducted from our sales revenue on our financial statements. Allowances for product and membership returns are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale. Product and membership returns for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0 and $1,162, respectively.

 

     ●    Annual Membership

 

The Company collects an annual membership fee from its members. The fee is fixed, paid in full at the time upon joining the membership; the fee is not refundable. The Company’s performance obligation is to provide its members the right to (a) purchase products from the Company, (b) access to certain back-office services, (c) receive commissions and (d) attend corporate events. The associated performance obligation is satisfied over time, generally over the term of the membership agreement which is for a one-year period. Before the membership fee is recognized as revenue, it is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue relating to membership was $0 and $0 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Starting in 2020 the revenue from sale of membership declined to $0 in 2022. The Company is currently working on a new membership model.

     ●    Remaining performance obligations

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no remaining performance obligations or continuing involvement, as all service obligations within the other business activities segment have been completed.

 

                                                                  F-16

 

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation”. ASC 718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock option forfeitures are recognized at the date of employee termination. During the three months ended on March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $0 as stock-based compensation expense.

 

Foreign currency

 

Functional and reporting currency

 

Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“functional currency”). The financial statements of the Company are presented in U.S. dollars (the “reporting currency”).

 

The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (“U.S. dollar”). The financial records of the Company’s subsidiaries located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea and the People’s Republic of China are maintained in their local currencies, the Singapore Dollar (S$), Hong Kong Dollar (HK$), Australian Dollar (“AUD”), South Korean Won (“KRW”) and Chinese Yuan (CN¥), which are also the functional currencies of these entities.

 

Transactions in foreign currencies

 

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the periods are converted into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occurred. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations.

 

The majority of the Company’s foreign currency transaction gains or losses come from the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on the intercompany loans between Singapore entities and U.S. entities. The Company recorded foreign exchange gain of $1,193,636 and $788,302 loss during the three months ended on March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recorded in operations.

 

Translation of consolidated entities’ financial statements

 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The Company’s entities with functional currency of S$, HK$, AUD, KRW and CN¥, translate their operating results and financial positions into the U.S. dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenue, expense, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss).

 

The Company recorded other comprehensive loss of $1,161,932 from foreign currency translation for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1,095,943 gain for the three months ended March 31, 2023, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 

Earnings (loss) per Share

 

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share data for its common shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common stock shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares held by the Company.

 

Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common stock shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for treasury shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible securities, such as stock options, convertible bonds and warrants. At March 31, 2024 there were 425,216 potentially dilutive warrants outstanding. At December 31, 2023 there were 425,216 potentially dilutive warrants outstanding.

 

                                                                  F-17

 

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity; therefore, the inputs are developed by the Company using estimates and assumptions that the Company expects a market participant would use, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.

 

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The liabilities in connection with the conversion and make-whole features included within certain of the Company’s notes payable and warrants are each classified as a level 3 liability.

 

Non-controlling interests

 

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company, and are presented separately in the condensed consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income, and within equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, separately from equity attributable to owners of the Company.

 

On March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate non-controlling interests in the Company were $8,371,464 and $8,601,562, respectively.

 

Capitalized Financing Costs

 

Financing costs, such as loan origination fee, administration fee, interests, and other related financing costs should be capitalized and recorded on the balance sheet, if these financing activities are directly associated with the development of real estate.

 

Capitalized financing costs are allocated to lots sold based on the total expected development and interest costs of the completed project and allocating a percentage of those costs based on the selling price of the sold lot compared to the expected sales values of all lots in the project. If the allocation of capitalized financing costs based on the projection and relative expected sales value is impracticable, those costs could also be allocated based on an area method, which uses the size of the lots compared to the total project area and allocates costs based on their size.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the capitalized financing costs were $756,942 and $1,225,739, respectively.

 

3. CONCENTRATIONS

 

The Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions in different countries. These balances are usually secured by the central banks’ insurance companies. At times, these balances may exceed the insurance limits. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, uninsured cash and restricted cash balances were $20,945,321 and $23,748,169, respectively.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 100% of the Company’s property development revenue.

 

4. SEGMENTS

 

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision–making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is the CEO. The Company operates in and reports four business segments: real estate, digital transformation technology, biohealth, and other business activities. The Company’s reportable segments are determined based on the services they perform and the products they sell, not on the geographic area in which they operate. The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance based on segment revenue. Costs excluded from segment income (loss) before taxes and reported as “Other” consist of corporate general and administrative activities which are not allocable to the four reportable segments.

 

                                                                  F-18

M&T Bank Loan

 

On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of $8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount of $18,500,000. The line of credit bore interest rate on LIBOR plus 375 basis points. SeD Maryland Development LLC was also provided with a Letter of Credit (“L/C”) Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $900,000. The L/C commission will be 1.5% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees will apply in the event L/C is drawn down. The loan is a revolving line of credit. The L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed.

Business Combination of Alset Capital Acquisition Corp. and HWH International Inc.

 

On January 9, 2024, two entities affiliated with Alset Inc. completed a previously announced transaction. On September 9, 2022, Alset Capital entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with our indirect subsidiary HWH International Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HWH”) and HWH Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (“Merger Sub”). The Company and its 85.5% owned subsidiary Alset International own Alset Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, the sponsor (the “Sponsor”) of Alset Capital.

 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 9, 2024, a business combination between Alset Capital and HWH was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into HWH, with HWH surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (the “Merger”), and Alset Capital changing its name to HWH International Inc. (“New HWH”).

 

The total consideration paid at the closing of the Merger by New HWH to the HWH shareholders was 12,500,000 shares of New HWH common stock. Alset International owned the majority of the outstanding shares of HWH at the time of the business combination, and received 10,900,000 shares of New HWH as consideration for its shares of HWH.

 

New HWH currently has 16,223,301 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Of these shares, a total of 13,577,375 shares of New HWH common stock are now owned by the Sponsor and Alset International together. In addition, the Sponsor owns warrants convertible into up to 236,875 shares of New HWH common stock upon exercise.

 

The transaction described above was a transaction between entities under common control. In the transactions under common control, financial statements and financial information were presented as of the beginning of the period as though the assets and liabilities had been transferred at that date. The company controlled both entities and accordingly, the equity was eliminated in consolidation.

 

                                                                  F-22

 

 

Purchase of Hapi Travel Ltd. Stock

 

On June 14, 2023, the Company’s subsidiary completed acquisition of Hapi Travel Limited (“HTL”), an online travel business started in Hong Kong and under common control of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entity from its acquisition date. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition is initially allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The recorded amounts for assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional and subject to change during the measurement period, which is up to 12 months from the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition of HTL, a deemed dividend of $214,174 was generated as a result of the business combination, which represents the purchase price of $214,993 in excess of identifiable equity.

 

The common control transaction described above resulted in the following basis of accounting for the financial reporting periods:

 

     ●    The acquisition of HTL was accounted for prospectively as of June 14, 2023 as this did not represent a change in reporting

           entity.

     ●    The acquisition of HTL was under common control and was consolidated in accordance with ASC 850-50. The Consolidated

           financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of HTL as of January 1, 2022 for comparative

           purposes because the historical operations of HTL were deemed to be immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial

           statements.

 

Convertible Notes to Value Exchange

 

On January 27, 2023, the Company and New Electric CV Corporation (together with the Company, the “Lenders”) entered into a Convertible Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with VEII.

Each Advance shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of VEII’s Common Stock at the option of the Lender who made that Advance (being referred to as a “Conversion”), at any time and from time to time, at a price per share equal the “Conversion Price”. In the event that a Lender elects to convert any portion of an Advance into shares of VEII Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that Advance, then VEII would issue to the Lender five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII’s Common Stock issued in a Conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the Lender to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant. On February 23, 2023, Hapi Metaverse loaned VEII $1,400,000 (the “Loan Amount”).

Under the Credit Agreement, as amended, this amount can be converted into VEII’s Common Shares pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement for a period of three years. In the event that Hapi Metaverse converts this loan into shares of VEII’s Common Stock, the conversion price shall be $0.045 per share. In the event that Hapi Metaverse elects to convert any portion of the loan into shares of VEII’s Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that loan, then VEII will issue to Hapi Metaverse five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII’s Common Stock issued in a conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the company to purchase one (1) share of VEII’s Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant. The fair value of this convertible note on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $323,497 and $1,106,477, respectively.

8. GOODWILL

 

The Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions that align with the Company’s plans, namely, starting the F&B business in Asia. Starting an F&B business in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan can be an excellent opportunity due to the large consumer market, diverse food culture, high demand for international cuisine, favorable business environment, skilled labor force, and opportunities for growth. On October 4, 2022, The Company has completed its first F&B business acquisition of MOC HK Limited (“MOC”), a F&B business started in Hong Kong. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entity from its acquisition date. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition is initially allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated acquisition date fair values.

 

As a result of the acquisition of MOC, goodwill of $60,343 generated in a business combination represents the purchase price of $70,523 in excess of identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead, they are reviewed periodically for impairment.

 

                                                                  F-25

 

 

The Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment losses.

 

The following table summarizes changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the years ended December 31, 2023.

The Company analyzed the Preferred stock and the embedded conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging” and determined that the conversion option should be classified as equity.

 

On February 6, 2023, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) in connection with an offering (the “Offering”) of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), with Aegis Capital Corp. (the “Underwriter”) as the underwriter, relating to an underwritten public offering of 1,727,273 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $2.20 per share. The Underwriting Agreement provides the Underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 212,863 shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $3.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and the payment of other offering expenses associated with the Offering that are payable by the Company.

 

The Offering closed on February 8, 2023. The Common Stock was being offered pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264234), as well as a prospectus supplement in connection with the Offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Class A Common Stock of HWH International Inc. Subject to Possible Redemption

 

The Company accounts for its, and its subsidiaries’ common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”. Common stock subject to possible redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including shares of common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, shares of common stock are classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2023, the Class A common stock of HWH International Inc. subject to possible redemption in the amount of $20,457,011, are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheets. On March 31, 2024, following redemptions and closing of business combination the temporary equity is $0.

 

On May 1, 2023, after the redemptions (for further details on this transaction refer to Note 7. – Related Party Transactions, Consolidation of HWH International Inc.), the Company consolidated HWH International Inc.

This agreement was effective at the closing of business combination on January 9, 2024. The 149,443 shares were issued as of the price of $10.10, totaling the amount of $1,509,375. The fair value of the HWH shares at issuance on January 9, 2024 was $2.82 per share or $421,429. No gain or loss was recognized upon issuance of the shares on January 9, 2024 as this was an adjustment to prior underwriting costs accounted for in equity.

The fair value of the SHRG warrants under level 2 category as of March 31, 2024, was calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model valued with the following weighted average assumptions:

Convertible Loan Receivables

 

The Company has elected to recognize the convertible loan receivables at fair value and therefore there was no further evaluation of embedded features for bifurcation. The Company engaged third party valuation firm to perform the valuation of convertible loans. The fair value of the convertible loans is calculated using the binomial tree model based on probability of remaining as straight debt using discounted cash flow.

Lots Sales Agreement

 

     ●    Ballenger Project

 

Certain arrangements for the sale of buildable lots to NVR require the Company to credit NVR with an amount equal to one year of the FFB assessment. Under ASC 606, the credits to NVR are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and accordingly, the amount of the credit was recognized as the reduction of revenue. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued balance due to NVR was $189,475.

 

     ●    Lakes at Black Oak Project

 

          -    Agreement to Sell 142 Lots and 63 Lots

 

On November 13, 2023, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd. (the “Seller”), a Texas Limited Partnership, entered into two Contracts for Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions (each an “Agreement,” collectively, the “Agreements”) with Century Land Holdings of Texas, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of one of the aforementioned Agreements, the Seller has agreed to sell approximately 142 single-family detached residential lots comprising a section of a residential community in the city of Magnolia, Texas known as the “Lakes at Black Oak.” The selling price of these lots is anticipated to equal approximately $7.4 million. Pursuant to the other Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell 63 single-family detached residential lots in the city of Magnolia, Texas. In 2021, our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. acquired approximately 19.5 acres of partially developed land near Houston, Texas which was used to develop a community named Alset Villas (“Alset Villas”). Alset EHome was in the process of developing the 63 lots at Alset Villas in 2023. The selling price of these lots is anticipated to equal approximately $3.3 million. The closing of the transactions described above depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions, and is expected to take place during the second quarter of 2024.

The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”) to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all the leases with terms greater than twelve months. We elected the practical expedient to not recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for lease agreements with terms less than 12 months. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rates, we estimate our incremental borrowing rates to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. Our incremental borrowings rates are at a range from 0.35% to 7.22% per annum in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which were used as the discount rates. At March 31, 2024 the weighted average remaining lease term is 1.97 years and weighted average discount rate is 4.36. The balances of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2024 were $1,514,903 and $1,548,903. The balances of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were $1,467,372 and $1,499,263, respectively.

 

The table below summarizes future payments due under these leases as of March 31, 2024.

Consummation of the Merger of Alset Capital Acquisition Corp. and HWH International Inc.

 

On January 9, 2024, two entities affiliated with Alset Inc. completed a previously announced transaction. On September 9, 2022, Alset Capital Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Alset Capital”) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with our indirect subsidiary HWH International Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HWH”) and HWH Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (“Merger Sub”). The Company and its 85.5% owned subsidiary Alset International own Alset Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, the sponsor (the “Sponsor”) of Alset Capital.

 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 9, 2024, a business combination between Alset Capital and HWH was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into HWH, with HWH surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (the “Merger”), and Alset Capital changing its name to HWH International Inc. (“New HWH”).

 

                                                                   3



                                                         

 

The total consideration paid at the closing of the Merger by New HWH to the HWH shareholders was 12,500,000 shares of New HWH common stock. Alset International owned the majority of the outstanding shares of HWH at the time of the business combination, and received 10,900,000 shares of New HWH as consideration for its shares of HWH.

 

New HWH currently has 16,223,301 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Of these shares, a total of 13,577,375 shares of New HWH common stock are now owned by the Sponsor and Alset International together. In addition, the Sponsor owns warrants convertible into up to 236,875 shares of New HWH common stock upon exercise.

 

New HWH is in the midst of implementing the new membership model described below (the “New Model”), that operates on a yearly subscription basis. New HWH intends to resume membership sales, albeit under the New Model, in approximately 2nd quarter of 2024.

 

HWH Members get exclusive discounts on HWH Marketplace products, priority invites to product launch events and other parties, and can earn passive income when a member’s referral signs up for membership or makes an initial purchase through the HWH Marketplace products through them.

 

Purchase of Rental Business from Majority-Owned Subsidiary

 

On December 9, 2022, Alset Inc. entered into an agreement with Alset EHome Inc. and Alset International pursuant to which Alset Inc. agreed to reorganize the ownership of its home rental business. Previously, Alset Inc. and certain majority-owned subsidiaries collectively owned 132 single-family rental homes in Texas. 112 of these rental homes are owned by subsidiaries of American Home REIT Inc. (“AHR”). Alset Inc. owns 85.5% of Alset International, and Alset International indirectly owns approximately 99.9% of Alset EHome Inc.

 

The closing of the transaction contemplated by this agreement was completed on January 13, 2023. Pursuant to this agreement, Alset Inc. has become the direct owner of AHR and its subsidiaries that collectively own these 112 homes, instead of such homes being owned indirectly through Alset International’s subsidiaries.

 

Alset EHome Inc. sold AHR to Alset Inc. for a total consideration of $26,250,933, including the forgiveness of debt in the amount of $13,900,000, a promissory note in the amount of $11,350,933 and a cash payment of $1,000,000. This purchase price represents the book value of AHR as of November 30, 2022.

 

The closing of this transaction was approved by the shareholders of Alset International and the transaction was closed on January 13, 2023. Certain members of Alset Inc.’s Board of Directors and management are also members of the Board of Directors and management of each of Alset International and Alset EHome Inc.

 

Public Offering

 

On February 6, 2023, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) in connection with an offering (the “Offering”) of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), with Aegis Capital Corp. (the “Underwriter”) as the underwriter, relating to an underwritten public offering of 1,727,273 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $2.20 per share. The Underwriting Agreement provides the Underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 212,863 shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments, if any.

 

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $3.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and the payment of other offering expenses associated with the Offering that are payable by the Company.

 

                                                                   4



                                                         

 

The Offering closed on February 8, 2023. The Common Stock was being offered pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264234), as well as a prospectus supplement in connection with the Offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

Purchase of Travel Business

 

On June 14, 2023, the Company’s subsidiary completed acquisition of Hapi Travel Limited (“HTL”), an online travel business started in Hong Kong and under common control of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entity from its acquisition date. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition is initially allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The recorded amounts for assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional and subject to change during the measurement period, which is up to 12 months from the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition of HTL, a deemed dividend of $214,174 was generated as a result of the business combination, which represents the purchase price of $214,993 in excess of identifiable equity.

 

The common control transaction described above resulted in the following basis of accounting for the financial reporting periods:

 

     ●    The acquisition of HTL was accounted for prospectively as of June 14, 2023 as this did not represent a change in reporting

           entity.

     ●    The acquisition of HTL was under common control and was consolidated in accordance with ASC 850-50. The Consolidated

           financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of HTL as of January 1, 2022 for comparative

           purposes because the historical operations of HTL were deemed to be immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial

           statements.

Issuance of Convertible Loans to Value Exchange International, Inc.

 

On January 27, 2023, the Company and New Electric CV Corporation (together with the Company, the “Lenders”) entered into a Convertible Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with VEII. The Credit Agreement provides VEII with a maximum credit line of $1,500,000 with simple interest accrued on any advances of the money under the Credit Agreement at 8%. The Credit Agreement grants conversion rights to each Lender. Each Advance shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of VEII’s Common Stock at the option of the Lender who made that Advance (being referred to as a “Conversion”), at any time and from time to time, at a price per share equal the “Conversion Price”. In the event that a Lender elects to convert any portion of an Advance into shares of VEII Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that Advance, then VEII would issue to the Lender five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII’s Common Stock issued in a Conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the Lender to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant. On February 23, 2023, Hapi Metaverse loaned VEII $1,400,000 (the “Loan Amount”).

Under the Credit Agreement, as amended, this amount can be converted into VEII’s Common Shares pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement for a period of three years.

In the event that Hapi Metaverse elects to convert any portion of the loan into shares of VEII’s Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that loan, then VEII will issue to Hapi Metaverse five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII’s Common Stock issued in a conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the company to purchase one (1) share of VEII’s Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant. At the time of this filing, the company has not converted the Loan Amount.

Revenue was $6,086,207 and $926,936 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in property sales from the Lakes at Black Oak Project in the first three months of 2024 contributed to higher revenue in this period.

 

The Company plans to continue its near-term focus on lot sales to regional and national builders. Funds from such lot sales will substantially improve the Company’s liquidity, strengthen its financial position and meet is working capital requirements.

 

Revenue from rental business was $707,592 and $633,811 in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects that the revenue from this business will continue to increase as we acquire more rental houses and successfully rent them.

Cost of revenues increased from $689,281 in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $4,658,367 in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase is a result of the increase in sales in the Lakes at Black Oak Project. Capitalized construction expenses, finance costs and land costs are allocated to sales. We anticipate the total cost of revenues to increase as revenue increases.

 

The gross margin increased from $237,655 to $1,427,840 in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase of gross margin was caused by the increase in sales in the Lakes at Black Oak Project.

 

The following tables sets forth period-over-period changes in operating expenses for each of our reporting segments.

The increase of operating expenses in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was mostly caused by recording of goodwill and investment.

 

Other Income (Expense)

 

In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had other expenses of $5,047,279 compared to other expenses of $2,233,452 in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The gain on sale of stock of subsidiary and foreign exchange transaction gain are the primary reason for the volatility in these two periods. Gain on the sale of stock of subsidiary was $15,695,977 in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0 gain in the three months ended March 31, 2023. Foreign exchange transaction gain was $1,193,636 the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a loss of $788,302 in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Net Loss

 

In the three months ended March 31, 2024 the Company had net loss of $7,313,792 compared to net loss of $4,323,182 in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

                                                                   9



                                                         

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Our real estate assets have decreased to $39,883,629 as of March 31, 2024 from $42,137,152 as of December 31, 2023. This decrease reflects the sale of multiple lots in Lakes at Black Oak project during first three months of 2024.

 

Our cash has decreased from $26,921,727 as of December 31, 2023 to $23,727,542 as of March 31, 2024. Our liabilities decreased from $9,066,700 at December 31, 2023 to $6,670,132 at March 31, 2024. Our total assets have decreased to $96,710,288 as of March 31, 2024 from $126,314,028 as of December 31, 2023 mainly due to decrease in cash held in Trust Account after shareholders of HWH International Inc. redeemed their shares.

 

On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of $8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount of $18,500,000. The line of credit bore interest rate on LIBOR plus 375 basis points. SeD Maryland Development LLC was also provided with a Letter of Credit (“L/C”) Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $900,000. The L/C commission will be 1.5% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees will apply in the event the L/C is drawn down. The loan is a revolving line of credit. The L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed. Repayment of the Loan Agreement is secured by a $2,600,000 collateral fund and a Deed of Trust issued to the Lender on the property owned by SeD Maryland. On March 15, 2022, approximately $2,300,000 was released from collateral, leaving approximately $300,000 as collateral for outstanding letters of credit. On December 14, 2023 approximately $201,751 was released from collateral, leaving approximately $100,000 as collateral for outstanding letters of credit.

 

The future development timeline of Lakes at Black Oak will be based on multiple conditions, including the amount of funds which may be raised from capital markets, the loans we may secure from third party financial institutions, and government reimbursements which may be received. The development will be step by step and expenses will be contingent on the amount of funding we will receive.

 

On November 13, 2023, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd. (the “Seller”), a Texas Limited Partnership, entered into two Contracts for Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions (each an “Agreement,” collectively, the “Agreements”) with Century Land Holdings of Texas, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of one of the aforementioned Agreements, the Seller has agreed to sell approximately 142 single-family detached residential lots (the “Section 4 Agreement”) comprising a section of a residential community in the city of Magnolia, Texas known as the “Lakes at Black Oak.” The selling price of these lots is anticipated to equal approximately $7.4 million. Pursuant to the other Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell 63 single-family detached residential lots (the “Alset Villas Agreement”) in the city of Magnolia, Texas. In 2021, our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. acquired approximately 19.5 acres of partially developed land near Houston, Texas which was used to develop a community named Alset Villas (“Alset Villas”). Alset EHome was in the process of developing the 63 lots at Alset Villas in 2023. The selling price of these lots is anticipated to equal approximately $3.3 million. The closing of the transactions described above depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions, and is expected to take place during the second quarter of 2024. In addition, the Company will be entitled to receive certain reimbursements in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2025.

 

The management believes that the available cash in bank accounts and favorable cash revenue from real estate projects are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities was $1,509,247 in the first three months of 2024, as compared to net cash used operating activities of $3,289,083 in the same period of 2023. Capitalization of real estate expenses was the main reason for the cash used in operating activities in 2023. Prepayment of expenses and investment in trading securities were the main reason for the cash used in 2024

 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

 

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,758,503 in the first three months of 2024, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $671,484 in the same period of 2023. In the three months ended March 31, 2024 we invested $646,785 in marketable securities, issued $1,144,317 in loans to related parties and received $34,671 from repayment of related party notes receivable. In the three months ended March 31, 2023 we invested $412,500 in marketable securities, issued $1,521,368 in loans to related parties and received $2,613,629 from repayment of related party notes receivable.

 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

 

Net cash used in financing activities was $240,182 in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided of $3,433,921 in the three months ended March 31, 2023. In the first three months of 2024 the Company borrowed $119,621 from a third part loan and repaid $359,803 of note payable. The cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of 2023 is caused by the proceeds from stock issuance of $3,433,921.

 

Impact of Inflation

 

We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

 

Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates

 

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the intercompany loans (under ASC 830), which mostly consist of loans from Singapore to the United States and which were approximately $23 million and $23 million on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are the reason for the significant fluctuation of foreign currency transaction Gain or Loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. Because the intercompany loan balances between Singapore and United States will remain at approximately $23 million over the next year, we expect this fluctuation of foreign exchange rates to still significantly impact the results of operations in 2024, especially given that the foreign exchange rate may and is expected to be volatile. If the amount of intercompany loan is lowered in the future, the effect will also be reduced. However, at this moment, we do not expect to repay the intercompany loans in the short term.

 

Emerging Growth Company Status

 

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption.

 

Seasonality

 

The real estate business is subject to seasonal shifts in costs as certain work is more likely to be performed at certain times of the year. This may impact the expenses of our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. from time to time. In addition, should we commence building homes, we are likely to experience periodic spikes in sales as we commence the sales process at a particular location.

 

                                                                   11
