CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING

 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements relate to anticipated future events, future results of operations and or future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by their use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “ought to,” “plan,” “possible,” “potentially,” “predicts,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” negatives of such terms or other similar terms. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements relating to:

 

     ●    our goals and strategies;

 

     ●    our future business development, results of operations and financial condition;

 

     ●    our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and our need for additional financing;

 

     ●    our estimates regarding the market opportunity for our services;

 

     ●    the impact of government laws and regulations;

 

     ●    our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel;

 

     ●    our failure to comply with regulatory guidelines;

 

     ●    uncertainty in industry demand;

 

     ●    general economic conditions and market conditions in the financial services industry;

 

     ●    future sales of large blocks or our securities, which may adversely impact our share price; and

 

     ●    depth of the trading market in our securities.

 

The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

You should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward- looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are of a normal recurring nature and are necessary to fairly present the financial statements for the interim periods. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.GAAP”) and have been prepared in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial statements. Results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of GDC and its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

 

The preparation of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the useful lives of intangible assets and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, collectability of receivables, fair value of convertible notes, discount rate used to measure present value of lease liabilities and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

 

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

 

The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The PRC subsidiaries of the Company conduct their businesses in the local currency, Renminbi (RMB), as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board at the end of the period. The statements of operations accounts are translated at the average translation rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.

 

Translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to $213,006 and $73,279 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets amounts, with the exception of shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were translated at 7.22 RMB and 7.10 RMB to $1.00, respectively. The shareholders’ equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations accounts for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 were 7.19 RMB and 7.08 RMB to $1.00, respectively. Unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods, therefore, amounts reported on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 

The PRC government imposes significant exchange restrictions on fund transfers out of the PRC that are not related to business operations. These restrictions have not had a material impact on the Company because it has not engaged in any significant transactions that are subject to the restrictions.

Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits placed with commercial banks or other financial institutions and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less. All cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use.

 

Loan Receivable

 

Loan receivable is the amounts lent to a third party with the interest rate of 5% per annual. Since the loan will be due within one year, the Company classified the loan as current assets under the loan receivable account on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. The interest accrued during the reporting period was recorded as interest income on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

Prepaid and other current assets

 

Prepaid and other current assets are advances paid to outside vendors for services purchases. The Company has legally binding contracts with its vendors, which require any outstanding prepayments to be returned to the Company when the contract ends.

 

Convertible Notes Receivable

 

The Company evaluated the terms of the DigiTrax Convertible Notes and the Liquid Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 12) according to ASC 320 “Investments — Debt Securities” and concluded that the convertible notes should be classified as an available-for-sale security and measured at fair value. To evaluate the fair value of the available-for-sale security, the Company used the Binominal Tree Pricing Model. The fair value changes of the convertible notes receivable were recorded as other comprehensive income.

Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method after consideration of the estimated useful lives of the assets and estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives and residual value are as follows:

 

                                                                                                      Useful Life      Estimated     

                                                                                                                        Residual

                                                                                                                         Value

Office equipment and furnishing                                                                         5 years                    5%

 

The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred, while additions, renewals and betterments, which are expected to extend the useful life of assets, are capitalized. The Company also re-evaluates the periods of depreciation to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets represent software that are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Research and development costs associated with internally developed patents are expensed when incurred. Amortization expense is recognized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The software has finite useful lives and is amortized using a straight-line method that reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are to be consumed. The Company amortizes the cost of software, over their useful life using the straight-line method. The Company also re-evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances revised estimates of useful lives. The estimated useful life is as follows:

 

                                                                                                                           Useful Life

Software                                                                                                                     5 years

Lease

 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases as if there was an acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease. All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. The Company has no significant finance leases.

 

The Company recognizes lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet for leases. Operating lease right- of-use assets (the “ROU”) are disclosed as non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Current maturities of operating lease liabilities are classified as operating lease liabilities - current, and operating lease liabilities that will be due in more than one year are disclosed as non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of future lease payments at lease commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and the initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. As the interest rates implicit in most of the leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at lease commencement to determine the present value of the future lease payments. Operating lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

 

Most leases have initial terms ranging from 1.1 to 5.4 years. The Company’s lease agreements did not include non-lease components. Lease expense for fixed lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restricted covenants.

 

The Company evaluates the carrying value of ROU assets if there are indicators of impairment and reviews the recoverability of the related asset group.

 

The Company reassesses of a contract is or contains a leasing arrangement and re-measures ROU assets and liabilities upon modification of the contract. The Company will derecognize ROU assets and liabilities, with difference recognized in the income statement on the contract termination.

 

Impairment for Long-lived Assets

 

Long-lived assets, including equipment, intangible assets and ROU assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable individually or as a group at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets (or group of assets) based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets (or group of assets) are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or group of assets) plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset (or group of assets), if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset (or group of assets). If an impairment is identified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset (or group of assets) to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. The carrying amount of the asset (or the long-lived assets in the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts) is reduced to the extent not lower than the fair value of the asset. The adjusted carrying amounts after an impairment charge represent the new cost basis and is depreciated over their remaining useful lives.

 

Fair value measurement

 

The accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. The Company considers the carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, loan receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, other payables and accrued liabilities to approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature.

 

13

 

 

The accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:

 

     ●    Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

           markets.

 

     ●    Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and

           inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of

           the financial

           instruments.

 

     ●    Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values of cash, other receivables, loan receivable, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Fair value of convertible notes receivable have been discussed in Note 20.

  

Revenue recognition

 

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. This did not result in an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of this new guidance as the Company’s revenue, other than retainage revenues, was recognized based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. However, the impact of the Company’s retainage revenue was not material as of the date of adoption, and as a result, did not result in an adjustment.

 

The core principle underlying the revenue recognition ASC 606 is that the Company will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer.

 

The Company’s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time.

 

The ASC 606 requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASC 606 under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition except its retainage revenues.

 

An entity will also be required to determine if it controls the goods or services prior to the transfer to the customer in order to determine if it should account for the arrangement as a principal or agent. Principal arrangements, where the entity controls the goods or services provided, will result in the recognition of the gross amount of consideration expected in the exchange. Agent arrangements, where the entity simply arranges but does not control the goods or services being transferred to the customer, will result in the recognition of the net amount the entity is entitled to retain in the exchange.

 

The Company, as a principal, provides services to clients under separate contracts, generating revenue. The pricing terms specified in the contracts are fixed. An obligation to perform is identified in contracts with clients. Revenue is recognized over the period in which the services are earned.

 

Payments received prior to the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are met, are recorded as customer deposits.

 

The Company did not have any revenue streams from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP for income taxes. The charge for taxation is based on the results for the fiscal year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

 

Deferred taxes is accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.

 

An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. The Company incurred no such penalties and interest for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Interest

 

Interest income is mainly generated from bank deposits and other interest earning financial assets and is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.

 

Net Loss per Common Stock

 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average common stocks outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stocks were exercised and converted into common stocks. 

 

In May 2023 and November 2023 in connection with the placement agency agreements (see Note 16), the Company issued and sold pre-funded warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 844,351 and 1,876,103 shares of common stock, at the exercise price of $8.35 and $3.019 per share, of which $8.349 and $3.018 was pre-funded and paid to the Company upon issuance of the pre-funded warrants, respectively. The remaining exercise price of the pre-funded warrants is $0.001 per share. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable by the holders at any time and do not expire. On November 1, 2023, in connection with the Warrant Exchange Agreements (see Note 16), the holders of May 2023 Unregistered Warrants (as defined in Note 16) surrendered the May 2023 Unregistered Warrants, and the Company cancelled the May 2023 Unregistered Warrants and issued to these holders pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 577,260 shares of the Company’s common stock with no consideration.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, 567,691 pre-funded warrants representing 567,691 shares of the Company’s common stock were exercised for $654. The remaining pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable after issuance and do not expire. As the remaining shares underlying the pre-funded warrants are issuable for nominal consideration of $0.001 per share, 922,072 in common stocks underlying the unexercised pre-funded warrants were considered outstanding for purposes of the calculation of loss per share as of March 31, 2024.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, 7,309,181 and 4,539,674 of outstanding warrants (excluding the Pre-funded Warrants and Exchange Warrants) which are equivalent to convertible of 3,080,017 and 151,323 common stocks were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation due to their antidilutive effect.

Comprehensive Loss

 

Comprehensive loss is defined as the changes in equity of the Company during a year from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Accumulated other comprehensive income of the Company includes the foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or loss on available-for-sale investments.

 

Reclassification

 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net loss or and financial position.

 

Recently Accounting Pronouncements

 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 since January 1, 2024.

 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”, which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2022-03 since January 1, 2024.

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company will begin providing the enhanced reportable segment financial disclosures effective with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which establishes accounting guidance for crypto assets meeting certain criteria. Bitcoin meets this criteria. The amendments require crypto assets meeting the criteria to be recognized at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. Upon adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment is made to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period of adoption. ASU 2023-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2022-08 since January 1, 2024.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company’s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.

 

The Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, unaudited condensed interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

  

Note 3 – Variable Interest Entity

 

Yuanma

 

On June 21, 2022, Makesi WFOE entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Yuanma and its shareholders. The significant terms of these contractual arrangements are summarized in “Note 1 - Nature of business and organization” above. As a result, the Company classified Yuanma as VIE.

 

On June 26, 2023, GDC entered into a share purchase agreement with a buyer unaffiliated with the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interest in TMSR HK, which hold 100% of the equity interests in Makesi WFOE. The purchase price for the transaction contemplated by the Agreement was $100,000. The sale of TMSR HK included the sale of Makesi WFOE and Yuanma, which has any material impact on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Highlight Media

 

On September 16, 2022, Makesi WFOE entered into contractual arrangements with Highlight Media and its shareholders. The significant terms of these contractual arrangements are summarized in “Note 1 - Nature of business and organization” above. As a result, the Company classifies Highlight Media as VIE.

 

On February 27, 2023, Highlight WFOE entered into a series of assignment agreements with Makesi WFOE, Highlight Media and Highlight Shareholders, pursuant to which Makesi WFOE assign all its rights and obligations under the VIE agreements to Highlight WFOE. The VIE agreements and the assignment agreements granted Highlight WFOE with the power, rights and obligations equivalent in all material respects to those it would possess as the sole equity holder of Highlight Media, including absolute rights to control the management, operations, assets, property and revenue of Highlight Media. The assignment did not have any impact on Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

On September 26, 2023, Highlight WFOE entered into a termination agreement with Highlight Media and the shareholders of Highlight Media to terminate the VIE Agreements and sell the interest in the VIE Agreements for a purchase price of $100,000. As a result of such termination, the Company no longer treats Highlight Media as a consolidated affiliated entity or consolidates the financial results and balance sheet of Highlight Media in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

A VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Highlight WFOE is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media and Makesi WFOE is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary of Yuanma because Highlight WFOE and Makesi WFOE have both of the following characteristics:

 

     (1)  The power to direct activities at Highlight Media and Yuanma that most significantly impact such entity’s economic

           performance,

           and

 

     (2)  The obligation to absorb losses of, and the right to receive benefits from Highlight Media and Yuanma that could potentially

           be significant to such

           entity.

 

Accordingly, the accounts of Highlight Media and Yuanma are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements pursuant to ASC 810-10, Consolidation. In addition, Yuanma’s financial positions and results of operations were included in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements prior to June 26, 2023 and Highlight Media’s financial positions and results of operations were included in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements prior to September 26, 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company did not have any VIE operations. The operations results from VIE operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been reflected in discontinued operations as disclosed in Note 19.

 

Note 4 – Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash at banks represents cash balances maintained at commercial banks. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any cash equivalents. The Company maintains bank accounts in the United States and institutions in PRC.

 

                                                                                                         March 31,     December 31,  

                                                                                                            2024           2023

Note 14 – Taxes

 

Income tax

 

United States

 

GDC was organized in the state of Delaware in April 2015. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, GDC’s net operating loss carry forward for United States income taxes was approximately $7.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The net operating loss carry forwards are available to reduce future years’ taxable income through year 2039. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company’s operating history and continued losses in the United States. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to zero. Management reviews this valuation allowance periodically and makes changes accordingly.

 

On December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“The 2017 Tax Act”) was enacted in the United States. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 34% to 21%. The 2017 Tax Act imposed a global intangible low-taxed income tax (“GILTI”), which is a new tax on certain off-shore earnings at an effective rate of 10.5% for tax years beginning after March 31, 2017 (increasing to 13.125% for tax years beginning after March 31, 2025) with a partial offset for foreign tax credits. The Company determined that there is no impact of GILTI for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, which the Company believes that it will be imposed a minimum tax rate of 10.5% and to the extent foreign tax credits are available to reduce its US corporate tax, which may result in no additional US federal income tax being due.

 

British Virgin Islands

 

Citi Profit BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and are not subject to tax on income or capital gains under current British Virgin Islands law. In addition, upon payments of dividends by these entities to their shareholders, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax will be imposed.

 

Hong Kong

 

TMSR HK and Highlight HK are incorporated in Hong Kong and are subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax on the taxable income as reported in its statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with relevant Hong Kong tax laws. TMSR and Highlight HK are subject to Hong Kong profit tax at a rate of 8.25% for assessable profits on the first HK$2 million and 16.5% for any assessable profits in excess of HK$2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company did not make any provisions for Hong Kong profit tax as there were no assessable profits derived from or earned in Hong Kong since inception. Under Hong Kong tax law, TMSR HK is exempted from income tax on its foreign-derived income and there are no withholding taxes in Hong Kong on remittance of dividends.

Value added tax

 

Enterprises or individuals who sell commodities, provide services, engage in repair and maintenance or import and export goods in the PRC are subject to a value added tax (the “VAT”) in accordance with PRC laws. The VAT standard rates changed to 6% to 13% of the gross sales prices starting in April 2019. A credit is available whereby VAT paid on the purchases of services can be used to offset the VAT due on sales of the finished products and services.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there is no balance of the value added tax payable. 

 

Note 15 – Concentration of Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $62,435 and $4,458,402 in excess of the FDIC insured limit, respectively.

Note 16 – Equity

 

Statutory Reserves and Restricted Net Assets

 

In accordance with the PRC Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment, an enterprise established in the PRC with foreign investment is required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve fund, an enterprise expansion fund, a staff welfare fund and a bonus fund, all of which are appropriated from net profit as reported in its PRC statutory accounts. A foreign invested enterprise is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profits to a general reserve fund until such fund has reached 50% of its respective registered capital. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus funds are at the discretion of the board of directors for the foreign invested enterprises. For other subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC, the general reserve fund was appropriated based on 10% of net profits as reported in each subsidiary’s PRC statutory accounts. General reserve and statutory surplus funds are restricted to set-off against losses, expansion of production and operation and increasing registered capital of the respective company. Staff welfare and bonus fund and statutory public welfare funds are restricted to capital expenditures for the collective welfare of employees. The reserves are not allowed to be transferred to the Company in terms of cash dividends, loans or advances, nor are they allowed for distribution except under liquidation. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are no balance of the PRC statutory reserve funds.

 

In addition, under PRC laws and regulations, the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer their net assets to the Company in the form of dividend payments, loans or advances. Amounts of net assets restricted include paid up capital and statutory reserve funds of the Company’s PRC totaling $397,243 and $1,083,267 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Furthermore, cash transfers from the Company’s PRC subsidiaries to the Company’s subsidiaries outside of the PRC are subject to the PRC government control of currency conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the Company’s PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to the Company, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations.

Warrants and Options

 

On July 29, 2015, the Company sold 10,000,000 units at a purchase price of $5.00 per unit (“Public Units”) in its initial public offering (the “IPO”). Each Public Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one warrant (the “Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrants entitled the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.88 per half share ($5.75 per whole share). Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable on 30 days after the consummation of its initial Business Combination with China Sunlong on February 6, 2018. The Public Warrants expired on February 5, 2023.

 

The sponsor of the Company purchased, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO on July 29, 2015, 500,000 units (“Private Units”) at $5.00 per unit in a private placement for an aggregate price of $2,500,000. Each Private Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one warrant (the “Private Warrants”). Each Private Unit purchased is substantially identical to the units sold in the IPO. Therefore, the 500,000 Private Warrants included in the Private Units became exercisable on February 6, 2018 and expired on February 5, 2023.

The Option became exercisable until closing the initial Business Combination on February 6, 2018 and expired on February 5, 2023.

Pursuant to the February 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to hold a meeting of our shareholders not later than April 29, 2021 to seek such approval as may be required from our shareholders (the “Stockholder Approval”), in accordance with applicable law, the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes with respect to the issuance of the securities in the Offering, including the Warrants sold in the Private Placement, so that the issuance by us of shares of common stock in excess of the 231,802 shares (19.99% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of February 17, 2021, the date prior to entering into the February 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement) in the aggregate (the “Issuable Maximum”), will be in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(a) and 5635(d) as described herein, and investors in the Offering will be able to exercise the Warrants prior to six months after the closing of the Offering.

In the RD Offering, each Pre-funded Warrant is exercisable for one share of our common stock, with an exercise price equal to $0.001 per share, at any time that the Pre-funded Warrant is outstanding. The Pre-funded Warrants will be exercisable immediately after issuance and will expire five (5) years from the date of issuance. The holder of a Pre-funded Warrant will not be deemed a holder of our underlying common stock until the Pre-funded Warrant is exercised.

The fair value changes of these notes were recorded as other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations at each reporting date.  As a result of the unobservable inputs, the available-for-sale security was classified as Level 3 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

There were no transfers among the three hierarchies for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Note 21 – Subsequent events

 

On April 26, 2024, the Company appointed Mr. Lei Zhang as a director, chair of the Compensation Committee, and member of the Audit Committee and Nominating Committee and Mr. Yun Zhang as a director, chair of the Nominating Committee, and member of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee of the Company, each of Mr. Lei Zhang and Mr. Yun Zhang will receive $5,000 annual compensation, effective April 26, 2024.

 

On May 13, 2024, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, based on the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock was below $1.00 for the last 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer complies with the minimum bid price requirement (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 11, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.

 

If the Company does not regain compliance by November 11, 2024, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would be required, among other things, to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares, as well as all other standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal Nasdaq’s determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing.

 

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of the common stock and consider its available options to resolve the noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market’s continued listing requirements or that Nasdaq will grant the Company a further extension of time to regain compliance, if applicable.

All monetary figures are presented in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

 

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

 

Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.

Key Factors that Affect Operating Results

 

Competition

 

E-commerce and live streaming is a competitive industry. Our competition varies and includes content creators on TikTok and other social media platform. Each of these competitors competes with us based on quality of content, activeness and responsiveness on the social placement, product selection, product quality, customer service, price, store format, location, or a combination of these factors. Some of these competitors may have been in business longer, may have more experience, or may have greater financial or marketing resources than us. As competition intensifies, our results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and decrease in market share.

 

Retention of Key Management Team Members

 

Our management team comprises executives with extensive experience in technology and content creation. The management team has led us to take leaps in deploying AI technology in live-steaming, e-commerce, gaming and other sectors. The loss of any of our key executive team member might affect our business and our result of operation.

 

Our Ability to Grow Market Presence and Penetrate New Markets

 

We are still in an early development stage. We intend to expand our presence on social media to increase the market presence. If we cannot grow market presence and penetrate new markets in an effective and cost-efficient way, our results of operation will be negatively impacted.

 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

 

The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our business or results of operation for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the general economy and our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These uncertainties may impede our ability to conduct our operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.

Operating Expenses

 

The Company’s operating expenses include selling and marketing (“S&M”) expenses, general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, research and development (“R&D”) expenses. S&M expenses increased to approximately $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the Company increased inputs on digital human and e-commerce live streaming marketing and advertising to improve its brand reputation, attract a large following on social media. G&A expenses increased by approximately $1.8 million from $4,617 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the combined impact of (i) the expansion of our administrative associated personnel cost, (ii) increase in operating and lease expenses for offices, (iii) increase in the professional service fee and (iv) amortization of intangible assets. R&D expenses increased to $217,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the Company increased inputs on research and development about our artificial intelligence based digital human application, to create unconventional digital characters and customize digital humans to support the clients’ marketing efforts.

The Company’s other income increased by approximately $22 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the interest income earned from the loan to a third party.

 

Loss from Continuing Operations

 

As a result of the foregoing, loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $4.1 million, an increase of approximately 89,948.5%, from loss from continuing operations of $4,617 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Net Loss

 

The Company’s net loss increased by approximately $4.1 million, or 19,410.7%, to approximately $4.2 million net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $21,309 net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the combined impact of (i) the expansion of our administrative associated personnel cost, (ii) increase in operating and lease expenses for offices and (iii) increase in researching and development about our artificial intelligence based digital human application.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

The Company prepares its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amounts the Company reports as assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Company’s actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has identified the following key accounting estimates:

 

Convertible Notes Receivable

 

The Company evaluated the terms of the DigiTrax Convertible Notes and the Liquid Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 12 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements) according to ASC 320 “Investments — Debt Securities” and concluded that the convertible notes should be classified as an available-for-sale security and measured at fair value. To evaluate the fair value of the available-for-sale security, the Company used the valuation methodology of income approach, which is determined by the future cash flow forecast. The fair value changes of these notes were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended as of the reporting period.

Impairment of long-lived assets

 

The Company’s determination of whether or not an indication of impairment exists at the cash generating unit level requires significant management judgment pertaining to intangible assets, including a copyright of a broadcast game (the “Tribal Light”) and 55 digital humans, which are used for online living-stream, as well as the operating Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, including the offices of the Company. Management considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that the Company’s intangible assets and ROU assets are impaired.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 since January 1, 2024.

 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”, which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2022-03 since January 1, 2024.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company’s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company will begin providing the enhanced reportable segment financial disclosures effective with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which establishes accounting guidance for crypto assets meeting certain criteria. Bitcoin meets this criteria. The amendments require crypto assets meeting the criteria to be recognized at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. Upon adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment is made to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period of adoption. ASU 2023-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated and concluded that there’s no impact of the new guidance on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2022-08 since January 1, 2024.

 

We do not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The Company has funded working capital and other capital requirements primarily by equity contributions. Cash is required to repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses and other operating expenses. As of March 31, 2024, our net working capital was approximately $5.6 million.

 

We believe that current levels of cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to be issued. However, it may need additional cash resources in the future if it experiences changed business conditions or other developments, and may also need additional cash resources in the future if it wishes to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. If it is determined that the cash requirements exceed the Company’s amounts of cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain additional credit facility.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Credit Risk

 

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks for the Company’s business.

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. Cash held at major financial institutions located in the PRC are not insured by the government. While we believe that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness.

 

Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers, thereby exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company manages credit risk through in-house research and analysis of the Chinese economy and the underlying obligors and transaction structures. To minimize credit risk, the Company normally require prepayment from the customers prior to begin production or delivery products. The Company identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography and customer type. This information is monitored regularly by management.

 

In measuring the credit risk of our sales to our customers, the Company mainly reflects the “probability of default” by the customer on its contractual obligations and considers the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer and its likely future development.

 

Liquidity Risk

 

The Company is also exposed to liquidity risk which is risk that it is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs. Liquidity risk is controlled by the application of financial position analysis and monitoring procedures. When necessary, the Company will turn to other financial institutions and the owners to obtain short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage.

 

Inflation Risk

 

The Company is also exposed to inflation risk. Inflationary factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with such increased costs.

 

Foreign Currency Risk

 

A majority of the Company’s operating activities and a significant portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB, which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the Peoples’ Bank of China (“PBOC”) or other authorized financial institutions at exchange rates quoted by PBOC. Approval of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers’ invoices and signed contracts. The value of RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report.

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
