High Wire Networks, Inc.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements

March 31, 2024

 

1.        Organization

 

HWN, Inc., (d/b/a High Wire Network Solutions, Inc.) (“HWN” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 20, 2017. The Company is a global provider of managed cybersecurity, managed networks, and tech enabled professional services delivered exclusively through a channel sales model. The Company’s Overwatch managed security platform-as-a-service offers organizations end-to-end protection for networks, data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing technology segment.

 

HWN and JTM Electrical Contractors, Inc. (“JTM”), an Illinois Corporation, entered into an operating agreement through which High Wire owned 50% of JTM.

 

On June 16, 2021, the Company completed a merger with Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. On January 7, 2022, Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. legally changed its name to High Wire Networks, Inc. (“High Wire” or, collectively with HWN, “the Company”). The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. At the time of the reverse merger, High Wire’s subsidiaries included ADEX Corporation, ADEX Puerto Rico LLC, ADEX Canada, ADEX Towers, Inc. and ADEX Telecom, Inc. (collectively “ADEX” or the “ADEX Entities”), AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC (“AWS PR”), and Tropical Communications, Inc. (“Tropical”). For accounting purposes, HWN is the surviving entity.

 

High Wire was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 22, 2007 to acquire and commercially exploit various new energy related technologies through licenses and purchases. On December 8, 2008, High Wire reincorporated in the province of British Columbia, Canada.

 

On November 4, 2021, the Company closed on its acquisition of Secure Voice Corp (“SVC”). The closing of the acquisition was facilitated by a senior secured promissory note.

 

On February 15, 2022, HWN sold its 50% interest in JTM, which qualified for discontinued operations treatment.

 

On March 6, 2023, HWN divested the ADEX Entities. The divestiture of the ADEX Entities qualified for discontinued operations treatment (refer to Note 17, Discontinued Operations, for additional detail).

 

On July 31, 2023, the Company paused the operations of its AWS PR subsidiary and sold off certain assets.

 

On August 4, 2023, the Company formed a new entity – incorporated as Overwatch Cyberlab, Inc. (“OCL”) – which is 80% owned by the Company and 20% owned by John Peterson.

 

On November 3, 2023, the Company paused the operations of its Tropical subsidiary.

 

The Company’s AWS PR and Tropical subsidiaries are professional, multi-service line, telecommunications infrastructure companies that provide outsourced services to the wireless and wireline industry. The Company’s SVC subsidiary is a wholesale network services provider with network footprint and licenses in the Northeast and Southeast United States as well as Texas. This network carries VoIP and other traffic for other service providers. OCL has not begun to generate revenue as of March 31, 2024.

 

2.        Significant Accounting Policies

   

Condensed Financial Statements

 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a recurring nature considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods shown.

 

6

 

 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

 

Basis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation

 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as High Wire and its subsidiaries, AWS PR, Tropical, SVC, and OCL. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned.

 

All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company records unbilled receivables for services performed but not billed. Management reviews a customer’s credit history before extending credit. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period, and changes are recorded in the period in which they become known. Management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable each period. This review considers the aging of account balances, historical bad debt experience, and changes in customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, customer payment activity and other relevant factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimate made by management may also change. The allowance for doubtful accounts at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $291,298 and $311,610, respectively.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:

 

Computers and office equipment                                       3-7 years straight-line basis

Vehicles                                                             3-5 years straight-line basis

Leasehold improvements                                               5 years straight-line basis

Software                                                             5 years straight-line basis

Machinery and equipment                                              5 years straight-line basis

Goodwill

 

The Company has two reporting units, HWN and SVC, and tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually on December 31 and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the Company’s expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and the Company’s consolidated financial results.

  

The Company tests goodwill by estimating fair value using a Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) model. The key assumptions used in the DCF model to determine the highest and best use of estimated future cash flows include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value and an estimate of a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows to their present value. There were no impairment charges during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

  

Intangible Assets

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, definite-lived intangible assets consisted of tradenames and customer relationships which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. 

 

The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. The Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives.

 

For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. The Company measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. There were no impairment charges during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Long-lived Assets

 

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment”, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. There were no impairment charges during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

 

8

 

 

The Company conducts business, and files federal and state income, franchise or net worth, tax returns in United States, in various states within the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company determines its filing obligations in a jurisdiction in accordance with existing statutory and case law. The Company may be subject to a reassessment of federal and provincial income taxes by Canadian tax authorities for a period of three years from the date of the original notice of assessment in respect of any particular taxation year. For Canadian and U.S. income tax returns, the open taxation years range from 2020 to 2023. In certain circumstances, the U.S. federal statute of limitations can reach beyond the standard three year period. U.S. state statutes of limitations for income tax assessment vary from state to state. Tax authorities of the U.S. have not audited any of the Company’s, or its subsidiaries’, income tax returns for the open taxation years noted above.

   

Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, and in particular, any valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability. The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, which should reduce taxable income in future periods. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income.

 

The Company follows the guidance set forth within ASC 740, “Income Taxes” which prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, recognition and classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Penalties and interest, if incurred, would be recorded as a component of current income tax expense.

 

Prior to 2021, the Company had elected to be treated as a Subchapter S Corporation for income tax purposes, and as such recognized no income tax liability or benefit.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify separate performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations, and 5) recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Contract Types

 

The Company’s contracts fall under two main types: 1) fixed-price and 2) time-and-materials. Fixed-price contracts are based on purchase order line items that are billed on individual invoices as the project progresses and milestones are reached. Time-and-materials contracts include employees working on an as needed basis at customer locations and materials costs incurred by those employees.

 

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues come from customers with whom the Company has a master service agreement (“MSA”). These MSA’s generally contain customer specific service requirements.

  

Performance Obligations

 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in the new revenue standard. The contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For the Company’s different revenue service types, the performance obligation is satisfied at different times. For professional services revenue, the performance obligation is met when the work is performed. In certain cases, this may be each day or each week, depending on the customer. For construction services, the performance obligation is met when the work is completed and the customer has approved the work.

The Company also disaggregates its revenue by operating segment and geographic location (refer to Note 15, Segment Disclosures, for additional information).

 

Contract Assets and Liabilities

 

Contract assets would include costs and services incurred on contracts with open performance obligations. These amounts would be included in contract assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any contract assets.

  

Contract liabilities include payment received for incomplete performance obligations and are included in contract liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract liabilities totaled $384,253 and $382,576, respectively.

  

Cost of Revenues

 

Cost of revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under the Company’s contracts, including costs for direct labor provided by employees, services by independent subcontractors, operation of capital equipment, direct materials, insurance claims and other direct costs. 

 

Research and Development Costs

 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

 

Stock-based Compensation

 

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the grant date fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718, at either the grant date fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07. In accordance with ASU 2016-09, the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

 

10

 

 

The Company uses certain pricing models to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

 

(Loss) Income per Share

 

The Company computes (loss) income per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the (loss) income available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the conversion of convertible debentures or preferred stock and the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had 159,029,949 and 145,710,627 common stock equivalents outstanding. As of March 31, 2023, 19,849,588 of the common stock equivalents were dilutive.

 

Leases

 

ASC 842, “Leases” requires recognition of leases on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements contain options to renew and options to terminate the leases early. The lease term used to calculate ROU assets and lease liabilities only includes renewal and termination options that are deemed reasonably certain to be exercised.

  

The Company recognized lease liabilities, with corresponding ROU assets, based on the present value of unpaid lease payments for existing operating leases longer than twelve months as of January 1, 2019. The ROU assets were adjusted per ASC 842 transition guidance for existing lease-related balances of accrued and prepaid rent, unamortized lease incentives provided by lessors, and restructuring liabilities, Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for all property leases for the purposes of calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities.

  

Going Concern Assessment

 

Management assesses going concern uncertainty in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to determine whether there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital, including available borrowings on loans, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued or available to be issued, which is referred to as the “look-forward period”, as defined in GAAP. As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to management, management will consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, estimates and will make certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, its ability to delay or curtail expenditures or programs and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, management makes certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent it deems probable those implementations can be achieved and management has the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period.

While the Company had operating income during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company generated an operating loss in the three months ended March 31, 2023, and High Wire has historically generated operating losses since its inception and has relied on cash on hand, sales of securities, external bank lines of credit, and issuance of third-party and related party debt to support cash flow from operations. As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had operating income of $347,664, cash flows used in continuing operations of $1,566,722, and a working capital deficit of $10,695,470. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which the Company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

Management believes that based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable, its forecasts of operations for one year from the date of the filing of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q indicate improved operations and the Company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern. The Company has contingency plans to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays should operations not improve in the look forward period. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of management to raise additional equity capital through private and public offerings of its common stock, and the attainment of profitable operations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

  

Management requires additional funds over the next twelve months to fully implement its business plan. Management is currently seeking additional financing through the sale of equity and from borrowings from private lenders to cover its operating expenditures. There can be no certainty that these sources will provide the additional funds required for the next twelve months. 

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

In November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company’s annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures.  

 

Any other new accounting pronouncements recently issued, but not yet effective, have been reviewed and determined to be not applicable or were related to technical amendments or codification. As a result, the adoption of such new accounting pronouncements, when effective, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash balances with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be withdrawn upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk. As of March 31, 2024, there were no cash balances in excess of provided insurance.

 

The Company provides credit to customers on an uncollateralized basis after evaluating client creditworthiness. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 49% of consolidated revenues for the period. In addition, amounts due from this customer represented 55% of trade accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 36%, and 23%, respectively, of consolidated revenues for the period. In addition, amounts due from these customers represented 26%, and 20%, respectively, of trade accounts receivable as of March 31, 2023.

 

The Company’s customers are primarily located within the domestic United States of America and Puerto Rico. Revenues generated within the domestic United States of America accounted for approximately 100% and 98% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues generated from customers in Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 0% and 2% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company measures and discloses the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy prescribed by US generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy has three levels, which are based on reliable available inputs of observable data. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The three-level hierarchy is defined as follows:

 

Level 1 – quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;

 

Level 2 – quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

 

Level 3 – fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

 

Financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, loans payable and convertible debentures. Warrant liabilities are determined based on “Level 3” inputs, which are significant and unobservable and have the lowest priority. There were no transfers into or out of “Level 3” during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.

   

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:

 (1)  The Company estimated the fair value of these warrant liabilities using either the Black-Scholes model or the price of the

       Company’s common

       stock.

 

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Refer to Note 9, Warrant Liabilities, for additional information.

Warrant Liabilities

 

The Company accounts for its liability-classified warrants in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and all warrant liabilities are reflected as liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value to value its warrant liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, the Company’s policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads, relying first on observable data from active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC 820 based on the hierarchical framework associated with the three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had warrant liabilities of $1,031,222 and $833,615.

 

Sequencing Policy

 

Under ASC 815-40-35, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy whereby, in the event that reclassification of contracts from equity to assets or liabilities is necessary pursuant to ASC 815 due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient authorized shares as a result of certain securities with a potentially indeterminable number of shares, shares will be allocated on the basis of the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments, with the earliest grants receiving the first allocation of shares. Pursuant to ASC 815, issuance of securities to the Company’s employees or directors are not subject to the sequencing policy.

The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the warrant liabilities as their fair values were determined by using either the Black-Scholes model based on various assumptions or the price of the Company’s common stock.

 

Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations:

 

                                                                          Expected       Risk-free        Expected      Expected life

13.       Leases

 

The Company leases certain office space and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable lives of operating lease assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. The Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities.

 

The following table sets forth the operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

14.       Commitments and Contingencies

 

Leases

 

The Company leases its principal offices under a lease that expires in 2026. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and immaterial leases are not recorded on the balance sheet (refer to Note 13, Leases, for amounts expensed during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023).

 

Legal proceedings

 

In the normal course of business or otherwise, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.

 

15.       Segment Disclosures

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had three operating segments including:

 

          ●    Technology, which is comprised of AWS PR, Tropical, OCL, and HWN.

 

          ●    SVC, which consists of the Company’s SVC subsidiary.

                

          ●    Corporate, which consists of the rest of the Company’s operations.

 

Factors used to identify the Company’s reportable segments include the organizational structure of the Company and the financial information available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s operating segments have been broken out based on similar economic and other qualitative criteria. The Company operates the SVC and Corporate reporting segments in one geographical area (the United States) and the AWS PR/ Tropical/OCL/HWN operating segment in two geographical areas (the United States and Puerto Rico).

Description of Business

 

Business Overview

 

HWN, Inc., (d/b/a High Wire Network Solutions, Inc.) (“HWN”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 20, 2017. HWN is a global provider of managed cybersecurity, managed networks, and tech enabled professional services delivered exclusively through a channel sales model. Our Overwatch managed security platform-as-a-service offers organizations end-to-end protection for networks, data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing technology segment. HWN has continuously operated under the High Wire Networks brand for 23 years.

 

HWN and JTM Electrical Contractors, Inc. (“JTM”), an Illinois Corporation, entered into an operating agreement through which High Wire owned 50% of JTM. On February 15, 2022, HWN sold its 50% interest in JTM.

  

On June 16, 2021, we completed a merger with Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. On January 7, 2022, Spectrum Global Solutions, Inc. legally changed its name to High Wire Networks, Inc. (“High Wire”). The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger. At the time of the reverse merger, High Wire’s subsidiaries included ADEX Corporation, ADEX Puerto Rico LLC, ADEX Canada, ADEX Towers, Inc. and ADEX Telecom, Inc. (collectively “ADEX” or the “ADEX Entities”), AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC (“AWS PR”), and Tropical Communications, Inc. (“Tropical”). For accounting purposes, HWN is the surviving entity. On March 6, 2023, HWN divested the ADEX Entities. On July 31, 2023, HWN paused the operations of its AWS PR subsidiary. On November 3, 2023, HWN paused the operations of its Tropical subsidiary.

 

On November 4, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of Secure Voice Corp (“SVC”). The closing of the acquisition was facilitated by a senior secured promissory note which has been repaid.

 

On August 4, 2023, we formed a new entity – incorporated as Overwatch Cyberlab, Inc. (“OCL”) – which is 80% owned by our company and 20% owned by John Peterson.

Revenues

 

Our revenue decreased from $10,165,171 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $7,650,981 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in revenue of $2,514,190 is offset by an improvement in gross profit (revenue minus cost of revenue) of $2,066,739. The improvement in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 14.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 45.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily related to a more efficient project management delivery effort, improved project profitability during the bid quoting process, as well as suspension of unprofitable business segments (Tropical and AWS PR) in the third quarter of 2023.

 

A significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years. We are currently party to numerous master service agreements, and typically have multiple agreements with each of our customers. Master Service Agreements (MSAs) generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discreet pricing for individual tasks. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. The remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects. Long-term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date. Short-term contracts for specific projects are generally three to four months in duration. The percentage of revenue from long-term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts.

 

Operating Expenses

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our operating expenses were $7,303,317, compared to $12,796,114 for the same period of 2023. The decrease of $5,492,797 is primarily related to a decrease in cost of revenue of $4,580,929 due to the decrease in sales discussed above as well as higher margin contracts during the current year. There were also decreases of $674,267 and $223,319, respectively, in general and administrative expenses and salaries and wages due to certain cost cutting measures.

 

Other (Expense) Income

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had other expense of $762,102, compared to other income of $4,136,964 for the same period of 2023. The change of $4,799,066 is primarily related to the gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities and gain on extinguishment of derivatives of $3,140,404 and $1,692,232, respectively, in the prior year, as well as $214,737 of warrant expense during the current year. The change was partially offset by the gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $241,993 in the current year.

 

Net (Loss) Income

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss attributable to High Wire Networks, Inc. common shareholders of $414,438, compared to net income of $168,309 in the same period of 2023. 

   

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024, our total current assets were $5,059,022 and our total current liabilities were $15,754,492, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10,695,470, compared to a working capital deficit of $9,915,819 as of December 31, 2023.

 

While we had income from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we have historically suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have historically raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

  

Based on management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are:

 

          a)   Due to our small size, we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting

                process. The areas where we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements, approval of

                purchases and approval of accounts payable invoices for payment. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in

                nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements will

                not be prevented or detected on a timely

                basis;

 

          b)   we do not have any formally adopted internal controls surrounding our cash and financial reporting procedures; and

 

          c)   the lack of the quantity of resources to implement an appropriate level of review controls to properly evaluate the

                completeness and accuracy of transactions entered into by our

                company.

 

We are committed to improving our financial organization. In addition, we will look to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function to resolve non-routine or complex accounting matters.

 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
