CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.

 

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including those set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our other filings with SEC. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:

 

     ●    Changing conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas and other trade actions and

           import restrictions which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash

           flows.

     ●    Changes in the availability or price of inputs such as raw materials and end-of-life vehicles which could reduce our sales.

     ●    Significant decreases in scrap metal prices which may adversely impact our operating results.

     ●    Imbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry which may reduce demand for our products.

     ●    Impairment of long-lived assets and equity investments which may adversely affect our operating results.

     ●    Governmental agencies’ refusal to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate.

 

Compliance with existing and future climate change and greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations which may adversely impact our operating results.

 

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law.

 

                                                                   ii

GREENWAVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, INC.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

March 31, 2024 (Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Overview

 

Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc. (“Greenwave”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “ours”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform developer under the name MassRoots, Inc. The Company sold its social media assets in October 2021 and has discontinued all operations related to this business. On September 30, 2021, we closed our acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. (“Empire”), which operates 13 metal recycling facilities in Virginia and North Carolina. The acquisition was effective October 1, 2021 upon the effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger in Virginia.

 

In December 2022, we began offering hauling services to corporate clients. We haul sand, dirt, asphalt, metal, and other materials in a fleet of approximately 50 trucks which we own, manage, and maintain.

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Empire Services, Inc., Liverman Metal Recycling, Inc., Empire Staffing, LLC, Scrap App, Inc., and Greenwave Elite Sports Facility, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions were eliminated during consolidation.

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and its financial position as of March 31, 2024 have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year.

 

Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024 (the “Annual Report”). The December 31, 2023 balance sheet is derived from those statements.

 

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S LIQUIDITY PLANS

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $713,218 and a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $(20,489,101). The accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024 was $(429,326,935). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.

 

If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital will be impacted by market conditions and the price of the Company’s common stock.

 

                                                                   6



                                                         

 

Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used in the calculation of stock-based compensation, payroll tax liabilities with interest and penalties, deemed dividends, allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in right-of-use and lease liability calculations, valuations and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combination, estimated useful life of long-lived assets and finite life tangible assets, and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 825-10, “Financial Instruments” (“ASC 825-10”) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk.

 

The Company follows ASC 825-10, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.

 

Cash

 

For purposes of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the uninsured balances amounted to $505,707 and $1,267,659, respectively.

 

                                                                   7



                                                         

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable represent amounts primarily due from customers on product and other sales. These accounts receivable, which are reduced by an allowance for credit losses, are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company delivers shipments of scrap metal to customers and typically receives payment within 45 days of delivery.

 

The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors, including the aging of customer receivable balances, the financial condition of the Company’s customers, historical collection rates, and economic trends. Management uses this evaluation to estimate the amount of customer receivables that may not be collected in the future and records a provision for expected credit losses. Accounts are written off when all efforts to collect have been exhausted. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accounts receivable balances amounted to $943,245 and $646,413, respectively.

 

Property and Equipment, net

 

We state property and equipment at cost or, if acquired through a business combination, fair value at the date of acquisition. We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, except for our leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease term. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. We expense costs for repairs and maintenance when incurred. Our property and equipment is pledged as collateral for certain factoring advances and promissory notes, see Note 8 – Factoring Advances and Non-Convertible Notes.

 

Cost of Revenue

 

The Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of purchasing metal from its suppliers, direct costs of providing hauling costs to customers, and cost of other revenue, including sand.

 

Related Party Transactions

 

Parties are considered related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions. See Note 17 – Related Party Transactions.

 

Leases

 

The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, if any, are recorded when incurred.

 

In calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company excluded short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 12 – Leases.

 

                                                                   8



                                                         

 

Commitments and Contingencies

 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as set forth below, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue when services are realized or realizable and earned, less estimated future doubtful accounts.

 

The Company’s revenues are accounted for under ASC Topic 606, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers” (“ASC 606”) and generally do not require significant estimates or judgments based on the nature of the Company’s revenue streams. The sales prices are generally fixed at the point of sale and all consideration from contracts is included in the transaction price. The Company’s contracts do not include multiple performance obligations or material variable consideration.

 

In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following:

 

(i)  Identify the contract(s) with a customer;

 

(ii) Identify the performance obligation in the contract;

      

(iii)Determine the transaction price;

      

(iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

      

(v)  Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

 

The Company primarily generates revenue by purchasing scrap metal from businesses and retail suppliers, processing it, and selling the ferrous and non-ferrous metals to clients.

 

The Company realizes revenue upon the fulfillment of its performance obligations to customers.

 

Inventories

 

Although we ship the ferrous and non-ferrous metals we purchase from suppliers multiple times per day, we do maintain inventories. We calculate the value of the inventories we do carry, which consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous and nonferrous), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies, based on the net realizable value or the cost of the inventories, whichever is less. We calculate the value of the inventory based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) methodology. We calculate the value of finished products based on their net realizable value as their cost basis is not readily available. The value of our inventories was $400,219 and $ 200,428, respectively, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 5 – Inventories.

 

Advertising

 

The Company charges the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising costs were $2,374 and $5,522 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

                                                                   9



                                                         

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is expensed over the requisite service period. For stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment, including estimating volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeiture rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company follows ASC Subtopic 740-10, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740-10”) for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period.

 

If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.

 

Convertible Instruments

 

U.S. GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity.”

 

Deemed Dividend

 

The Company records, when necessary, deemed dividends for: (i) warrant price protection, based on the difference between the fair value of the warrants immediately before and after the repricing (inclusive of any full ratchet provisions); (ii) the exchange of preferred shares for convertible notes, based on the amount of the face value of the convertible notes in excess of the carrying value of the preferred shares; (iii) the settlement of warrant provisions, based on the fair value of the common shares issued; and (iv) amortization of discount on preferred stock resulting from recognition of a beneficial conversion feature.

 

Issuance of Debt Instruments With Detachable Stock Purchase Warrants

 

Proceeds from the issuance of a debt instrument with stock purchase warrants (detachable call options) are allocated to the two elements based on the relative fair values of the debt instrument without the warrants and of the warrants themselves at time of issuance. The portion of the proceeds allocated to the warrants are recorded as additional paid-in capital. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the debt instrument portion of the transaction. Such issuances generally result in a discount (or, occasionally, a reduced premium) relative to the debt instrument, which is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

 

                                                                   10



                                                         

 

Environmental Remediation Liability

 

The operations of the Company, like those of other companies in its industry, are subject to various domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance.

 

The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accruals reported on the balance sheet as current liabilities of $0 and $0, respectively, as the Company had paid all civil penalties and completed all remediation activities required under the Virginia DEQ Consent Order dated June 30, 2021. See Note 13 —Commitments and Contingencies.

 

Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved including, among others, the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved, the various technologies that can be used for remediation and the determination of acceptable remediation with respect to a particular site. Additionally, costs for environmental-related activities may not be reasonably estimable and therefore would not be included in our current liabilities.

 

Management believes these contingent environmental-related liabilities have been resolved.

 

Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Intangible assets are stated at cost and reviewed annually to examine any impairments, usually assuming an estimated useful life of five to ten years. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. The estimated useful lives of the Intellectual Property, Customer List, and Licenses assumed in the Empire acquisition is 5 years, 10 years, and 10 years, respectively. See Note 7 – Amortization of Intangible Assets.

 

Factoring Agreements

 

We have entered into factoring agreements with various financial institutions to receive cash for our future revenues. These transactions are treated as a debt instrument and are accounted for as a liability because the Company makes weekly payments towards the balance and fees. We utilize factoring arrangements as an integral part of our financing for working capital. Any change in the availability of these factoring arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owed $2,231,731 and $0, net debt discounts of $1,347,230 and $0, respectively for factoring advances. See Note 8 – Factoring Advances and Non-Convertible Notes Payable.

 

                                                                   11



                                                         

 

Segment Reporting

 

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the Chief Financial Officer, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company’s core business.

 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

 

The Company computes earnings (loss) per common share under ASC Subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share. Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods, as applicable.

 

The computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2023 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period.

NOTE 12 – LEASES

 

Property Leases (Operating Leases)

 

The Company leases its facilities and certain automobiles under operating leases which expire on various dates through 2025. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and whether it is a finance or operating leases. Right of Use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When readily determinable, the Company uses the implicit rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any fixed lease payments, including in-substance fixed lease payments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease term is determined at lease commencement and includes any non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with any options to extend that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Please also refer to the note about forward-looking information for information on such statements contained in this Quarterly Report immediately preceding Part I, Item 1.

 

Overview

 

We were formed in April 26, 2013 as a technology platform developer under the name MassRoots, Inc. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from “MassRoots, Inc.” to “Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc.” We sold all of our social media assets on October 28, 2021 for cash consideration equal to $10,000 and have discontinued all operations related to our social media business. On September 30, 2021, we closed our acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. (“Empire”), which operates 13 metal recycling facilities in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. The acquisition was effective October 1, 2021 upon the effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger in Virginia.

 

Upon the acquisition of Empire, we transitioned into the scrap metal industry which involves collecting, classifying and processing appliances, construction material, end-of-life vehicles, boats, and industrial machinery. We process these items by crushing, shearing, shredding, separating, and sorting, into smaller pieces and categorize these recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces based on density and metal prior to sale. In cases of scrap cars, we remove the catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to shredding the vehicle. We have designed our systems to maximize the value of metals produced from this process.

 

We operate an automotive shredder at our Kelford, North Carolina location and a second automotive shredder at our Carrollton, Virginia location is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2024. Our shredders are designed to produce a denser product and, in concert with advanced separation equipment, more refined recycled ferrous metals, which are more valuable as they require less processing to produce recycled steel products. In totality, this process reduces large metal objects like auto bodies into baseball-sized pieces of shredded recycled metal.

 

The shredded pieces are then placed on a conveyor belt under magnetized drums to separate the ferrous metal from the mixed nonferrous metal and residue, producing consistent and high-quality ferrous scrap metal. The nonferrous metals and other materials then go through a number of additional mechanical systems which separate the nonferrous metal from any residue. The remaining nonferrous metal is further processed to sort the metal by type, grade, and quality prior to being sold as products, such as zorba (mainly aluminum), zurik (mainly stainless steel), and shredded insulated wire (mainly copper and aluminum).

 

One of our main corporate priorities is to open a facility with rail or deep-water port access to enable us to efficiently transport our products to domestic steel mills and overseas foundries. Because this would greatly expand the number of potential buyers of our processed scrap products, we believe opening a facility with port or rail access could result in an increase in both the revenue and profitability of our existing operations.

 

Empire is headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia and employs 131 people as of May 13, 2024.

 

Products and Services

 

Our main product is selling ferrous metal, which is used in the recycling and production of finished steel. It is categorized into heavy melting steel, plate and structural, and shredded scrap, with various grades of each of those categorizations based on the content, size and consistency of the metal. All of these attributes affect the metal’s value.

 

We also process nonferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, alloys and mixed metal products. Additionally, we sell the catalytic converters recovered from end-of-life vehicles to processors which extract the nonferrous precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium.

 

We provide metal recycling services to a wide range of suppliers, including large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations.

 

Pricing and Customers

 

Prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products are based on prevailing market rates and are subject to market cycles, worldwide steel demand, government regulations and policy, and supply of products that can be processed into recycled steel. Our main buyers adjust the prices they pay for scrap metal products based on market rates usually on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. We are usually paid for the scrap metal we deliver to customers within 14 days of delivery.

 

Based on any price changes from our customers or our other buyers, we in turn adjust the price for unprocessed scrap we pay suppliers in order to manage the impact on our operating income and cash flows.

 

The spread we are able to realize between the sales prices and the cost of purchasing scrap metal is determined by a number of factors, including transportation and processing costs. Historically, we have experienced sustained periods of stable or rising metal selling prices, which allow us to manage or increase our operating income. When selling prices decline, we adjust the prices we pay customers to minimize the impact to our operating income.

 

                                                                   28



                                                         

 

Sources of Unprocessed Metal

 

Our main sources of unprocessed metal we purchase are end-of-life vehicles, old equipment, appliances and other consumer goods, and scrap metal from construction or manufacturing operations. We acquire this unprocessed metal from a wide base of suppliers including large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations who unload their metal at our facilities or we pick it up and transport it from the supplier’s location. Currently, our operations and main suppliers are located in the Hampton Roads and northeastern North Carolina markets. In the second quarter of 2023, we are expanding our operations by opening a metal recycling facility in Cleveland, Ohio.

 

Our supply of scrap metal is influenced by the overall health of economic activity in the United States, changes in prices for recycled metal, and, to a lesser extent, seasonal factors such as severe weather conditions, which may prohibit or inhibit scrap metal collection.

 

Competition

 

We compete with several large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills which own their own scrap metal processing operations, and with smaller metal recycling companies. Demand for metal products is sensitive to global economic conditions, the relative value of the U.S. dollar, and availability of material alternatives, including recycled metal substitutes. Prices for recycled metal are also influenced by tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions, and by licensing and government requirements.

 

We aim to create a competitive advantage through our ability to process significant volumes of metal products and utilize the technology solutions, our use of processing and separation equipment, the number and location of our facilities, and the operating synergies we have been able to develop based on our experience.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were proceeds from warrant exercises, bank overdrafts, factoring advances of $2,574,679, $179,501 and $2,843,950, respectively, while there were repayments of factoring advances, convertible notes, and non-convertible notes of $1,016,389, $1,497,083, and $456,776, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company received $1,876,109 from the issuance of factoring advances and $1,000,000 from the issuance of non-convertible notes, while utilizing $519,543 in the repayment of non-convertible notes and utilizing $1,985,985 for the repayment of factoring advances.

 

Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $713,218. We currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital.

 

Required Capital over the Next Fiscal Year

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $713,218 and a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $(20,489,101). The accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024 was $(429,326,935). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital will be impacted by market conditions and the price of the Company’s common stock. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 

                                                                   31



                                                         

 

Contractual Obligations

 

Our contractual obligations are included in our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. To the extent that funds generated from our operations, together with our existing capital resources, are insufficient to meet future requirements, we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings. No assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

For a discussion of our accounting policies and related items, please see the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

 

As a “smaller reporting company” we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024 were not effective (at a reasonable assurance level) due to identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.

 

To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

 

                                                                   33



                                                         

 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (issued in 2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

Based upon the assessments, management has concluded that as of March 31, 2024, there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have an adequate process established to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters, which resulted in our closing process not identifying all required adjustments and disclosures in a timely fashion.

 

 

We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate our material weaknesses, we plan to appoint additional qualified personnel with the requisite knowledge to improve the levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters; however, such remediation efforts are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing or generating significant revenue to cover the costs of implementing the changes required.

 

Until we remediate our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting such weaknesses could result in material misstatements in our financial statements not being prevented or detected.

 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

 

The Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

The Company’s CEO and CFO has identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment. The small size of the Company’s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.

 

Because of the above material weakness, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the COSO.

 

This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Quarterly Report.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

During the most recent fiscal quarter, the Company began hiring additional accounting personnel to enhance its segregation of duties and establishment of procedures in an effort to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters.

Item 1.01      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

 

Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent Private Placement 

 

On May 16, 2024, we and certain institutional and accredited investors (the “Purchasers”) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to such Purchasers an aggregate of 420,596,154 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock (the “Common Stock”), in a registered direct offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”), and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 420,596,154 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrants”) in a concurrent private placement (the “Private Placement” and together with the Registered Direct Offering, the “Offering”), for gross proceeds of $21,871,000.06, before deducting the financial advisor’s fees and other estimated offering expenses. The purchase price for each Share and the accompanying Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock is $0.052.

 

The sale and offering of the Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement was effected as a takedown off our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-271324), which became effective on April 28, 2023 (the “Registration Statement”), pursuant to a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Warrants and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants (“Warrant Shares”) were not offered pursuant to the Registration Statement and were offered pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), contained in Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

 

The Warrants will be exercisable on or after the date of stockholder approval and have an exercise price of $0.10 per share. The Warrants will expire five years from the date we obtains stockholder approval for the issuance of the Warrants and the Warrants Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. Each Warrant is subject to anti-dilution provisions to reflect stock dividends and splits or other similar transactions, and following the approval of the Company’s stockholders, (i) exercise price provisions triggered by any intervening reverse stock splits and (ii) anti-dilution provisions relating to future issuances or deemed issuances of our Common Stock at a price per share below the then-current exercise price of the Warrants. The Warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Shares. We have agreed to file a registration statement under the Act with the SEC, covering the resale of the Warrant Shares within 10 calendar days following the date of the Purchase Agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 120 days following the Closing of the Offering.

 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering to expand our metal recycling operations, bring our copper extraction system online, to pay off of our non-convertible promissory notes and for general corporate purposes. The Offering is expected to close on or about May 20, 2024.

 

Dawson James Securities, Inc. (the “Financial Advisor”), is acting as the financial advisor for the Offering. We agreed to pay the Financial Advisor a cash fee equal to $777,777.77, and to reimburse the Financial Advisor for certain expenses, including legal fees and expenses of $50,000 in the aggregate. In addition, we agreed to issue to the Financial Advisor or its designees warrants (the “Financial Advisor Warrants”) to purchase up to 7,777,777 shares of Common Stock (the “Financial Advisor Warrant Shares”). The Financial Advisor Warrants have generally the same terms and conditions as the Warrants issued to the Purchasers, except that the Financial Advisor Warrants will have a term of five years from the commencement of sales and an exercise price equal to $0.125 per share.

 

A copy of the form of the Purchase Agreement, the form of the Warrant and the form of the Financial Advisor Warrant are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 4.1, and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summaries of the terms of the form of the Purchase Agreement, the form of the Warrant and the form of the Financial Advisor Warrant are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, such documents. The legal opinion of Pryor Cashman LLP relating to the legality of the issuance and sale of the Shares in the Registered Direct Offering is attached as Exhibit 5.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
