The Chosen, Inc.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Chosen, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent television and film production company, which was created to develop and produce an episodic television series entitled The Chosen (the “Series”). The Series is based on the gospels of the Bible and tells the story of the life of Jesus Christ primarily through the perspectives of those who met him throughout his life. While the Company is primarily focused on producing the remaining three seasons of the Series, it continues to evaluate opportunities to diversify its content through other Biblical based productions.

The condensed consolidated financial statements of The Chosen, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its variable controlling interest in Impossible Math, LLC (collectively the “Company”), have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024 . The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization of content assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments, and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 

The Company changed the presentation of operating expenses related to distribution activities in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Distribution related expenses were reclassified from General and administrative costs to Distribution and marketing costs (See Note 1 and the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information). The change in presentation and classification has been applied retrospectively to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023, resulting in an increase to Distribution and marketing costs of $1,126 thousand, and a decrease to General and administrative costs of $1,126 thousand.

There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Going Concern

​

In the consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023, the Company had previously disclosed substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, which the Company determined the Company’s plans were probable to be implemented and that they alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. On May 13, 2024, the Company and Come and See Foundation, Inc. (“CAS”) signed the Asset Purchase Agreement, which provides for a series of transactions by and among the Company and CAS, following which the Company believes it has enough financial resources to fund its operations, meet its capital requirements, and fulfill its anticipated obligations in the next twelve months. Therefore, the Company has determined that the conditions and events that raised these substantial doubts no longer exist and the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Refer to Note 11 Subsequent Events, for further information on the agreement with CAS.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, exceed federally insured limits. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the bank balance exceeded the federally insured limit by $11,443 thousand and $19,028 thousand, respectively. 

A major customer is considered to be one that comprises more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable or annual revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 74.3% and 69.3%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues were collectively with two and one major customers, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 89.6% and 83% respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable were due from the two and one major customers, respectively.

Note 2 - Revenue Recognition

The Company primarily earns its revenue from licensing its intellectual property rights related to the Series. Licensed content revenues are primarily earned from licensing agreements which include distribution of the Company’s intellectual property via (i) streaming of digital media (video-on-demand (“VOD”) and subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”), (ii) physical media (digital versatile discs (“DVDs”) and Blu-ray discs), (iii) linear television, (iv) theatrical distribution of certain episodes or other content, (v) books and printed materials and (vi) merchandise. 

Under these arrangements, the Company’s performance obligation is a license of functional intellectual property that provides the licensee the right to use the Company’s internally produced programming, or uploaded marketing advertisements, as it exists at a point in time. Merchandise revenue is generated from online store and wholesale sales of The Chosen merchandise and physical media products. The Company contracts with third parties to fulfill orders and also utilizes third-party distributors to sell merchandise to retailers. 

Prior to the Second Amendment to the Contribution Agreement with CAS on October 31, 2023, the Company also generated revenues from funds received under a non-reciprocal agreement with CAS for donation proceeds received by CAS through The Chosen App to be used in furtherance of the charitable purposes of CAS, which included the production of the Series. However, after the Second Amendment to the Contribution Agreement, the Company no longer receives the contribution revenue. Contributions that were received from voluntary donations pursuant to the agreement with CAS were reported as Contribution revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in accordance with ASC Topic 958, Not-for-Profit Entities.

The following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by licensed content and merchandise revenues as well as contribution revenues (in thousands):

Contract Assets and Liabilities

A contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company’s right to bill and receive consideration and that right is conditioned upon something other than the passage of time. The Company did not have any contract assets as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Contract liabilities are recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. The Company’s contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue for cash received related to licensed content arrangements under which a payment has been received and the content has not yet been made available to the customer and

Note 3 – Earnings (loss) per share

Earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method, which involves the allocation of earnings to each class of common stock outstanding and to participating securities with rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders. Except with respect to the number of votes per share, Series A Common Stock and Series B Common Stock have the same rights and preferences, including equal rights to participation in the dividends and other distributions of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted earnings per share is the same for both classes and EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 have been presented as a single class of common stock.

All Series A Preferred Stock were previously reflected as converted into Class B Common Stock for basic EPS as of December 31, 2022 following the declaration of the Dividend to Series A Preferred Stockholders (See Note 1 and the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023). As of March 31, 2024, the Company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments outstanding.

Note 5 - Debt

On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into a financing agreement with CAS with an aggregate principal of $145,500 thousand. This loan has no maturity date with no fixed repayment schedule and is non-interest bearing for the first seven years, after which the loan accrues interest at the then-current applicable federal rate. The Company is required to repay the loan on a quarterly basis, utilizing a specified percentage of 5% applied to the proceeds received from certain of the Company’s licensed content and merchandise revenues, which continues to be paid to CAS after the aggregate principal balance is settled. The loan is recorded applying the effective interest method based on the expected repayments and estimated timing and amount due upon a potential liquidity event.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company’s repayment of the outstanding principal balance may be accelerated or be declared immediately due. Such events include voluntary or non-voluntary bankruptcy, change of control, corporate arrangement, or other customary events of non-performance. The loan is secured by the intellectual property owned by the Company, whereby CAS receives a first-priority continuing senior security interest.

On October 31, 2023, the Company and CAS mutually agreed to reevaluate certain terms of the financing arrangement with CAS, executing the Second Amendment on October 31, 2023. The Second Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt. The modification led to an adjusted aggregate principal of $145,500 thousand,minus a debt discount of $221 thousand and $7,217 thousand of additional debt issuance costs paid to CAS. The amended loan accrues interest at a rate per annum (“Interest Rate”), equal to the median secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve, plus two percent (2)%. The Company must repay the interest on the loan quarterly, following each calendar quarter. The loan is recorded applying the effective interest method over life of the loan, based on the expected maturity date of November 22, 2029.

The following table presents debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

​

The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact from the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (“NCI”) and the benefit of state income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect.

13





Table of Contents

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due the impact from the net loss attributable to NCI of $1,410 thousand offset by the benefit of state income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect of $755 thousand.

Note 8 – Employee Benefits 

The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code which covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre- or post-tax basis. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company contributions to the plan amounted to $130 thousand and $119, respectively.

Note 9 - Related Party Transactions

The Company has entered into various agreements with an executive and their immediate family member to write various books related to the Series. They receive a percentage of sales for each book. In total, the Company recognized expenses from transactions with related parties for writer fees and book royalties of $19 thousand and $22 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, there were related party liability balances of $2 thousand and $22 thousand respectively.

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Under the Company’s current license agreement with Angel Studios, the Company is required to remit payments to Angel Studios, in perpetuity, based on a specified percentage of certain of the Company’s revenues derived from The Chosen series.

Refer to Note 4 Balance Sheet Components and Note 5 Debt for information related to the Company’s contractual commitments for leasing and financing arrangements.

Litigation

As of October 18, 2022, the Company had entered into a non-exclusive license agreement (“Content License Agreement”) with Angel Studios, Inc.(“Angel”) pursuant to which the Company granted Angel a non-exclusive license to exploit the Series in exchange for a defined share of Angel’s revenues from such exploitation. As described in the Form 8-K filed on April 10, 2023 by the Company, the Company delivered to Angel a Notice of Termination of the Content License Agreement on April 4, 2023 due to Angel’s previously noticed and uncured material breaches of the Content License Agreement. Initially, the Company elected to hold the termination in abeyance pending binding arbitration of the dispute with Angel, which the Company initiated on April 6, 2023. On October 15, 2023, following additional noticed and uncured material breaches by Angel, the Company delivered to Angel a second Notice of Termination, with such termination of the Content License Agreement to be effective as of October 20, 2023. The arbitration the Company initiated to resolve the dispute on April 6, 2023 is ongoing. While there is no guarantee of the ultimate outcome of the arbitration proceedings, the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, does not believe these proceedings will have a material negative impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note 11 - Subsequent Events 

Management has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through May 15, 2024, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

On May 13, 2024, The Chosen, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with the nonprofit corporation Come and See Foundation, Inc.  Contemporaneously therewith, the Company issued a promissory note in favor of CAS, in the principal amount of approximately $11,684 thousand (the “Bridge Note”), in exchange for CAS’s making a short-term loan to the Company for such same amount.

Table of Contents

Asset Purchase Agreement

The transactions contemplated by the APA are intended to re-define the terms of an existing business relationship between the Company and CAS, pursuant to which (i) CAS currently owns the intellectual property rights to the episodic television program entitled The Chosen, including the first four existing seasons in distribution and all unproduced seasons of episodes, plus derivatives (collectively with the Series, the “The Chosen Programs”) and licenses the Commercial Rights (as defined below), including, without limitation, the right to develop, produce, distribute and market The Chosen Programs (collectively, the “Commercial Rights”), to the Company on an exclusive basis, subject to CAS’s retention of certain rights to distribute and market The Chosen Programs to the non-profit sector, pursuant to a License Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2022, by and between the Company and CAS (the “Existing License Agreement”) and (ii) the Company currently develops, produces, distributes, and markets The Chosen Programs with funding from CAS pursuant to an existing Contribution Funding and Production Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2022, between CAS and the Company (as successor-in-interest to The Chosen, LLC, a Utah limited liability company), as the same has been amended from time to time (the “Existing Funding Agreement”). 

The APA provides for, subject to certain terms and conditions, the entry into (i) a Production Services and Funding Agreement (the “PSFA”) between CAS and The Chosen Texas, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (“TCT”), and (ii) an Amended and Restated Distribution License and Marketing Services Agreement (the “DMA”, and together with the PSFA and APA, the “CAS Agreements”) between CAS and Company.  The PSFA and the DMA, together, contain the terms pursuant to which the Company will continue, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the APA (the “Closing”), develop, produce, distribute, and market The Chosen Programs.

Under the terms of the APA and the other CAS Agreements, the Company has agreed to (i) transfer the Commercial Rights and certain other assets to CAS, (ii) re-license the Commercial Rights from CAS and distribute and market The Chosen Programs on an exclusive basis subject to royalty and other terms set forth in the DMA, (iii) provide for the cancellation of the existing indebtedness owed by the Company to CAS and (iv) terminate the Existing Funding Agreement and implement the PSFA, pursuant to which the Company will be engaged to provide production services to CAS in respect of The Chosen Programs and CAS will continue fund the Company’s activities in respect of The Chosen Programs.

The consideration payable to the Company under the APA will consist of:

      (i)  the cancellation of all of the existing indebtedness owed by the Company to CAS, which includes approximately $145,500

            thousand of existing indebtedness owed by the Company to CAS under the Existing Funding Agreement, and approximately

            $11,684 thousand of indebtedness under the Bridge Note, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon as of the Closing

            Date;

            and



      (ii) up to approximately $85,000 thousand of certain milestone payments, which may be paid following the Closing to the extent

            earned upon the completion and delivery of seasons 5, 6, and 7, respectively, of the

            Series.

The Closing will take place on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions or such other date as the parties may mutually determine (the “Closing Date”).  The conditions to Closing include, among other things, at least twenty (20) calendar days having elapsed from the date of filing and distribution of the Company’s definitive information statement on Schedule 14C to its stockholders with respect to the transaction under the APA, the accuracy of representations and warranties, material performance of covenants, and no occurrence of a material adverse effect. 

Bridge Note

The Bridge Note bears interest at a rate equal to 7% per annum and matures and becomes payable by the Company on the earliest of the Closing Date, the termination of the APA and the date on which all amounts under the Bridge Note become due and payable due to the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Bridge Note).  Events of Default include (as more fully described in the Bridge Note):

      ●    the Company’s failure to pay any amount of principal or interest when due;



      ●    the Company’s breach of any representation or warranty made to CAS pursuant to the Bridge Note;

15





Table of Contents

      ●    the Company’s breach or failure to perform any of its covenants, agreements, or obligations under the Bridge Note

            (including, without limitation, not to undertake a major transaction, e.g. a merger or other sale transaction other than

            as contemplated by the APA or incur any additional non-ordinary course indebtedness without CAS’s consent);

            



      ●    certain cross-defaults under any other existing indebtedness of the Company, the APA or any ancillary agreement thereto, or

            any other material contract to which the Company is a

            party;



      ●    certain bankruptcy proceedings; and



      ●    certain judgments or decrees against the Company.

All of the Company’s obligations under the Bridge Note will become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.

The Company determined the transaction contemplated through the CAS Agreements does not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations presentation as it is not considered a component of an entity that comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company, nor is not considered to represent a strategic shift in the Company’s operations. As of March 31, 2024, the combined net carrying amounts of assets to be disposed of through the APA are film costs of $59,149 thousand, recognized and measured in accordance with ASC Subtopic 926-20, Entertainment—Films—Other Assets—Film Costs, and insignificant carrying value related to copyright and trademark intangible assets. The Company determined there was no impairment loss to be recognized related to film costs as a result of the contemplated transactions.

Licensed Content and Merchandise Revenues

Licensed content and merchandise revenues include payments received, principally via royalties, from our licensing agreements and sales of merchandise. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11,550 thousand, or 72%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to all episodes of Season 4 being released theatrically in the United States, and various Season 4 episodes released internationally in the first quarter of 2024 of $12,430 thousand compared to theatrical releases of two episodes of Season 3 in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in revenues related to merchandise of $2,679 thousand, as merchandise sales were softer in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. The remaining is attributable to an increase in revenues of licensing Seasons 1-3 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Contribution Revenues

Contribution revenues is comprised of contributions received revenues under a non-reciprocal agreement with the CAS for donation proceeds received by CAS through The Chosen App to help fund the future production of the Series. Contribution revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $8,726 thousand. While the Second Amendment executed in October 2023 modified and revised various commercial terms, it also eliminated the obligation of CAS to continue to provide Contribution Revenue to the Company. As such, no additional Contribution Revenue was received by the Company for reporting periods subsequent to the signing of the Second Amendment. 

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues primarily include the costs of products, third party expenses to fulfill merchandise sales orders, costs associated with events related to The Chosen, and participation and residual costs owed to writers, producers, actors and other film participants. Cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $4,417 thousand, or 75% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the theatrical release of Season 4. The increase was driven by an increase to costs related to actor theatrical release bonuses of $3,845 thousand and increased actor and residual costs of $2,383 thousand. These cost increases

were partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales related to merchandise of $1,811 thousand, as merchandise sales were softer in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023.

Distribution and Marketing

Distribution and marketing include costs to promote the Series and primarily includes marketing on social and digital platforms as well as costs for producing marketing and managing the exploitation of the licensed content for both domestic and international audiences. Distribution and Marketing expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased $12,017 thousand, or 437% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, which is primarily attributable to increased marketing costs to promote the theatrical release of Season 4 and extended worldwide distribution of the previously released Seasons. Specifically, the Company released all episodes of Season 4 in theaters across the United States and various Season 4 episodes internationally in 36 countries. The Company also executed four international theatrical premier events (England, Poland, Mexico, and Brazil) in addition to the United States theatrical premier event in Los Angeles, CA. The increases in Distribution and Marketing expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2024 represent strategic expansion in both domestic and international markets which will support future releases of the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons.

Amortization of Film Costs

Costs of producing the Series are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the Company’s estimated ultimate revenue.

Amortization of film costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $6,851 thousand, or 172%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the additional amortization of film costs as a result of the release of Season 4 in the first quarter of 2024.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $681 thousand, or 32%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the Company completing construction on a second soundstage late in the first quarter of 2024.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased $8,598 thousand, or 160%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to, (i) legal, accounting and professional fees of $4,205 thousand primarily attributed to the ongoing arbitration with Angel Studios, the continuing negotiations with CAS on the follow-up to the Second Amendment and other professional services to support various corporate initiatives, (ii) information technology and administrative related expenses of $3,086 thousand primarily attributed to mobile app development and hosting costs, (iii) payroll expenses of $450 thousand primarily attributed to the Company’s growth.

Income Taxes

Income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31,2024 decreased $7,636 thousand or (473%), as compared to three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of the Company’s expected tax benefit at U.S. Federal statutory rates of $5,812 thousand.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 9% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact from the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $1,410 thousand offset by the benefit of state income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect of $755 thousand.

​

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are from cash flows generated from operations and financing activities. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $19,117 thousand and $65,179 thousand, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had long-term debt of $138,703 thousand and $138,387, respectively. 

The Company’s primary uses of cash generally relate to film costs. The decrease in cash of $46,062 thousand was primarily attributable to an increase of $8,267 thousand in film costs related to the production of Season 4 and an increase of $15,511 in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase of $1,197 thousand in accrued expenses and other accrued liabilities and $21,655 thousand in net loss.

The Company’s long-term debt relates to the agreement with CAS, whereby CAS provided $145,500 thousand for the Company’s use in the development, production, distribution and marketing of the Series and to provide the Company with operating and working capital.

The Company believes its existing cash and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and expected cash needs from known contractual agreements for the next twelve months and beyond.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

Our cash flow activities were as follows for the periods presented:

Financing activities

There were no financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net cash flows used in financing activities of $10,659 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily included dividend payments of $10,417 thousand.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on our Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Film Costs

Costs of producing the Series are amortized, and residual and participation costs are accrued, using the individual-film-forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the Company’s estimated remaining ultimate revenue per each episodic block. The initial estimate of ultimate revenue includes estimates of revenues through various distribution channels such as theatrical, home entertainment and other distribution platforms and are based on historical experience for past seasons. The Company regularly monitors the performance of each season, and evaluates whether impairment indicators are present (i.e., low ratings), and based upon our review, the Company revises the estimates as needed.

Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some seasons are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises, when necessary, its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value.

An increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, lesser film amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film amortization expense.

The amortization of film costs is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing. On average, over 50% of the film costs related to our produced content is expected to be amortized within one year after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors that may impact the amortization of film costs on a monthly basis, such as prospective licensing arrangements, monitoring the popularity of the show, as well as market and consumer trends. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
