CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for the purposes of the federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to: any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.

 

Forward-looking statements may include the words “may,” “could,” “will,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” “believe,” “expect” or “anticipate” or other similar words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement.

 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to:

 

               ●    Increased competitive pressures from existing competitors and new entrants;

                     

               ●    Increases in interest rates or our cost of borrowing or a default under any material debt agreement;

                     

               ●    Deterioration in general or regional economic conditions;

                     

               ●    Adverse state or federal legislation or regulation that increases the costs of compliance, or adverse findings by

                     a regulator with respect to existing

                     operations;

                     

               ●    Loss of customers or sales weakness;

                     

               ●    Inability to achieve future sales levels or other operating results;

                     

               ●    The unavailability of funds for capital expenditures; 

                     

               ●    Operational inefficiencies in distribution or other systems; and

                     

               ●    New tariffs relating to raw materials imported from China.

 

For a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024

(U.S. Dollars - Unaudited)

 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements (“consolidated financial statements”) include the accounts of Flexible Solutions International, Inc. (the “Company”), its wholly-owned subsidiaries Flexible Fermentation Ltd., NanoChem Solutions Inc. (“NanoChem”), Flexible Solutions Ltd., Flexible Biomass LP, FS Biomass Inc., NCS Deferred Corp., Natural Chem SEZC Ltd., InnFlex Holdings Inc., ENP Peru Investments LLC (“ENP Peru”), its 80% controlling interest in 317 Mendota LLC (“317 Mendota”), and its 65% controlling interest in ENP Investments, LLC (“ENP Investments”) and ENP Mendota, LLC (“ENP Mendota”). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company was incorporated on May 12, 1998 in the State of Nevada and in 2019, the Company redomiciled into Alberta, Canada.

 

In 2022, NanoChem purchased an additional 50% in ENP Peru, increasing its share to 91.67%. ENP Investments owned the remaining 8.33%, of which the Company has a 65% interest. In 2023, NanoChem purchased the remaining 8.33% of shares to become sole owner. ENP Peru was previously accounted for under the equity method however, it is now consolidated into the financial statements from the date control was obtained.

 

In 2023, the Company purchased an 80% interest in 317 Mendota, a newly incorporated company established to purchase a large manufacturing building. ENP Investments will occupy part of this building, freeing up more space in the building owned by ENP Peru for NanoChem. The Company intends to rent the remainder of the space to suitable tenants. The remaining 20% non-controlling interest is held by unrelated parties.

 

The Company and its subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market specialty chemicals which slow the evaporation of water. One product, HEATSAVR®, is marketed for use in swimming pools and spas where its use, by slowing the evaporation of water, allows the water to retain a higher temperature for a longer period of time and thereby reduces the energy required to maintain the desired temperature of the water in the pool. Another product, WATERSAVR®, is marketed for water conservation in irrigation canals, aquaculture, and reservoirs where its use slows water loss due to evaporation. In addition to the water conservation products, the Company also manufactures and markets water-soluble chemicals utilizing thermal polyaspartate biopolymers (hereinafter referred to as “TPAs”), which are beta-proteins manufactured from the common biological amino acid, L-aspartic. TPAs can be formulated to prevent corrosion and scaling in water piping within the petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries. TPAs are also used as proteins to enhance fertilizers in improving crop yields and can be used as additives for household laundry detergents, consumer care products and pesticides. The TPA division also manufactures two nitrogen conservation products for agriculture that slows nitrogen loss from fields.

 

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except where otherwise noted, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern and reflect the policies outlined below.

 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2024 and the results of its operations for the three months then ended. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements.

 

(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents.

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

 

(b) Term Deposits.

 

The Company has five term deposits that are maintained by commercials banks. The first term deposit is for $688,126 and matures in April 2024. This deposit pays 4.908% interest and if withdrawn before maturity, the greater of the loss of accrued interest or $150, plus 1% of the principal shall be levied. The second term deposit is for $303,954 and matures in February 2025. This deposit pays 1.3% interest and if withdrawn before maturity, a penalty may be applied. The third term deposit is for $720,982, matures in May 2024 and pays interest at a rate of 3.00%. If withdrawn before maturity, the greater of the loss of accrued interest or $150, plus 1% of the principal shall be levied. The fourth term deposit is for $1,000,000 and matures in May 2024. This deposit pays 3.85% and if withdrawn before maturity, the greater of the loss of accrued interest or $150, plus 1% of the principal shall be levied. The fifth term deposit is for $310,695, matures in August 2024 and pays interest at a rate of 3.85%. If withdrawn before maturity, a penalty may be applied.

 

(c) Inventories and Cost of Sales.

 

The Company has three major classes of inventory: completed goods, work in progress and raw materials and supplies. In all classes inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis or weighted average cost formula to inventories in different subsidiaries. Cost of sales includes all expenditures incurred in bringing the goods to the point of sale. Inventory costs and costs of sales include direct costs of the raw material, inbound freight charges, warehousing costs, handling costs (receiving and purchasing) and utilities and overhead expenses related to the Company’s manufacturing and processing facilities. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenue (2024 - $128,289; 2023 - $143,173). Shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold (2024 - $216,503; 2023 - $255,489).

 

                                                                   7                                                                    



                                                         

 

(d) Allowance for expected credit losses.

 

The Company’s expected credit losses are determined through a review using historical credit loss experience; changes in asset specific characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable future forecasts, among other specific account data, and is performed at least quarterly. The company develops and documents its methodology to determine its allowance for expected credit losses. Risk characteristics used by the Company may include customer mix, knowledge of customers and general economic conditions of the various local economics, among others. Specific account balances are written off when management determines the amounts to be uncollectible. Management has reviewed the balance reserved through the allowance for expected losses and believes it is reasonable.

 

(e) Property, Equipment, Leaseholds and Intangible Assets.

 

The following assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the methods and annual rates shown below:

 SCHEDULE OF METHOD OF DEPRECIATION

                                                                

               Manufacturing equipment                         20% Declining balance

               Office equipment                                20% Declining balance

               Building and improvements                       10% Declining balance

               Automobiles                                     Straight-line over 5 years

               Technology                                      Straight-line over 10 years

               Leasehold improvements                          Straight-line over lease term

               Customer relationships                          Straight-line over 15 years

                                                                

 

(f) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

 

In accordance with FASB Codification Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the Company reviews long-lived assets, including, but not limited to, property, equipment and leaseholds, patents and other assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is assessed for impairment by evaluating operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. If the expected future cash flows of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment measurement is indicated. Impairment charges are recorded to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. There were no impairment charges during the periods presented.

 

(g) Foreign Currency.

 

The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of three of the Company’s subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar. The translation of the Canadian dollar to the reporting currency of the Company, the U.S. dollar, is performed for assets and liabilities using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense transactions are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising on conversion of the Company’s financial statements from the subsidiary’s functional currency, Canadian dollars, into the reporting currency, U.S. dollars, are excluded from the determination of income (loss) and are disclosed as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

 

Foreign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions not denominated in the applicable local currency are included in operating income (loss) if realized during the year and in comprehensive income (loss) if they remain unrealized at the end of the year.

 

(h) Revenue Recognition.

 

The Company generates revenue primarily from energy and water conservation products and biodegradable polymers, as further discussed in Note 15.

 

                                                                   8                                                                    



                                                         

 

The Company follows a five-step model for revenue recognition. The five steps are: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation, and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has fulfilled its performance obligations when control transfers to the customer, which is generally at the time the product is shipped since risk of loss is transferred to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier. For shipments which are free-on-board shipping point, the Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised service and performance obligation.

 

Since the Company’s inception, product returns have been insignificant; therefore, no provision has been established for estimated product returns.

 

Deferred revenues consist of products sold to distributors with payment terms greater than the Company’s customary business terms due to lack of credit history or operating in a new market in which the Company has no prior experience. The Company defers the recognition of revenue until the criteria for revenue recognition has been met and payments become due or cash is received from these distributors.

 

(i) Stock Issued in Exchange for Services.

 

The Company’s common stock issued in exchange for services is valued at estimated fair market value based upon trading prices of the Company’s common stock on the dates of the stock transactions. The corresponding expense of the services rendered is recognized over the period that the services are performed.

 

(j) Stock-based Compensation.

 

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments in accordance with FASB Codification Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (ASC 718). Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, the Company recognizes share-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award.

 

The fair value at grant date of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the stock option vesting period based on the estimated number of stock options that are expected to vest. Shares are issued from treasury upon exercise of stock options.

 

(k) Other Comprehensive Income.

 

Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income, but are excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. The Company’s other comprehensive income is comprised only of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the translation of subsidiaries’ functional currency into the reporting currency.

 

(l) Income Per Share.

 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated giving effect to the potential dilution of the exercise of options and warrants. Common equivalent shares, composed of incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants are included in diluted net income per share to the extent that these shares are dilutive. Common equivalent shares that have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per share have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

                                                                   9                                                                    



                                                         

 

(m) Use of Estimates.

 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and would impact the results of operations and cash flows.

 

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each period end. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

 

Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include assumptions and estimates relating to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of assets acquired at fair value, asset impairment analysis, share-based payments, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, determination of useful lives of property, equipment and leaseholds and intangible assets, recoverability of accounts receivable, recoverability of investments, discount rates for right of use assets and the costing and recoverable value of inventory.

 

(n) Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs described below, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.

 

          ●    Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

          ●    Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for

                similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or

                can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or

                liabilities.

          ●    Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity which is significant to the fair value

                of the assets or

                liabilities.

 

The fair values of cash, term deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and the short term line of credit for all periods presented approximate their respective carrying amounts due to the short term nature of these financial instruments.

 

The fair value of the long term debt and lease liabilities for all periods presented approximate their respective carrying amounts due to these financial instruments being at market rates.

 

(o) Contingencies.

 

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

 

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.

 

                                                                   10                                                                   



                                                         

 

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Legal fees associated with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company is not aware of any contingencies at the date of these consolidated financial statements.

 

(p) Income Taxes.

 

Income taxes are computed by multiplying the Company’s taxable net income by the Company’s effective tax rates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss carry-forwards, if any. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.

 

In accordance with FASB Codification Topic 740, Income taxes (ASC 740) under the liability method, it is the Company’s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At March 31, 2024, the Company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. Interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

 

(q) Risk Management.

 

The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its accounts receivable. The amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts, estimated by the Company’s management based on prior experience and the current economic environment. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-payment by customers. Credit exposure is minimized by dealing with only credit worthy counterparties. Revenue for the Company’s three primary customers totaled $5,106,905 (55%) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $4,366,106 or 44%). Accounts receivable for the Company’s three primary customers totaled $7,843,766 (60%) at March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023 - $6,561,164 or 67%). See Note 4 for allowance for doubtful accounts, all unrelated to our primary customers.

 

The credit risk on cash is limited because the Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with major financial institutions. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

 

The Company is exposed to foreign risk to the extent that market value rate fluctuations materially differ for financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

 

In order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks, the Company closely monitors the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates and the impact on the value of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company has not hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations.

 

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that the fair value or future cash flows for financial liabilities will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt subject to fixed long-term interest rates.

 

In order to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, the Company closely monitors fluctuations in market interest risks and will refinance its long-term debt where possible to obtain more favourable rates.

(r) Equity Method Investment.

 

The Company accounts for investments using the equity method of accounting if the investment provides the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company’s ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee ranges between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee’s board of directors, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets under other assets and adjusted for dividends received and the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary impairments which are recorded through other income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

 

(s) Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level. The evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further analysis is necessary. However, if the results of the qualitative test are unclear, the Company performs a quantitative test, which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company uses an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and no further analysis is necessary. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

 

Intangible assets primarily include trademarks and trade secrets with indefinite lives and customer-relationships with finite lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed using either a qualitative or a quantitative approach. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry and company-specific factors, legal and regulatory environments, and historical company performance in assessing fair value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. When using a quantitative approach, the Company compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of an impairment charge for the differential.

 

In accordance with FASB Codification Topic 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350), qualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were performed at December 31, 2023. Based on the results of the assessment, it was determined that it is more likely than not the reporting unit, customer lists and trademarks had a fair value in excess of their carrying amounts. Accordingly, no further impairment testing was completed and no impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles were recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews for impairment indicators of finite-lived intangibles and other long-lived assets as described in the “Impairment of Long Lived Assets” significant accounting policy.

 

(t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

 

The Company has implemented all applicable new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. Those pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

3. LEASES 

 

Leases are evaluated and classified as either operating or finance leases by the lessee and as either operating, sales-type or direct financing leases by the lessor. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Leases may include fixed rental escalation clauses, renewal options and / or termination options that are factored into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. The Company’s operating leases are included in ROU assets, lease liabilities-current portion and lease liability-long term portion in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company’s leases do not usually provide a readily determinable implicit rate; therefore, an estimate of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to discount the lease payments based on information available at the lease commencement date. The discount rate used was 5.5%.

 

In March 2024, the Company consolidated NanoChem operations into the Peril, IL locations and terminated the lease in Naperville, IL. The Company had to pay a penalty of $35,910 and forfeited the $5,440 security deposit to terminate the lease early and incurred a loss of $41,350 on early termination of the lease. The table below summarizes the right-of-use asset and lease liability for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

9. INVESTMENTS 

 

(a) The Company previously held a 50% ownership interest in ENP Peru, split between NanoChem (41.67%) and ENP Investments (8.33%), which was acquired in fiscal 2016. ENP Peru is located in Illinois and leases warehouse space to other entities in the Company. In June 2022, NanoChem acquired an additional 50% ownership interest at a cost of $506,659 paid through a new $259,000 mortgage and cash on hand. The 35% non-controlling interest of the 8.33% owned by ENP Investments is included in non-controlling interest in these consolidated financial statements. The Company’s investment in ENP Peru was previously accounted for using the equity method, however, it is now consolidated into the consolidated financial statements from the date control was obtained. In June 2023, NanoChem purchased the remaining 8.33% of ENP Peru from ENP Investments to become full owner.

 

It was determined that ENP Peru did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with FASB Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), and the acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation of the consideration paid to the respective fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in ENP Peru as of the acquisition date. The gain on acquisition of ENP Peru represents a gain on remeasurement of the Company’s equity method investment immediately prior to the acquisition date.

12. STOCK OPTIONS

 

The Company has a stock option plan (“Plan”). The purpose of this Plan is to provide additional incentives to key employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries in order to help attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of responsibility and otherwise promote the success of the Company’s business. It is intended that options issued under this Plan constitute non-qualified stock options. The general terms of awards under the option plan are that 100% of the options granted will vest the year following the grant unless a executive employee is granted a multi-year stock option grant where an equal amount vests over the next 5 years. The maximum term of options granted is 5 years and the exercise price for all options are issued for not less than fair market value at the date of the grant.

 

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three-month period ended March 31, 2024:

15. SEGMENTED, SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY

 

The Company operates in two segments:

 

(a) Energy and water conservation products (as shown under the column heading “EWCP” below), which consists of a (i) liquid swimming pool blankets which save energy and water by inhibiting evaporation from the pool surface, and (ii) food-safe powdered form of the active ingredient within the liquid blankets and which are designed to be used in still or slow moving drinking water sources.

 

(b) Biodegradable polymers, also known as TPA’s (as shown under the column heading “BCPA” below), used by the petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries to prevent corrosion and scaling in water piping. This product can also be used in detergents to increase biodegradability and in agriculture to increase crop yields by enhancing fertilizer uptake.

 

The third product line is nitrogen conservation products used for the agriculture industry. These products decrease the loss of nitrogen fertilizer after initial application and allows less fertilizer to be used. These products are made and sold by the Company’s TPA division.

 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes, not including nonrecurring gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses

 

The Company’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different, but synergistic products and services. They are managed separately because each business requires different technology and marketing strategies.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 

Overview

 

The Company manufactures and markets biodegradable polymers which are used in the oil, gas and agriculture industries. The Company also develops, manufactures and markets specialty chemicals that slow the evaporation of water.

 

Results of Operations

 

We have three product lines.

 

The first is a chemical (“EWCP”) used in swimming pools and spas. The product forms a thin, transparent layer on the water’s surface. The transparent layer slows the evaporation of water, allowing the water to retain a higher temperature for a longer period of time thereby reducing the energy required to maintain the desired temperature of the water. A modified version of EWCP can also be used in reservoirs, potable water storage tanks, livestock watering pods, canals, and irrigation ditches for the purpose of reducing evaporation.

 

The second product, biodegradable polymers (“TPAs”), is used by the petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries to prevent corrosion and scaling in water piping. TPAs can also be used to increase biodegradability in detergents and in the agriculture industry to increase crop yields by enhancing fertilizer uptake.

 

The third product line is nitrogen conservation products used for the agriculture industry. These products decrease the loss of nitrogen fertilizer after initial application and allows less fertilizer to be used. These products are made and sold by the Company’s TPA division.

Other factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be:

 

                     ●         the sale price of crude oil which is used in the manufacture of aspartic acid we import from China.

                                Aspartic acid is a key ingredient in our TPA

                                products;

                                

                     ●         activity in the oil and gas industry, as we sell our TPA products to oil and gas companies;

                                

                     ●         drought conditions, since we also sell our TPA products to farmers; and

                                

 

Other than the foregoing we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on our revenues or expenses.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Under the direction and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching desired disclosure control objectives. Based on the evaluation, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of March 31, 2024

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, it was concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
