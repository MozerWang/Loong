NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short- term and long-term business operations, and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”) as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in any subsequent filings with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. Our management cannot predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events, and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

 

We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 

Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Crypto,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these condensed consolidated financial statements refer to The Crypto Company and, where appropriate, its wholly-owned subsidiary Blockchain Training Alliance, Inc. (“BTA”) and an inactive subsidiary Coin Tracking, LLC (“CoinTracking”).

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Organization and Description of the Business

 

The Crypto Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 9, 2017. The Company is engaged in the business of providing consulting, training, and educational and related services for distributed ledger technologies (“blockchain”), for corporate and individual clients, enterprises for general blockchain education, as well as for the building of technological infrastructure and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. In recent periods the Company has generated revenues and incurred expenses primarily through these consulting and related operations.

 

Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Crypto,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these condensed consolidated financial statements refer to The Crypto Company and, where appropriate, its wholly-owned subsidiary Blockchain Training Alliance, Inc. (“BTA”) and an inactive subsidiary Coin Tracking, LLC (“CoinTracking”).

 

The Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) effective as of March 24, 2021 with BTA and its stockholders. On April 8, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of BTA and BTA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of this acquisition, the operations of BTA became consolidated with Company operations on April 8, 2021.

 

BTA is a blockchain training company and service provider that provides training and educational courses focused on blockchain technology and education as to the general understanding of blockchain to corporate and individual clients.

 

The Company’s accounting year-end is December 31.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Going Concern

 

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flows since inception. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $21,887. In addition, the Company’s net loss was $1,102,738 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the Company’s had a working capital deficit of $4,219,094. As of March 31, 2024, the accumulated deficit amounted to $45,549,340. As a result of the Company’s history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management is evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund the Company’s expenses and achieve a level of revenue adequate to support the Company’s current cost structure. Financing strategies may include, but are not limited to, private placements of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of these future-funding efforts will be successful. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

Management’s Representation of Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and disclosures normally included in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements include all of the adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023.

 

The Company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements based upon the accrual method of accounting, recognizing income when earned and expenses when incurred.

 

                                                                   8



 

 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company’s significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to the valuation allowances of deferred taxes, and share-based compensation expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, any change in these estimates or their related assumptions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company defines its cash and cash equivalents to include only cash on hand and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions, the balances of which may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the risk of loss due to the concentration is minimal.

 

Investments in Cryptocurrency

 

Investments were comprised of several cryptocurrencies the Company owned, of which a majority was Bitcoin, that were actively traded on exchanges. During 2018, the Company sold most of its investments and during 2019 wrote-off the remainder of all those investments because there was no method to obtain liquidity for those investments. The Company recorded this recovery as other income in its condensed consolidated financial statements. As previously disclosed, the Company has ceased operations of its former cryptocurrency investment segment, and the Company liquidates newly issued/accessible assets from old investments as promptly as practicable for the sole purpose of winding down the Company’s legacy cryptocurrency investment segment.

 

The Company records its investments as indefinite-lived intangible assets at cost less impairment and are reported as long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. The primary exchanges and principal markets the Company utilized for its trading were Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, and Bitstamp.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had written off the value of its investments in cryptocurrency.

 

Investments Non-cryptocurrency

 

The Company previously invested in simple agreements for future tokens (“SAFT”) and a simple agreement for future equity (“SAFE”) agreements. The SAFT agreements provide for the issuance of tokens in anticipation of a future token generation event, with the number of tokens predetermined based on the price established in each respective agreement. The SAFE investment included provisions that provide for either equity or tokens, or both. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had written-off its investments in non- cryptocurrency.

 

                                                                   9



 

 

Business Combination

 

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the dates of acquisition.

 

Income Taxes

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future consequences of events that have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 

When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we are subject to federal taxation in the U.S., as well as state taxes. The Company has not been audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company recognizes and discloses the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and the difficulty involved in determining fair value.

 

Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurable date.

 

Level 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.

 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

 

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:

 

          ●    Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer

          ●    Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

          ●    Step 3: Determine the transaction price

          ●    Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

          ●    Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation

 

In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).

 

If a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.

 

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:

 

Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.

 

The Company adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for contracts as of the date of initial application. There was no cumulative impact on the Company’s retained earnings.

 

During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s main source of revenue was consulting and education services to numerous customers provided by and through BTA. The Company has determined that revenue should be recognized over time, as the service is provided. The Company considered the criteria in ASC 606 in reaching this determination, specifically:

 

          ●    The customer receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Company’s performance as the Company performs.

          ●    The Company’s performance enhances an asset controlled by the customer.

          ●    The Company’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and the Company has an enforceable right to

                payment for performance completed to

                date.

 

The consulting and education services performed during the period ended March 31, 2024, meet more than one of the criteria above.

 

Share-based Compensation

 

In accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, the Company measures the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value of granted instruments and recognizes the costs in condensed financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options.

 

                                                                   11



 

 

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. Previously, share-based payments to nonemployees was accounted for in accordance with ASC No. 505, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, which required compensation cost to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting period when the award vests. As a result, stock option-based payments to non-employees resulted in significant volatility in compensation expenses in prior years.

 

The Company accounts for its share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company’s common stock price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the time over which employees and non- employees are expected to hold their options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate.

 

Net Loss per Common Share

 

The Company reports earnings per share (“EPS”) with a dual presentation of basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed as net income divided by the weighted average of common shares for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issued through stock options, or warrants. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. Therefore, the basic EPS and diluted EPS are the same.

 

NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its condensed financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

NOTE 4 -GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 

The Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) effective as of March 24, 2021 with BTA and its stockholders. On April 8, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of BTA and BTA became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the closing, the Company delivered to the sellers a total of $600,000 in cash, promissory notes in the total principal amount of $150,000 bearing 1% interest per annum, and an aggregate of 201,439 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $604,317, in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Additionally, the Company acquired $4,860 in cash from BTA.

 

As a result of the foregoing, the Company initially recorded goodwill of $1,349,457. The Company conducted a valuation study upon the closing of the acquisition of BTA. The final valuation report determined the amount goodwill to be $740,469, with the remaining $650,000 of the goodwill relating to amortizable intangibles amortized over a fifteen-year period, or approximately $54,166 per year.

 

During the three months months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded $10,833 in amortization expense.

 

NOTE 5 – NOTES PAYABLE

 

On April 3, 2018, CoinTracking entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with CoinTracking GmbH, which provided for total borrowings of up to $3,000,000. During 2018, CoinTracking borrowed $1,500,000 in exchange for three promissory notes (collectively, the “CoinTracking Note”) in the principal amounts of $300,000, $700,000, and $500,000, respectively. On December 31, 2018, the CoinTracking Note was still outstanding. On January 2, 2019, the Company sold its equity ownership stake in CoinTracking GmbH, and $1,200,000 of the sales proceeds were applied toward repayment of the $1,500,000 outstanding loan amount under the CoinTracking Note. The remaining balance of $300,000 was outstanding as of September 30, 2022, with a due date of March 31, 2023, which due date was extended from the prior due date of March 31, 2021 pursuant to an amendment dated December 28, 2018. The CoinTracking Note bears interest at 3%, which is payable monthly, in arrears. All payments shall be applied first to all accrued and unpaid interest and second to the outstanding principal balance, as applicable. The maturity date of the CoinTracking Note has not been extended nor has any default been asserted by the lender.

 

Interest expense for Notes Payable was $103,367 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 compared to $37,441 during the three month period ended March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

     ●    On June 10, 2020, the Company received a loan from the Small Business Administration of $14,100 (the “2020 SBA Loan”). The

           2020 SBA Loan bears interest at 3.75% per annum and is payable over 30 years with all payments of principal and interest

           deferred for the first 12

           months.

           

          As of March 31, 2024, the balance remaining under the 2020 SBA Loan is $13,146.

 

                                                                   12



 

 

● Effective February 23, 2022, the Company entered into two separate Purchase Agreement and Bill of Sales to purchase a total of 215 cryptocurrency miners (each, a “Purchase Agreement”). The first Purchase Agreement was entered into with Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (“BIT”) whereby the Company agreed to purchase a total of 95 miners for a total purchase price of $337,500 and the second Purchase Agreement was entered into with Innovative Digital investors, LLC (“IDI”) whereby the Company agreed to purchase a total of 120 miners for a total purchase price of $696,000. In each case the Company paid one half of the purchase price at closing (effective February 25, 2022) and the other half of the purchase price is payable in accordance with a 10% unsecured promissory note delivered to each of BIT and IDI. The promissory note delivered to BIT is in the principal amount of $168,750, is payable in two installment payments, and by its original term had a maturity date of May 15, 2022. The promissory note delivered to IDI is in the principal amount of $348,000, is payable in four installment payments, and by its original terms had a maturity date of October 15, 2022.

 

The maturity dates of the Bitmine promissory note delivered to each of BIT and IDI (originally May 15, 2022 and October 15, 2022) were, in each case extended by two months by mutual agreement of the parties due to supply chain delays effecting the shipment and delivery of the mining equipment to the Company.

 

● Effective January 13, 2022, the Company borrowed funds pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB”), and issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “Jan. AJB Note”) to AJB in a private transaction for a purchase price of $675,000 (giving effect to a 10% original issue discount). The maturity date of the Jan. AJB Note was July 12, 2022. The Jan. AJB Note bears interest at 10% per year, and principal and accrued interest was to be due on the maturity date. In connection with a subsequent loan extended to the Company by AJB on or about May 3, 2022 (as further described below) the Company repaid all outstanding obligations that were due to AJB under the Jan. AJB Note.

 

● Effective January 18, 2022, the Company borrowed funds pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Sixth Street SPA”) entered into with Sixth Street Lending, LLC (“Sixth Street”) and issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $116,200 (the “Sixth Street Note”) to Sixth Street in a private transaction to for a purchase price of $103,750 (giving effect to an original issue discount). The Company agreed to various covenants in the Sixth Street SPA. The Sixth Street Note had a maturity date of January 13, 2023 and the Company agreed to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Sixth Street Note at the rate of twelve percent (12.0%) per annum from the date on which the Sixth Street Note was issued until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. Payments are due monthly, beginning in the end of February 2022. The Company had the right to prepay the Sixth Street Note in accordance with the terms set forth in the Sixth Street Note.

 

In connection with a subsequent loan extended to the Company by 1800 Diagonal Lending, LLC on or about September 30, 2022 (as further described below) the Company repaid all outstanding obligations that were due to Sixth Street under the Sixth Street Note.

 

● On February 24, 2022, the Company borrowed funds pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Feb. SPA”) entered into with AJB, and issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $300,000 (the “Feb. Note”) to ABJ in a private transaction for a purchase price of $275,000 (giving effect to an original issue discount). The maturity date of the Feb. Note is August 24, 2022, but it may be extended for six months upon the consent of AJB and the Company. The Feb. Note bears interest at 10% per year, and principal and accrued interest is due on the maturity date. The Company may prepay the Feb. Note at any time without penalty. The Company’s failure to make required payments under the AJB Note or to comply with various covenants, among other matters, would constitute an event of default. Upon an event of default under the Feb. SPA or Feb. Note, the Feb. Note will bear interest at 18%, AJB may immediately accelerate the Feb.

The June 2020 Notes will automatically convert into shares of common stock on the earlier to occur of a) a qualified equity financing, with the conversion price equal to 50% of the common stock price paid by the purchasers of the equity, or b) on the maturity date, at a price per share equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on that date. If a change in control occurs before either of the automatic conversion events, the holders of the June 2020 Notes will have the option to convert the June 2020 Notes at a price per share equal to the fair market value of the common stock at the time of such conversion. The Company can prepay the principal and interest, in cash, at any time without any premium or penalty. The June 2020 Notes have no voting rights, do not participate in dividends, and are unsecured.

NOTE 8 - SUMMARY OF STOCK OPTIONS

 

On July 21, 2017, the Company’s board of directors adopted The Crypto Company 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved by its stockholders on August 24, 2017.

Awards may be granted to officers, employees, non-employee directors (as defined in the Plan) and other key persons (including consultants and prospective employees). The term of any stock option award may not exceed 10 years and may be subject to vesting conditions, as determined by the Administrator. Options granted generally vest over eighteen to thirty-six months. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of the Company or any subsidiary that is a “subsidiary corporation” within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023

 

Revenue

 

Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, were $15,806 and $156,895, respectively. The decrease in revenue was due to less of a demand for blockchain training services. Revenue for the 2024 period consisted primarily of fees received for blockchain training and consulting generated by the Company’s BTA subsidiary which was acquired in April 2021.

 

                                                                   21



 

 

General and Administrative Expenses

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were $442,830, an increase of $11,781 compared to $431,049 for the period ended March 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs relating to professional services, payroll, and payroll-related expenses. Professional services included in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of contracting fees, consulting fees, and accounting fees.

 

Amortization expense was $10,833 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Depreciation expense was $0 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Share-based compensation was $463,198 and $386,560 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Other Income (Expense)

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, other income was $0.

 

Interest Expense

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, interest expense was $200,157 compared to $1,970,913 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to the issuance of promissory notes payable during the 2023 period.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management is evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund our expenses and achieve a level of revenue adequate to support our current cost structure. Financing strategies may include but are not limited to, private placements of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships, and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of these future-funding efforts will be successful. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Trends, Events, and Uncertainties

 

Blockchain

 

The blockchain technology market is dynamic and unpredictable. Although we will undertake compliance efforts, including efforts with commercially reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that there will not be a new or unforeseen law, regulation or risk factor which will materially impact our ability to continue our business as currently operated or raise additional capital to foster our continued growth.

 

COVID-19

 

The continuing effect of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a slowdown in economic activity, disrupting supply chains, and reducing workforces, increasing market volatility and consequently, impacting our operational and financial performance. It is impossible to predict the ultimate degree to which future variants of COVID-19 and their spread could lead to continuing significant and material disruptions in economic activity, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 

Other than as discussed in this Quarterly Report and our 2023 Annual Report, we are not aware of any other trends, events, or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.

 

                                                                   22



 

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosure as filed in our 2023 Annual Report.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of March 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

 

In evaluating us and our common stock, we urge you to carefully consider the risks and other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A. of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Upon an event of default, consistent with the terms of the Coventry Note, the Coventry Note becomes convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at Coventry’s option. On April 24, 2023, the Company received a notice of default in the amount of $17,916.94 of principal and $2,083.06 of interest.
