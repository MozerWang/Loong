Aspira Women’s Health Inc.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1.ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES

Organization 

Aspira Women’s Health Inc. (“Aspira” and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company”) is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is engaged in the business of developing and commercializing diagnostic tests for gynecologic disease. The Company currently markets and sells the following products and related services: 

(1) the Ova1Plus workflow, which uses Ova1 as the primary test and Overa as a reflex for Ova1 intermediate range results. Ova1 is a qualitative serum test intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery is planned when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. Overa is a second-generation biomarker test intended to maintain Ova1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity. The Ova1 workflow leverages the strengths of Ova1’s (MIA) sensitivity and Overa’s (MIAG2G) specificity to reduce incorrectly elevated results; and 

(2) OvaWatch, a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”) intended in the clinical assessment of malignancy risk in all women thought to have an indeterminate or benign adnexal mass. 

Collectively, these tests are referred to and marketed as OvaSuite. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s product and related revenue was limited to the products described above, as well as residual revenue from Aspira GenetiX, which was discontinued in the third quarter of 2022. The Company’s products are distributed through its own national sales force, including field sales, inside sales and a contracted sales team, through its proprietary decentralized testing platform and cloud service marketed as Aspira Synergy, and through marketing and distribution agreements with BioReference Health, LLC and ARUP Laboratories.

Overa is currently not offered commercially except as a reflex test performed as part of the Ova1Plus workflow.

Going Concern and Liquidity

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $3,413,000 of cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash of $260,000), an accumulated deficit of approximately $522,932,000, and working capital of approximately $829,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,629,000, and used cash in operations of $4,431,000. The Company has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. The Company also expects to continue to incur a net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the remainder of 2024. In order to fund operations, meet its capital requirements or satisfy the anticipated obligations as they become due, the Company expects to take further action to protect its liquidity position, which include, but are not limited to:

•Raising capital through equity or debt offerings either in the public markets or via private placement offering, to the extent that the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, the Company’s stockholders may experience significant dilution. However, no assurance can be given that capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all;

•Securing debt, however, no assurance can be given that debt will be available on acceptable terms or at all;

•Reducing executive bonuses or replacing cash compensation with equity grants;

•Reducing professional services and consulting fees and eliminating non-critical projects;

•Reducing travel and entertainment expenses; and 

•Reducing eliminating or deferring discretionary marketing programs.

The Company also has outstanding warrants to purchase shares of its common stock that may be exercised although there can be no assurance that the warrants will be exercised.

There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations. Management expects cash from product sales and licensing to be the Company’s only material, recurring source of cash in 2024. Given the above conditions, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these consolidated interim financial statements are filed. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of results for the periods presented, have been included. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim period. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 included in this report has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information and notes required by GAAP. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated results. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

Revenue Recognition 

Product Revenue – OvaSuite: The Company recognizes product revenue in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Product revenue is recognized upon completion of the OvaSuite test and delivery of results to the physician based on estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount of revenue to be recognized for a delivered test result, the Company considers factors such as payment history and amount, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and the Company, and any developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management as the collection cycle on some accounts can be as long as one year. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate at the time of the change.    

The Company also reviews its patient account population and determines an appropriate distribution of patient accounts by payer (i.e., Medicare, patient pay, other third-party payer, etc.) into portfolios with similar collection experience. The Company has elected this practical expedient that, when evaluated for collectability, results in a materially consistent revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account were evaluated on an individual contract basis. During the period ended March 31, 2024, there were $8,000 of adjustments to estimates of variable consideration to derecognize revenue for services provided in a prior period. There were no impairment losses on accounts receivable recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The Company has discontinued providing Aspira GenetiX, including genetics carrier screening, on the Aspira Synergy platform, effective September 30, 2022.

Accounts Receivable: Virtually all accounts receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America. The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and the resulting trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable, including the historical collection cycle. Amounts are written off against the allowances for credit losses when the Company determines that a customer account is not collectable. The Company believes its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diversity of its payer base.

Warrants: The Company accounts for common stock warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the warrants and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815-40”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815-40, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own stock and whether the events where holders of the warrants could potentially require net cash settlement are within the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance. Warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance and are not remeasured. Warrants that do not meet the required criteria for equity classification are classified as liabilities. The Company adjusts such warrants to fair value at each reporting period until the warrants are exercised or expire. Any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). This update was issued to assist in simplifying the accounting for convertible instruments. This ASU is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”) to clarify guidance in Topic 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and also requires specific disclosures related to an equity security. ASU 2022-03 is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect a material impact as a result of this standard on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative (“ASU 2023-06”). The amendments in this ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of ASC topics by aligning them with the SEC’s regulations. ASU 2023-06 will become effective for each amendment on the effective date of the SEC's corresponding disclosure rule changes. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-06 will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) to update reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss, requires interim disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually, requires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, and contains other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 

2.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Financial instruments of the Company consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash accounts, receivable, and accounts payable, and warrant liability. These items are considered Level 1 due to their short-term nature and their market interest rates. Warrant liability is considered Level 2 and is recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Debt is considered Level 3, which the Company does not record at fair value.

 

The Company records warrants in connection with a public offering in 2022 (the “2022 Warrants”) as a liability. As discussed in Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in connection with a registered direct offering in 2024, the Company amended certain of the 2022 Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,664 shares (the “Modified Warrants”). The terms of the remaining 433,321 of the 2022 Warrants were unchanged (the “Unmodified Warrants”).

The fair values of the Warrants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately $1,400,000 and $1,651,000, respectively. The fair value of the 2022 Warrants was estimated using Black-Scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions:

 

                                                                March 31, 2024                                December 31, 2023

                                                 Unmodified                      Modified                                       

                                                  Warrants                       Warrants

Dividend yield                                            —  %                                  — %                     —  %

Volatility                                            104.9  %                              101.7 %                 105.1  %

Risk-free interest rate                                4.31  %                               4.21 %                  3.93  %

Expected lives (years)                                 3.39                                  4.83                    3.64   

Weighted average fair value           $               1.329          $                      2.247     $             2.064   

 

The 2022 Warrants were deemed to be derivative instruments due to certain contingent put features. The fair value of the 2022 Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, deemed to be an appropriate model due to the terms of the 2022 Warrants issued, including a fixed term and exercise price.

The fair value of the Warrants was affected by changes in inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model including the Company’s stock price, expected stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free interest rate. This model uses Level 2 inputs, including stock price volatility, in the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The 2022 Warrants are classified as a long-term liability on the Company’s balance sheet.

The carrying value of the Company’s insurance promissory note approximates fair value as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the short-term nature of the insurance note and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

The DECD loan is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of the DECD loan. The fair value of the DECD loan is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market interest rates.

 

                                                                 March 31,                              December 31,

4.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Loan Agreement 

On March 22, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement (as amended, the “DECD Loan Agreement”) with the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (the “DECD”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $4,000,000 from the DECD. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.0% per annum and requires equal monthly payments of principal and interest until maturity, which occurs on January 1, 2032. As security for the loan, the Company has granted the DECD a blanket security interest in the Company’s personal and intellectual property. The DECD’s security interest in the Company’s intellectual property may be subordinated to a qualified institutional lender. 

The loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. An initial disbursement of $2,000,000 was made to the Company on April 15, 2016 under the DECD Loan Agreement. On December 3, 2020, the Company received a disbursement of the remaining $2,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement, as the Company had achieved the target employment milestone necessary to receive an additional $1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement and the DECD determined to fund the remaining $1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement after concluding that the required revenue target would likely have been achieved in the first quarter of 2020 in the absence of the impacts of COVID-19. 

Under the terms of the DECD Loan Agreement, the Company was eligible for forgiveness of up to $1,500,000 of the principal amount of the loan if it was able to achieve certain job creation and retention milestones by December 31, 2022. On June 26, 2023, the Company was notified by the DECD that the Company satisfied all job creation and retention requirements under the loan agreement to receive forgiveness of $1,000,000. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded the $1,000,000 as other income in the statement of operations. If the Company fails to maintain its Connecticut operations through March 22, 2026, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion or all of the remaining amount of the loan plus a penalty of 5% of the total funded loan. 

On June 6, 2023, the Company was granted a deferral of interest and principal payments on a portion of the remaining outstanding balances through December 1, 2023. On January 30, 2024, the Company was granted an additional deferral of interest and principal payments on a portion of the remaining outstanding balances through June 1, 2024. The Company determined the loan deferrals met the definition of a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors, as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and the lenders granted a concession. The future undiscounted cash flows of the DECD loan after the loan deferrals exceeded the carrying value of the DECD loan prior to the loan deferrals. As such no gain was recognized as a result of the deferrals.

Insurance Notes

During 2023, the Company entered into an insurance promissory note for the payment of insurance premiums at an interest rate of 7.79%, with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $416,000 and $670,000 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest paid for the promissory note was $6,000 for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount outstanding in 2024 could be substantially offset by the cancellation of the related insurance coverage which is classified in prepaid insurance. This note is payable in nine monthly installments with a maturity date of October 1, 2024 and has no financial or operational covenants. 

Operating Leases 

The Company leases facilities to support its business. The Company’s principal facility, including the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) laboratory used by Aspira Labs, Inc., is located in Austin, Texas, and administrative offices are located in Trumbull, Connecticut and Palo Alto, California.

In October 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a facility in Trumbull, Connecticut, which was renewed in September 2020. In May 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the owner of its Trumbull, Connecticut offices to move to a more economical location in Shelton, Connecticut and replacing the Trumbull, Connecticut office lease. The new lease term is for five years, and its commencement date was October 1, 2023. Beginning on October 1, 2023, the fixed lease payment was reduced from approximately $8,900 per month to $5,000 per month for the first year, and to $5,383 per month for years two through four and $5,768 per month for the fifth year. Continuation of the lease would be on a month-to-month basis.

In January 2023, the Company entered into a new sublease agreement for an administrative facility in Palo Alto, California. The Company’s sublease term commenced in April 2023 and terminates on May 31, 2024, with no option for renewal with the sublessor. The fixed lease payment was initially approximately $9,000 per month and increased to approximately $10,000 per month beginning in January 2024.

In July 2023, the Company extended the Austin, Texas lease for an additional 37 months. The Company’s renewed lease expires on February 28, 2027, with the option to extend the lease for an additional three years. Prior to the renewal, the Company’s Texas lease had a term of 12 months, and the Company has elected the policy of not recording leases on the balance sheet when the leases have terms of 12 months or less. Through June 30, 2023, the Company recognized the lease payments in profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for the payments was incurred. Variable lease costs represent the Company’s share of the landlord’s operating expenses. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the Company added the extended Austin, Texas lease to its balance sheet as a right-of-use asset. Beginning February 1, 2024, the fixed lease payment were reduced from approximately $9,490 per month to approximately $7,100 per month for the first year (except for August 2024, which will be $0), and will be approximately $8,600 per month for the second year, approximately $8,900 per month for the third year and approximately $9,100 for the final month. The Company is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the three-year renewal option beginning on March 1, 2027.

6.STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT

2024 Registered Direct Offering

On January 24, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2024 Direct Offering Agreement”), with several investors relating to the issuance and sale of 1,371,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), in a registered direct offering, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 1,571,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Purchase Warrants”, and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants, the “Warrants”) in a concurrent private placement (the “Concurrent Private Offering” and together with the registered direct offering, the “2024 Direct Offering”).  

Pursuant to the 2024 Direct Offering Agreement, the Company issued 1,368,600 shares of common stock to certain investors at an offering price of $3.50 per share, and 2,400 shares of common stock to its Chief Executive Officer, Nicole Sandford, at an offering price of $4.2555 per share, which was the consolidated closing bid price of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 24, 2024 of $4.13 per share plus $0.125 per Purchase Warrant. The purchase price of each Pre-Funded Warrant is equal to the combined purchase price at which a share of Common Stock and the accompanying Purchase Warrant is sold in this 2024 Direct Offering, minus $0.0001. The gross proceeds to the Company from the 2024 Direct Offering were approximately $5,563,000, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated expenses of $694,000 payable by the Company. The 2024 Direct Offering closed on January 26, 2024.

The Pre-Funded Warrants were exercisable at any time after the date of issuance and had an exercise price of $0.0001 per share. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants could not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage to a percentage not in excess of 9.99% by providing at least 61 days’ prior notice to the Company. All of the Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised on February 6, 2024 for gross proceeds of $20.

The Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of $4.13 per share and will be exercisable beginning six months after issuance and will expire 5 years from the initial exercise date.

The Company engaged AGP to act as sole placement agent in the 2024 Direct Offering. The Company paid the placement agent a cash fee equal to 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds generated from the 2024 Direct Offering, except that, with respect to proceeds raised in this 2024 Direct Offering from certain designated persons, AGP’s cash fee is reduced to 3.5% of such proceeds, and to reimburse certain fees and expenses of the placement agent in connection with the 2024 Direct Offering. The Company also reimbursed the placement agent for its accountable offering-related legal expenses of $75,000 and a non-accountable expense allowance of $30,000. Costs related to the 2024 Direct Offering were recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital on the Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

The Company evaluated the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Purchase Warrants and concluded that they met the criteria to be classified as equity within additional paid-in-capital. 

The Pre-Funded Warrants are equity classified because they (1) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock, (2) are immediately exercisable, (3) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (4) permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (5) are indexed to the Company's common stock and (6) meet the equity classification criteria. 

The Purchase Warrants are equity classified because they (1) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock, (2) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (3) permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (4) are indexed to the Company's common stock and (5) meet the equity classification criteria.

Effective upon the closing of the 2024 Direct Offering, the Company also amended certain existing warrants (the “2022 Warrants”), see Note 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,664 shares at an exercise price of $13.20 per share and a termination date of August 25, 2027, so that the amended 2022 Warrants have a reduced exercise price of $4.13 per share and a new termination date of January 26, 2029. The other terms of the amended 2022 Warrants remain unchanged. The Company performed an analysis of the fair value of the 2022 Warrants immediately before and after the modification and the increase in fair value of the 2022 Warrants of $490 thousand was recorded as a change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the unaudited condensed statement of operations.

Approximately $106,000 of the costs related to the 2024 Direct Offering were allocated to the 2022 Warrants and were recorded as other expense in the unaudited condensed statement of operations.

Over the life of the Cantor Sales Agreement, the Company sold 35,552 shares of the Placement Shares for gross proceeds of approximately $211,000.

2023 Equity Line of Credit

On March 28, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “LPC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) and a registration rights agreement (the “LPC Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to sell to Lincoln Park shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), having an aggregate value of up to $10,000,000 (the “Purchase Shares”), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement. The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of Purchase Shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement.

Under the LPC Purchase Agreement, on any business day after March 28, 2023 selected by the Company over the 36-month term of the LPC Purchase Agreement (each, a “Purchase Date”), the Company may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 6,667 shares of Common Stock on such Purchase Date (a “Regular Purchase”); provided, however, that (i) a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 13,333 shares, if the closing sale price per share of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is not below $7.50 on the applicable Purchase Date; (ii) a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 16,666 shares, if the closing sale price per share of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is not below $11.25 on the applicable Purchase Date; and (iii) a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 20,000 shares, if the closing sale price per share of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is not below $15.00 on the applicable Purchase Date. In any case, Lincoln Park’s maximum obligation under any single Regular Purchase will not exceed $1,000,000. The above-referenced share amount limitations and closing sale price thresholds are subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction as provided in the LPC Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for each such Regular Purchase will be equal to the lesser of:

1.the lowest sale price for the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the date of sale; and

2.the average of the three lowest closing sale prices for the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market during the 10 consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately preceding the purchase date. 

The Company also has the right to direct Lincoln Park, on any business day on which the Company has properly submitted a Regular Purchase notice for the maximum amount the Company is then permitted to sell to Lincoln Park in such Regular Purchase, to purchase an additional amount of the Common Stock (an “Accelerated Purchase”) of additional shares based on criteria established in the LPC Purchase Agreement. An Accelerated Purchase, which is at the Company’s sole discretion, may be subject to additional requirements and discounts if certain conditions are met as defined in the LPC Purchase Agreement. 

The issuance of the Purchase Shares had been previously registered pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252267) (the “Old Registration Statement”), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement filed on March 28, 2023, that has expired. On April 22, 2024, the Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278867) (the “Registration Statement”), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement, that was declared effective by the SEC on April 25, 2024.

These transaction costs were included in other expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. Approximately $38,000 was incurred for legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2023, and were included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.

Company Overview 

Corporate Vision

We are dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of noninvasive, AI-powered tests to aid in the diagnosis of gynecologic diseases, starting with ovarian cancer. 

We plan to broaden our focus to the differential diagnosis of other gynecologic diseases that typically cannot be assessed through traditional non-invasive clinical procedures. We expect to continue commercializing our existing and new technology and to distribute our tests through our decentralized technology transfer service platform, Aspira Synergy. We also intend to continue to raise public awareness regarding the diagnostic superiority of Ova1Plus as compared to cancer antigen 125 (“CA-125”) on its own for all women with adnexal masses, as well as the superior performance of our machine learning algorithms in detecting ovarian cancer in different racial and ethnic populations. We plan to continue to expand access to our tests among Medicaid patients as part of our corporate mission to make the best care available to all women, and we plan to advocate for legislation and the adoption of our technology in professional society guidelines to provide broad access to our products and services.

We continue to focus on three key initiatives: growth, innovation, and operational excellence. 

Growth.  As a revenue-generating diagnostics company focused exclusively on gynecologic disease, our commercial capabilities are one of our most important differentiators. We expect our extensive experience with gynecologists and healthcare providers, along with the historical adoption of our OvaSuite tests, to drive growth as we introduce new products. 

During 2023, we conducted a comprehensive review of our commercial programs to identify people, processes, and technology enhancements. As a result of the findings of that review, we implemented a revised commercial strategy (the “Commercial Refresh”) in the second half of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we completed the successful implementation of the Commercial Refresh and expect to leverage these enhancements as we continue to focus on growth through improving the profitability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the sales and marketing teams. 

The average number of full-time representatives in the first quarter of 2024 was 16, compared with 21 representatives in the first quarter of 2023. The average OvaSuite volume per full-time sales representative increased from 298 tests per representative in the first quarter of 2023 to 364 tests per representative in the first quarter of 2024. 

Innovation.  We believe our ability to successfully develop novel AI-powered assays is superior to others based on our know-how and extensive experience in designing and successfully launching FDA-cleared and laboratory developed blood tests to aid in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. We own and operate Aspira Labs, Inc., a research and commercial CLIA laboratory in Texas, and have accumulated more than 110,000 patient samples in our research biobank. Moreover, our history of successfully collaborating with world-class research and academic institutions allows us to innovate and provide outstanding patient care.

Our product pipeline is focused on two areas: ovarian cancer and endometriosis. 

In ovarian cancer, we have developed clinical data to support the repeated use of our OvaWatch test for the monitoring of an adnexal mass. In the second quarter of 2024, we expanded the features of our commercially available OvaWatch test for monitoring of adnexal masses through periodic testing at physician prescribed intervals. As a result, we believe the addressable market for the test to be two to three times that of the single use test when applied to the more than 1.2 million women in the United States diagnosed with an adnexal mass each year.  

We also made significant progress in the development of OvaMDx, a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata) and miRNA for assessing the risk of ovarian cancer in women with an adnexal mass. The test is being developed in collaboration with Harvard’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, and Medical University of Lodz. 

In endometriosis, we are developing and intend to introduce a new noninvasive test to aid in the diagnosis of this debilitating disease that impacts millions of women worldwide. We completed the design of EndoCheck, a protein-based blood test to aid the detection of endometrioma, one of the most common forms of endometriosis. EndoCheck is the first ever noninvasive test of its kind, a significant achievement. The algorithm was confirmed with three independent cohorts and is an important input for our EndoMDx test, a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata) and miRNA for the identification of endometriosis which is also in development.

Our endometriosis portfolio addresses an even larger addressable market. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, endometriosis affects more than 6.5 million women in the United States. We believe the proliferation of commercially available and in-development therapeutics for the treatment of endometriosis will create a significant demand for a non-invasive diagnostic. 

Operational Excellence.  During the first quarter of 2024, we decreased our operating expenses by $1.3 million, while also achieving our cash utilization goals for the quarter by continuing to focus on spending that fuels innovation and growth. We raised gross proceeds of $5.6 million in January 2024 in a follow-on offering.

Our Business and Products

We currently commercialize the following products and related services: 

(1) the Ova1Plus workflow, which uses Ova1 as the primary test and Overa as a reflex for Ova1 intermediate range results. Ova1 is a qualitative serum test intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery is planned when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. Overa is a second-generation biomarker test intended to maintain Ova1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity. The Ova1Plus workflow leverages the strengths of Ova1’s MIA sensitivity and Overa’s (MIA2G) specificity to reduce incorrectly elevated results; and 

(2) OvaWatch, an LDT intended to assist in the initial clinical assessment of malignancy risk in all women thought to have an indeterminate or benign adnexal mass.

Our products are distributed through our own national sales force, including field sales, inside sales and a contracted sales team, through our proprietary decentralized testing platform and cloud service, marketed as Aspira Synergy, and through marketing and distribution agreements with BioReference Health, LLC and ARUP Laboratories.

Our Ova1 test received FDA de novo classification in September 2009. Ova1 comprises instruments, assays, reagents, and the OvaCalc software, which includes a proprietary algorithm that produces a risk score. Our Overa test, which includes an updated version of OvaCalc, received FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2016. Ova1, Overa and OvaWatch each use the Roche Cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms for analysis of proteins. Revenue from these sources is included in the results of operations in total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

In 2021, we began entering into decentralized arrangements with large healthcare networks and physician practices for our Aspira Synergy platform, our decentralized testing platform and cloud service for decentralized global access of protein biomarker testing. Ova1, Overa, and the Ova1Plus workflow continue to be available through the Aspira Synergy platform. As of March 31, 2024, we had one active Aspira Synergy contract. 

OvaWatch has been developed and is validated for use in Aspira’s CLIA-certified lab as a non-invasive blood-based risk assessment test for use in conjunction with clinical assessment and imaging to determine ovarian cancer risk for patients with an adnexal mass whose adnexal mass has been determined by an initial clinical assessment as indeterminate or benign. The commercialization plan for OvaWatch has two phases. Phase I, which was launched during the fourth quarter of 2022, is a single use, point-in-time risk assessment test, and Phase II, which was launched during the second quarter of 2024 allows for longitudinal testing. We believe OvaWatch has the potential to significantly expand the addressable market compared to the Ova1Plus workflow.

Outside of the United States, we have sponsored studies in both the Philippines and Israel, which were intended to validate Overa and Ova1 in specific populations. In February 2024, we signed an exclusive license agreement with Hi-Precision Laboratories in the Philippines. 

We own and operate Aspira Labs, based in Austin, Texas, a Clinical Chemistry and Endocrinology Laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. Aspira Labs provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based risk assessment to aid in clinical decision making and to advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently performs our Ova1Plus workflow and OvaWatch testing, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. Aspira’s Labs holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a supplier number to Aspira Labs in 2015. Aspira Labs also holds a current ISO 13485 certification which is the most accepted standard worldwide for medical devices.

In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare Administrative Carrier, covers and reimburses for Ova1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to our billed Ova1 tests being performed exclusively at Aspira Labs in Texas, the Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. We have applied for an LCD for OvaWatch, which is currently under review.

In November 2016, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174 which included Ova1, defined as the “Multivariate Index Assay,” outlining ACOG’s clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management. Practice Bulletin Number 174 recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses who do not meet Level A criteria of a low-risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines. Level B guidelines state that the physician may use risk-assessment tools such as existing CA-125 technology or Ova1 (“Multivariate Index Assay”) as listed in the bulletin. Based on this, Ova1 achieved parity with CA-125 as a Level B clinical recommendation for the management of adnexal masses.

Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence. This is also the 

 

20



 

only clinical management tool used for adnexal masses. Although there are Practice Bulletins, guidelines do not exist for adnexal masses. ACOG guidelines do exist, however, for ovarian cancer management.   

Product Pipeline

We aim to introduce new gynecologic diagnostic products and to expand our product offerings to additional women’s gynecologic health diseases by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, genetics, clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification. Future product expansions will be accelerated by the development of lab developed testing in a CLIA environment, relationships with strategic research and development partners, and access to specimens in our biobank. 

 

•OvaWatch is the only commercially available blood test to assess the risk of ovarian cancer in women diagnosed with an adnexal mass considered indeterminate or benign by initial clinical assessment. In January 2023, we published a manuscript entitled: “Validation of deep neural network-based algorithm supporting the clinical management of adnexal mass,” in Frontiers in Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal to support the clinical adoption of OvaWatch as a single-use test. We collected additional clinical data to support the utility of OvaWatch to aid in surgical referral and as a longitudinal monitoring test. Two manuscripts were published in peer review journals in May 2024. OvaWatch was commercially launched as a longitudinal monitoring tool in the second quarter of 2024. 

•OvaMDx is a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata) and miRNA for assessing the risk of ovarian cancer in women with an adnexal mass. The test is being developed in collaboration with Harvard’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, and Medical University of Lodz. We are currently in the process of completing final test design, including conducting verification experiments to transfer the test to the FDA approved PCR system. 

The miRNAs used in the OvaMDx test were the subject of a 2017 paper, “Diagnostic potential for a serum miRNA neural network for detection of ovarian cancer” published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Biology. In October 2023, a poster entitled “Improving the diagnostic accuracy of an ovarian cancer triage test using a joint miRNA-protein model,” was presented at the AACR Special Conference in Cancer Research: Ovarian Cancer by senior author, Dr. Kevin Elias M.D., Director, Gynecologic Oncology Laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Assistant Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School. The poster highlighted data from a study that combined serum protein and patient clinical information (metadata) from Aspira’s ovarian cancer registry studies with miRNA determined by the Elias laboratory. The data showed using miRNA in combination with serum proteins, and provided superior performance over existing ovarian cancer risk assessment blood tests. 

•EndoCheck is the first protein biomarker test designed to identify ovarian endometriomas, one of the most common forms of endometriosis. We have confirmed the algorithm with three independent cohorts, achieving preliminary performance that supports its use to aid the detection and treatment of endometrioma. Data related to the performance of EndoCheck was presented at the 71st Annual Scientific Meeting for the Society for Reproductive Investigation (SRI) in Vancouver, Canada in March 2024. We are currently evaluating the potential commercial application and appropriate launch timeline for EndoCheck. 

•EndoMDx is a multi-marker test that combines serum proteins, clinical data (metadata) and miRNA for the identification of endometriosis. The test is being developed in collaboration with a consortium of academic and clinical partners led by Dana Farber Cancer Institute. We are currently in the process of completing final test design, including conducting verification experiments to transfer the test to an FDA approved PCR system, which is expected to be completed by mid-2024. 

Recent Developments

Business Updates

On August 8, 2022, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with DFCI, BWH, and Medical University of Lodz (the “Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz Research Agreement”) for the generation of a multi-omic, non-invasive diagnostic aid to identify endometriosis based on circulating microRNAs and proteins. Under the Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz Research Agreement, payments of approximately $1,252,000 have or will become due from us to the counterparties upon the successful completion of deliverables as defined in the agreement as follows: 68% was paid in 2022, 15% was paid in 2023, and the remaining 17% will become payable upon completion of certain deliverables estimated to occur in the first half of 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately $34,000 has been recorded as research and development expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the project. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, approximately $23,000, was recorded as research and development expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement of operations for the project. From the inception of the agreement through March 31, 2024, research and development expenses in the cumulative amount of $1,117,000 have been recorded.

On March 20, 2023, we entered into a licensing agreement (“Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz License Agreement”) with DFCI, BWH, and Medical University of Lodz under which the Company will license certain of our intellectual property to be used in our OvaSuite product portfolio. Under the Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz License Agreement, we paid an initial license fee of $75,000 and then will pay a license maintenance fee of $50,000 on each anniversary of the date of the Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz License Agreement. The Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz License Agreement also requires non-refundable royalty payments of up to $1,350,000 based on certain regulatory approvals and commercialization milestones and further royalty payments based on the net sales of our products included under the Dana-Farber, Brigham, Lodz License Agreement. No milestones have been reached as of March 31, 2024.

We prepared an application for a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (“PLA Code”) with the American Medical Association for OvaWatch to distinguish it from Ova1Plus with the expectation that Novitas and other payers will apply the Ova1Plus Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee to OvaWatch, ensuring consistent coverage and pricing for both Ova products. In December 2022, we received the approval of PLA Code for OvaWatch from the American Medical Association. Since we began billing OvaWatch with the PLA Code on April 1, 2023, our reimbursement has been consistent with historical Ova1Plus experience, resulting in the OvaWatch average unit price (“AUP”) of $338.

On May 7, 2024, we announced the publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts. The first manuscript, entitled “Ovarian Cancer Surgical Consideration is Markedly Improved by the Neural Network Powered-MIA3G Multivariate Index Assay” was published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers of Medicine on May 2, 2024. The findings of this study demonstrate that use of OvaWatch to stratify risk in patients with an adnexal mass might help to reduce surgical backlogs and unnecessary surgical referrals. The second manuscript, entitled “Neural Network-derived Multivariate Index Assay Demonstrates Effective Clinical Performance in Longitudinal Monitoring of Ovarian Cancer Risk” was published in the journal Gynecologic Oncology on May 3, 2024. The findings of this study demonstrate that OvaWatch could be an effective tool for the monitoring of ovarian cancer risk over time in women with indeterminate or low risk adnexal masses. Based on common practice for adnexal mass management and consistent with the study, OvaWatch can be drawn by the provider every three to six months for active surveillance of an adnexal mass.

Critical Accounting Estimates

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

Our product revenue is generated by performing diagnostic services using our OvaSuite tests, and the service is completed upon the delivery of the test result to the prescribing physician. The entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation contained in a contract with a patient. Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, all revenue is recognized upon completion of the OvaSuite test and delivery of test results to the physician based on estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount of revenue to be recognized for a delivered test result, we consider factors such as payment history and amount, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, and any developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. For OvaSuite tests, we also review our patient account population and determine an appropriate distribution of patient accounts by payer (i.e., Medicare, patient pay, other third-party payer, etc.) into portfolios with similar collection experience. When evaluated for collectability, this results in a materially consistent revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account were evaluated on an individual contract basis.

Product Revenue.  Product revenue was $2,153,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2,315,000 for the same period in 2023. Revenue for Aspira Labs is recognized when the Ova1, Overa, Ova1Plus or OvaWatch test is completed based on estimates of what we expect to ultimately realize. The 7% product revenue decrease is due to a decrease in OvaSuite test volume compared to the prior year. 

The number of OvaSuite tests performed decreased 4.4% to 5,829 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 6,259 product tests for the same period in 2023. This decrease is a result of our revised commercial strategy and reduced full-time field sales headcount. We expect revenue to increase in the second quarter due to our investment in key salesforce hires and strategic product development during the first quarter of 2024.

The volume and AUP for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows.

Cost of Revenue – Product.  Cost of product revenue was $939,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $1,130,000 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of $191,000, or 17%, due primarily to decreased consulting, postage and lab supply costs, resulting from the decrease in tests performed compared to the prior year. 

Gross Profit Margin.  Gross profit margin for product revenue increased to 56.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 51.2% for the same period in 2023.

Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies, and include personnel-related expenses, regulatory costs, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $361,000, or 28%, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of $369,000. We expect research and development expenses to increase over the second quarter of 2024, as a result of our focus on the product pipeline.

Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, education and promotional expenses. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians and other healthcare professionals regarding our products. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation, and dissemination of scientific and health economic publications. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $706,000, or 27%, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreased consulting costs of $376,000, personnel costs of $339,000 and travel costs of $148,000, offset by the addition of our contracted sales team. We expect sales and marketing expenses to modestly increase over the second quarter of 2024 as we continue to focus on the commercialization of OvaWatch.

General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, professional fees and other costs, including legal, finance and accounting expenses and other infrastructure expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $475,000, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in outside accounting expenses of $130,000 and consulting costs of $98,000. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat for the second quarter of 2024.

Change in fair value of Warrant liabilities.  The fair values of the warrant liabilities as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 were $1,400,000 and $1,651,000, respectively, for a net decrease in fair value of $251,000. The decrease consisted of $490,000 due to the modification of certain warrants that were originally issued in 2022, offset by the change in warrant value due to the decrease in our stock price during the quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 there was a net increase in fair value of $24,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We plan to continue to expend resources selling and marketing OvaSuite and developing additional diagnostic tests and service capabilities. 

We have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and as a result have an accumulated deficit of approximately $522,932,000 as of March 31, 2024. We also expect to incur a net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the remainder of 2024. Working capital levels may not be sufficient to fund operations as currently planned through the next twelve months, absent a significant increase in revenue over historic revenue or additional financing. Given the above conditions, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these consolidated interim financial statements are filed. 

We expect to raise capital through sources that may include public or private equity offerings, debt financings, the exercise of common stock warrants, collaborations, licensing arrangements, grants and government funding and strategic alliances, as well as our existing at-the-market and equity line of credit facilities. However, additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to continue sales and marketing, research and development, or other operations on the scope or scale of current activity, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In March 2016, we entered into a loan agreement (as amended on March 7, 2018 and April 3, 2020, the “DECD Loan Agreement”) with the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (the “DECD”), pursuant to which we may borrow up to $4,000,000 from the DECD.  

The loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. An initial disbursement of $2,000,000 was made to us on April 15, 2016 under the DECD Loan Agreement. On December 3, 2020, we received a disbursement of the remaining $2,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement, as we had achieved the target employment milestone necessary to receive an additional $1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement and the DECD determined to fund the remaining $1,000,000 under the DECD Loan Agreement after concluding that the required revenue target would likely have been achieved in the first quarter of 2020 in the absence of the impacts of COVID-19.

Under the terms of the DECD Loan Agreement, we would be eligible for forgiveness of up to $1,500,000 of the principal amount of the loan if we had achieved certain job creation and retention milestones by December 31, 2022. On June 26, 2023, we were notified by the DECD that we had satisfied all job creation and retention requirements under the loan agreement to receive forgiveness of $1,000,000. If we fail to maintain our Connecticut operations through March 22, 2026, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion or all of the loan plus a penalty of 5% of the total funded loan. For additional information, see Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

In connection with a private placement offering of common stock and warrants we completed in May 2013, we entered into a stockholders agreement which, among other things, granted two of the primary investors in that offering the right to participate in any future equity offerings by the Company on the same price and terms as other investors. In addition, the stockholders agreement prohibits us from taking certain material actions without the consent of at least one of the two primary investors in that offering. These material actions include:

•Making any acquisition with a value greater than $2 million;

•Offering, selling or issuing any securities senior to Aspira’s common stock or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for securities ranking senior to Aspira’s common stock;

•Taking any action that would result in a change in control of the Company or an insolvency event; and

•Paying or declaring dividends on any securities of the Company or distributing any assets of the Company other than in the ordinary course of business or repurchasing any outstanding securities of the Company.

The foregoing rights terminate for a primary investor when that investor ceases to beneficially own less than 50% of the shares and warrants (taking into account shares issued upon exercise of the warrants), in the aggregate, that were purchased at the closing of the 2013 private placement. We believe that the rights of one of the primary investors have so terminated.

On February 10, 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor, as agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor, shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $12.5 million. In connection with the Direct Offering on July 24, 2023, we delivered written notice to Cantor on July 19, 2023 that it was suspending the prospectus supplement, dated February 10, 2023, related to our common stock issuable under the Cantor Sales Agreement. We will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the Cantor Sales Agreement unless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC. The Cantor Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect during the suspension.

On March 28, 2023, we entered into an agreement with Lincoln Park (the “LPC Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we have the right to sell to Lincoln Park shares of our common stock (the “Purchase Shares”), having an aggregate value of up to $10 million, subject to certain limitations and conditions, at our sole discretion during a 36-month period ending March 27, 2026. 

The issuance of the Purchase Shares had been previously registered pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252267) (the “Old Registration Statement”), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement filed on March 28, 2023, that has expired. On April 22, 2024, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278867) (the “Registration Statement”), and the related base prospectus included in the Registration Statement, that has been declared effective by the SEC on April 25, 2024.

We sold 472,312 shares of Common Stock under the LPC Purchase Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $1,578,000 under the Old Registration Statement. In addition, 47,733 shares of Common Stock were issued to Lincoln Park as consideration for entering into the LPC Purchase Agreement. As of April 25, 2024, up to $8,422,000 of shares of Common Stock could be sold to Lincoln Park under the LPC Purchase Agreement, subject to the terms of the LPC Purchase Agreement.

On April 26, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the Registration Statement related to the sale of up to $3,200,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement.

On July 24, 2023, we completed a direct offering (the “Direct Offering”) resulting in net proceeds of approximately $4,157,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of $597,000.  

Under the terms of the July 24, 2023 follow-on equity offering, we agreed not to sell shares under the LPC Purchase Agreement for 90 days. On October 30, 2023, we resumed selling shares under the LPC Purchase Agreement. As of May 10, 2024, the Company has sold 100,408 shares for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $300,000 subsequent to March 31, 2024.

On January 24, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2024 Direct Offering Agreement”), with several investors relating to the issuance and sale of 1,371,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), in a registered direct offering, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 1,571,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Purchase Warrants”, and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants, the “Warrants”) in a concurrent private placement (the “Concurrent Private Offering” and together with the registered direct offering, the “2024 Direct Offering”). Our gross proceeds from the 2024 Direct Offering were approximately $5.6 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated expenses of $694,000 payable by us. 

The Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised on February 6, 2024 for $20.

The Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of $4.13 per share and will be exercisable beginning six months after issuance and will expire 5 years from the initial exercise date.

Effective upon the closing of the 2024 Direct Offering, the Company also amended certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 366,664 shares at an exercise price of $13.20 per share and a termination date of August 25, 2027, so that the 

 

25



 

amended warrants have a reduced exercise price of $4.13 per share and a new termination date of January 26, 2029. The other terms of the amended warrants remain unchanged.

As mentioned, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and we expect to continue to incur a net loss and negative cash flows from operations in 2023. At March 31, 2024 we had an accumulated deficit of $522,932,000 and stockholders’ deficit of $1,363,000. As of March 31, 2024, we had $3,413,000 of cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash of $260,000), $5,293,000 of current liabilities, and working capital of $829,000. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations. While we expect to grow revenue through Aspira Labs, there is no assurance of our ability to generate substantial revenues and cash flows from Aspira Labs’ operations. We expect revenue from our products to be our only material, recurring source of cash in 2023. 

Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including, among others:   

•resources devoted to sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;

•the rate of OvaSuite product adoption by physicians and patients; 

•the rate of product adoption by healthcare systems and large physician practices of the decentralized distribution agreements for OvaSuite;

•the insurance payer community’s acceptance of and reimbursement for our products;

•our plans to acquire or invest in other products, technologies and businesses; and

•the potential need to add study sites to access additional patients to maintain clinical timelines.

Net cash used in operating activities was $4,431,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulting primarily from the net loss reported of $4,629,000, which includes non-cash expenses in the amount of $382,000 related to changes in accounts payable, stock compensation expense of $362,000 and $55,000 related to changes in prepaid expense offset by changes in other liabilities of $254,000, $251,000 relating to a change in fair value of warrant fair value, changes in accounts receivable of $72,000 and changes in accrued liabilities of $66,000.

Net cash used in operating activities was $5,706,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, resulting primarily from the net loss reported of $6,578,000, which includes non-cash items in the amount of $582,000 related to changes in accrued liabilities, $396,000 related to stock compensation expense, changes in prepaid expense and other assets of $323,000 and $70,000 related to depreciation and amortization, offset by changes in accounts receivable of $309,000 and $216,000 relating to a change in other liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $20,000 and $8,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consisted of property and equipment purchases.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $5,269,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, stemming primarily from a registered direct offering resulting in net proceeds of $4,869,000, after deducting placement agent costs and other expenses of $694,000 and an equity line of credit offering of $400,000. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $55,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, stemming primarily from the at the market offering resulting from gross proceeds of $162,000, transaction-related offering costs of $132,000, in addition to principal payments on the DECD loan.

Based on the available objective evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Therefore, there was no deferred income tax expense or benefit for the period.

Our pre-2018 federal NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2023 through 2037, if not utilized, and can offset 100% of future taxable income for regular tax purposes. Any federal NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, can generally be carried forward indefinitely but such federal NOL carryforwards are permitted to be used in any taxable year to offset up to 80% of taxable income in such year. Portions of our state NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2023 through 2037 if not utilized. Our ability to use our NOLs during this period will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income, and the portions of our NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income.

Our ability to use our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income is restricted due to ownership change limitations that have occurred in the past, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”), as well as similar state provisions. Net operating losses which are limited from offsetting any future taxable income under Section 382 are not included in the gross deferred tax assets. Due to the existence of a valuation allowance, it is not expected that such limitations, if any, will have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Our unrecognized tax benefits attributable to research and development credits will increase during the period for tax positions taken during the year and will decrease for expiration of a portion of the carryforwards during the period.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Per Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, the information called for by this Item 3 is not required.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This was due to two material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting that were identified as of December 31, 2023 and disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report Form 10-K related to multiple deficiencies and a lack of timely operation of certain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure that continue to exist as of March 31, 2024.

Material Weaknesses

As previously reported, we identified material weaknesses related to:

•the operation of internal controls related to information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) that are used to process and record certain revenue and expense transactions and support our financial reporting processes. The internal control around ITGCs resulted in the lack of certain internal controls over these IT systems and over data and reports accumulated in such IT systems; and

•the design and implementation of our control activities over our revenue process. We did not adequately design controls to validate the delivery of the lab results to ordering physicians to ensure that revenue is being appropriately recognized. 

Remediation Activities 

In order to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, management is performing, with direction from the audit committee, the following remediation activities: 

•Retained an internal controls specialist to complement the skills of the existing accounting and financial reporting staff, as well as implement key controls to improve business processes, including revenue and the IT environment.

•Completed a preliminary process to identify all information technology applications that support the Company’s financial reporting processes and assess the risk of misstatement associated with each.

•Planned a comprehensive review of the design and performance of internal controls related to information technology applications, including user access and program change controls.

•Enhanced controls that require the assessment of service organization controls prior to implementation and on an annual basis.

•Retained additional accounting and financial reporting resources during the year-end close to improve our ability to perform our disclosure controls and procedures on a timely basis, particularly for certain significant, non-routine or complex transactions.

•Providing additional training and continuing education to accounting staff regarding SEC requirements and required disclosures under GAAP.

•Enhanced the design of and implementation of controls around the rigor of the review process, and retention of sufficient appropriate evidence over the revenue process.

Management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control environment, as well as policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

 

27



 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

As steps to remediate the material weaknesses discussed above, management has reviewed of the design and performance of internal controls related to information technology applications and enhanced the design of and implementation of controls around the rigor of its review and documentation process. Apart from these steps, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, there are no matters, as of March 31, 2024, that, in the opinion of management, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report”). The risks and uncertainties described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

 

We are currently offering and developing multiple tests as LDTs and intend to develop and perform LDTs at Aspira Labs in the future. FDA’s newly issued rule for LDTs, effective July 5, 2024, which will be phased in over a period of four years, will significantly change the regulatory landscape for LDTs. The final rule included a clause to grandfather in tests already in market on May 6, 2024, which applies to our current commercially available tests. The new rule may lead to additional compliance costs and may delay or prevent market entry for new or modified tests and may add a financial burden to us for future Aspira tests. There is a risk that the commercialization of these tests, and our results of operations and financial condition, will be negatively affected.  

The FDA considers an LDT to be a test that is designed, developed, validated, and used within a single, CLIA-certified high complexity laboratory. The FDA has historically taken the position that it has the authority to regulate LDTs as in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical devices under the FDC Act, but it has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to LDTs, meaning that most LDTs have not been subject to FDA oversight. On May 6, 2024, the FDA published a final rule amending the definition of an IVD device to include IVDs manufactured by a clinical laboratory. 

 The specific exception that applies to Aspira is the exception for currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs that were first marketed prior to the date of the issuance of this rule, May 6, 2024. The FDA intends for this policy to apply to currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs as long as they are not modified following the issuance of this final rule or are modified but only in certain limited ways that are described below:

1.	change the indications for use of the IVD;

2.	alter the operating principle of the IVD;

3.	include significantly different technology in the IVD or;

4.	adversely change the performance or safety specifications of the IVD.

The FDA intends to request that laboratories offering currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs submit labeling to FDA as provided in §807.26(e). Labeling includes IVD performance information and a summary of supporting validation, as applicable. This information will help FDA more closely monitor currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs and identify those that may lack analytical validity, clinical validity, or safety. As part of its review of labeling, the FDA also intends to look closely at claims of superior performance and whether those claims are adequately substantiated.

The final rule also announced the FDA’s intention to phase out its general enforcement discretion policy. Unless the rule is overturned by a court or Congress, the medical device requirements for most LDTs will be phased in beginning on May 6, 2025. These requirements include premarket authorization requirements (510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval (“PMA”)) for each LDT performed by the laboratory, and postmarket registration and listing, medical device reporting, correction, removal, and recall, complaint handling, labeling, investigational device, and quality system requirements. Certain categories of LDTs will be subject to enforcement discretion with respect to some or all of these requirements. For example, FDA will apply enforcement discretion to currently marketed LDTs that were first offered prior to May 6, 2024, with respect to most quality system requirements and the requirement for premarket authorization if they are not modified or modified in only limited ways. Laboratories performing these tests are subject to other requirements, including the requirement to submit the labeling for the LDT to FDA for review. FDA will similarly exercise enforcement discretion with respect to premarket authorization for LDTs approved by the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (“NYS-CLEP”).

Compliance with these additional regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and expensive, potentially diverting resources from other aspects of our business, and will potentially affect the sales of our products and how customers use our products and will require reevaluation of our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws. Moreover, failure to comply with these and other FDA regulations could result in legal actions, including fines and penalties. 

If we are unable to comply with FDA requirements, or to do so within the timeframes specified by the FDA, we may be forced to stop selling our tests or be required to modify claims or make such other changes while we update our processes. For existing or future tests subject to FDA clearance, approval or de novo classification, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected until such a review is completed and clearance, approval or de novo classification to market were obtained. There can be no assurance that any tests we develop will be cleared, approved or classified on a timely basis, if at all. Obtaining FDA clearance, approval or de novo classification for diagnostics can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and for higher-risk devices generally takes several years and requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations for those tests will increase the cost of conducting our business, significantly affect our operations, and could have a significant negative impact on our financial performance.

Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been previously introduced. In June 2021, Congress introduced the VALID Act, which would have established a new risk-based regulatory framework for in vitro clinical tests (“IVCTs”), a category which would have included IVDs, LDTs, collection devices and instruments used with such tests. This legislation was not enacted during that session of Congress, but was reintroduced in 2023. FDA’s new LDT final rule may renew attention to VALID and may lead to the introduction of new proposals to limit the FDA’s regulatory authority.
