Going Concern and Management’s Liquidity Plans

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $254,744 and a working capital deficit of $6,065,467. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,733,646 and $2,695,148, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $2,091,709 and $2,939,377, respectively.

Further, the Company’s convertible debt matured on February 21, 2024 and the Company has subsequently received event of default notices demanding immediate payment of all balances owed in connection with the convertible debt, including cash true up obligations.

                                                                   10

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(unaudited)

 

Since inception, the Company’s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings. The Company believes it has access to capital resources and continues to evaluate additional financing opportunities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations.

 

During April 2024, the Company sold a total of 16,667 shares of common stock pursuant to a private placement for gross proceeds of $100,000. During May 2024, the Company issued 120-day promissory notes in in the aggregate amount of $1,185,000, of which promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $925,000 were issued for cash, and a promissory note in the amount of $260,000 was issued satisfaction of a deposit for the purchase of equity. The notes bear interest at 8.5% per annum.

 

Based upon projected revenues and expenses, the Company believes that it may not have sufficient funds to operate for the next twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Highly Inflationary Status in Argentina

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded gains of $9,983 and $111,792 respectively, resulting from foreign currency remeasurement of the Company’s Argentine subsidiaries’ net monetary liability position of its Argentine subsidiaries.

 

Concentrations

 

The Company maintains cash with major financial institutions. Cash held in US bank institutions is currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000 at each institution. No similar insurance or guarantee exists for cash held in Argentina bank accounts. There were aggregate uninsured cash balances of $145,600 and $93,878 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represents cash held in Argentine bank accounts.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC Topic 606 provides a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and gains and losses arising from transfers of non-financial assets including sales of property and equipment, real estate, and intangible assets.

 

The Company earns revenues from the sale of real estate lots, as well as hospitality, food and beverage, other related services, and from the sale of clothing and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when and how revenue is recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of contract with customer; (ii) determination of performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

 

                                                                   11

          Total Revenues                                   $      587,378  $      447,767 

 

Revenue from the sale of food, wine, agricultural products, clothes and accessories is recorded when the customer obtains control of the goods purchased. Revenues from hospitality and other services are recognized as earned at the point in time that the related service is rendered, and the performance obligation has been satisfied. Revenues from gift card sales are recognized when the card is redeemed by the customer. The Company does not adjust revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed (“breakage”) due to the lack of historical data. Revenue from real estate lot sales is recorded when the lot is deeded, and legal ownership of the lot is transferred to the customer.

 

The timing of the Company’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. A receivable is recorded when revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. Deferred revenues associated with real estate lot sale deposits are recognized as revenues (along with any outstanding balance) when the lot sale closes, and the deed is provided to the purchaser. Other deferred revenues primarily consist of deposits accepted by the Company in connection with agreements to sell barrels of wine, advance deposits received for grapes and other agricultural products, and hotel deposits. Wine barrel and agricultural product advance deposits are recognized as revenues (along with any outstanding balance) when the product is shipped to the purchaser. Hotel deposits are recognized as revenue upon occupancy of rooms, or the provision of services. See Note 7, Deferred Revenue.

 

Contracts related to the sale of wine, agricultural products and hotel services have an original expected length of less than one year. The Company has elected not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations pertaining to contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, as permitted under the guidance.

 

                                                                   12

Net Loss per Common Share

 

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the impact of common shares, if dilutive, resulting from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible instruments.

 

The following securities are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:

Derivative Instruments

 

The Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record any bifurcated embedded features at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded in earnings each period as non-operating, non-cash income or expense. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. Bifurcated embedded features are recorded upon note issuance at their initial fair values which create additional debt discount to the host instrument.

 

                                                                   13

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures (Topic 280), which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses on both an annual and interim basis. The guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Since this new ASU addresses only disclosures, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have any material effects on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating any new disclosures that may be required upon adoption of ASU 2023-07.

 

3. MORTGAGES RECEIVABLE

 

The Company offers loans to purchasers in connection with the sale of real estate lots. The loans bear interest at 7.2% per annum and terms generally range from eight to ten years. Principal and interest for each loan is billed and receivable on a monthly basis. The loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on the property purchased by the borrower. Mortgages receivable include the related interest receivable and are presented at amortized cost, less bad debt allowances, in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Management evaluates each loan individually on a quarterly basis, to assess collectability and estimate a reserve for past due amounts. The total allowance for uncollectable mortgages are $1,465,595 and $1,436,981 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Past due principal amounts of $597,575 and $497,588 are included in mortgages receivable, current as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

5. INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or developed by the Company. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

 

Level 1 - Valued based on quoted prices at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities trading in active markets. Financial instruments in this category generally include actively traded equity securities.

 

Level 2 - Valued based on (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (d) from market corroborated inputs. Financial instruments in this category include certain corporate equities that are not actively traded or are otherwise restricted.

 

Level 3 - Valued based on valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs is not readily observable. Included in this category are certain corporate debt instruments, certain private equity investments, and certain commitments and guarantees.

 

                                                                   15

(unaudited)

 

The carrying amounts of the Company’s short-term financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid commissions on lot sales, prepaid taxes and expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s loans payable, debt obligations, convertible debt obligations and derivative liability approximate fair value, as they bear terms and conditions comparable to the market for obligations with similar terms and maturities.

 

6. ACCRUED EXPENSES

Overview

 

Gaucho Group Holdings, Inc. (“GGH” or the “Company”) positions its e-commerce leather goods, accessories, and fashion brand, Gaucho – Buenos Aires™, as one of luxury, creating a platform for the global consumer to access their piece of Argentine style and high-end products. With a concentration on leather goods, ready-to-wear and accessories, this is the luxury brand in which Argentina finds its contemporary expression. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company launched Gaucho Casa, a Home & Living line of luxury textiles and home accessories, which is being marketed and sold on the Gaucho – Buenos Aires e-commerce platform. Gaucho Casa challenges traditional lifestyle collections with its luxury textiles and home accessories rooted in the singular spirit of the gaucho aesthetic. GGH seeks to grow its direct-to-consumer online products to global markets in the United States, Asia, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Argentina. We intend to focus on e-commerce and scalability of the Gaucho – Buenos Aires and Gaucho Casa brands, as real estate in Argentina is politically sensitive. GGH’s goal is to become recognized as the LVMH (“Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy”) of South America’s leading luxury brands. Through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, GGH also owns and operates legacy investments in the boutique hotel, hospitality and luxury vineyard property markets. This includes a golf, tennis and wellness resort, as well as an award-winning wine production company concentrating on Malbecs and Malbec blends. Utilizing these wines as its ambassador, GGH seeks to further develop its legacy real estate, which includes developing residential vineyard lots located within its 4,138-acre resort.

 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated our corporate office lease and senior management now works remotely. GGH’s local operations are managed by professional staff with substantial hotel, hospitality and resort experience in Buenos Aires and San Rafael, Argentina.

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt has been raised as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company presently has enough cash on hand to sustain its operations on a month-to-month basis, but if the Company is not able to obtain additional sources of capital, it may not have sufficient funds to continue to operate the business for twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. Since inception, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings.

 

                                                                   28

 

 

Consolidated Results of Operations

 

Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023

 

Overview

 

We reported a net loss of approximately $2.7 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Revenues

 

Revenues from operations were approximately $587,000 and $448,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of approximately $139,000 or 31%. The overall increase in sales was driven by increases in lot sale revenues of approximately $104,000 in connection with the closing of the sale of one lot during the period, increase in hotel and restaurant revenues of approximately $226,000 resulting from increases in menu and room prices and occupancy rates, increase of approximately $139,000 in wine revenues as the result of new wine distribution channels, and an increase of approximately $47,000 in clothing and other revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $377,000 caused by the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

 

Gross profit

 

We generated a gross profit of approximately $220,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a gross profit of approximately $154,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase in gross profit of approximately $66,000 primarily resulting from the increase in lots sales and hotel and wine revenues, which did not result in incremental fixed costs associated with these business units, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from clothing results as the result of approximately $130,000 charged to cost of sales to write-down slow moving inventory.

 

Selling and marketing expenses

 

Selling and marketing expenses were approximately $96,000 and $235,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $139,000 or 59%, which consisted primarily of a $70,000 decrease in marketing expenses and a $69,000 decrease resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

 

General and administrative expenses

 

General and administrative expenses were approximately $2,265,000 and $1,757,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $508,000 or 29%. Increases of approximately $385,000 in legal and professional fees resulting from the filing of a complaint against the holder of the convertible note, extra special stockholder meetings, complex equity transactions and increased audit fees, as well as approximately $120,000 in compensation expense and $94,000 of expected credit losses, $106,000 in foreign taxes and approximately $317,000 in other aggregated expenses that are not individually material, were partially offset by decreases of approximately $513,000 resulting from the impact of the decline in the value of the Argentine peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

 

                                                                   29

 

 

Depreciation and amortization expense

 

Depreciation and amortization expense included in operating expenses was approximately $110,000 and $109,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Interest income

 

Interest income was approximately $15,000 and $50,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of $35,000 or 70%. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not recognize interest earned on past due mortgage receivable balances.

 

Interest expense

 

Interest expense was approximately $427,000 and $602,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $175,000 or 29%, resulting from the decrease in debt balances during the period.

 

Other income, related party

 

Other income was approximately $0 and $75,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income during the three months ended March 31, 2023 represented management fees from LVH. LVH suspended operations on September 27, 2023; accordingly, no management fees were earned during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Loss on extinguishment of debt

 

There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended March 31, 2023 in the aggregate amount of $383,987 is comprised of (i) premium paid on the conversion of GGH Notes of $112,065, (ii) premium paid on the cash redemption of GH Notes of $124,049, (iii) premium paid on the 2023 Notes for cash redemption of principal in the amount of $13,094, and (iv) the fair value of $134,779 in warrants issued in the exchange agreement for the GGH Notes in 2023.

 

Gains from foreign currency translation

 

The Company recorded net gains from foreign currency remeasurement of approximately $10,000 and $112,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $102,000 or 91%, due to the fluctuation in the Argentine peso to United States dollar exchange rates.

 

Change in fair value of derivative liability

 

The Company recorded a change in fair value of derivative liability of approximately $81,000 and $0 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 is associated with the derivative liability arising from the accrual of convertible debt interest during the period.

 

                                                                   30

 

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We measure our liquidity a variety of ways, including the following:

 

                                                                      March 31,           December 31,    

                                                                         2024                 2023        

Cash                                                              $          255,000   $          428,000 

Working capital deficiency                                        $        6,065,000   $        5,363,000 

Debt outstanding, gross principal amount                          $        1,787,000   $        1,874,000 

Cash true up obligations                                          $        1,485,000   $        1,485,000 

Lot sale obligations (gross principal amount, refundable upon     $          500,000   $          525,000 

 rescission)

 

Cash requirements for our current liabilities include approximately $5,038,000 for accounts payable and accrued expenses (including approximately $1,485,000 of cash true up obligations), approximately $1,596,000 for convertible debt principal outstanding, approximately $191,000 for loans payable, approximately $500,000 for lot sale obligations, approximately $266,000 for future payments under operating leases, and approximately $80,000 for other current liabilities. Further, our convertible debt matured on February 21, 2024 and we have subsequently received event of default notices demanding immediate payment of all balances owed in connection with the convertible debt, including cash true up obligations. Cash requirements for our long-term liabilities include approximately $1,008,000 future payments under operating leases and approximately $24,000 for accrued expenses.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we financed a portion of our activities from proceeds derived from equity financings. A significant portion of the funds have been used to cover working capital needs and costs related to the infrastructure of our real estate lots.

 

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to approximately $2,092,000 and $2,939,000, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $2,734,000, adjusted for approximately $942,000 of net non-cash expenses, and approximately $300,000 of cash used to fund changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $2,695,000, adjusted for approximately $969,000 of net non-cash expenses, and approximately $1,214,000) of cash used to fund changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.

 

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to approximately $46,000 and $50,000, respectively, resulting from the purchase of property and equipment.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to approximately $2,000,000 and $5,119,000, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from approximately $1,733,000 in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $380,000 of deposits for equity purchases, partially offset by approximately $87,000 in repayment of loans payable, and approximately $25,000 from the partial refund of a lot sale obligation. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from approximately $4,678,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of debt, $591,000 in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a private placement, approximately $441,000 in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the New ELOC and $185,000 in proceeds from the issuance of a note payable, partially offset by the repayment of convertible debt obligations of approximately $744,000 and repayment of loans payable of approximately $33,000.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and a working capital deficit of approximately $255,000 and $6,065,000, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of approximately $2.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of approximately $1.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Further, as of March 31, 2024, approximately $3.4 million owed in connection with the Company’s convertible debt (including principal, interest, redemption premiums and cash true up obligations) is past due and payable upon demand, and approximately $0.2 million represents the current portion of the Company’s loans payable which are payable on demand or for which payments are due within twelve months after March 31, 2024.

 

During May 2024, the Company issued 120-day promissory notes in in the aggregate amount of $1,185,000, of which promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $925,000 were issued for cash, and a promissory note in the amount of $260,000 was issued satisfaction of a deposit for the purchase of equity. The notes bear interest at 8.5% per annum.

 

The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Based upon projected revenues and expenses, the Company believes that it may not have sufficient funds to operate for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. Since inception, the Company’s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received from equity and debt financings. The Company believes it has access to capital resources and continues to evaluate additional financing opportunities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Availability of Additional Funds

 

As a result of our financings, we have been able to sustain operations. However, we will need to raise additional capital in order to meet our future liquidity needs for operating expenses and capital expenditures, including GGI inventory production, continued development of the GGI e-commerce platform, expansion of our winery and additional investments in real estate development. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

None.

 

Contractual Obligations

 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information requested by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.

 

                                                                   32

 

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which it relies are reasonably based upon information available to us at the time that it makes these estimates and judgments. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.

 

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company considers the valuation of credit losses surrounding mortgage receivables to be a critical accounting estimate due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

 

As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who is our Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, resulting from ineffective controls over information technology general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements with respect to user provisioning and deprovisioning and cybersecurity, a lack of segregation of duties due to our small size, and lack of testing of the operating effectiveness of the controls.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Inherent Limitations of Controls

 

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 

                                                                   33

 

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

On February 16, 2024, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging 3i, LP, 3i Management LLC, and Maier Joshua Tarlow (the “3i Parties”) engaged in an unlawful securities transaction with the Company as an unregistered dealer under U.S. securities laws.

 

On April 5, 2024, the 3i Parties filed their answer to the complaint including affirmative defenses and asserted four counterclaims against the Company: (i) breach of contract; (ii) request for preliminary injunction and permanent injunction; (iii) unjust enrichment; and (iv) restitution.

 

On April 26, 2024, the Company responded to the 3i Parties’ counterclaims by filing a partial motion to dismiss. The Company’s motion specifically seeks dismissal of the 3i Parties’ counterclaims for (i) preliminary and permanent injunction; (ii) unjust enrichment; and (iii) restitution.

 

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to litigation and arbitration claims incidental to its business. Such claims may not be covered by its insurance coverage, and even if they are, if claims against GGH and its subsidiaries are successful, they may exceed the limits of applicable insurance coverage. We are not involved in any litigation that we believe is likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. However, our current risk factors are set forth in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 30, 2024.

 

The Company is currently in default under its convertible promissory note with 3i, which allows the holder to redeem all or a portion of the Note and has received demand for payment.

 

Pursuant to the 2023 Purchase Agreement and Note, as of May 21, 2023, the Company failed to prepay, redeem or convert one quarter of the initial principal and interest on the Note. On August 11, 2023, the Company and 3i entered into an agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things: 3i agreed to forbear from issuing an event of default notice and event of default redemption notice through December 31, 2023. The maturity date of the Note was February 21, 2024. 3i has issued three separate written notices requiring the Company to redeem all or a portion of the 2023 Note, which if enforced, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The notices of default and demand for payment were issued by 3i on February 21, 2024, February 28, 2024, and March 6, 2024.

Each investor in the Private Placement has certain anti-dilution protections for a period of 18 months following each closing of the Private Placement. If, during the 18-month period following each closing of the Offering, the Company issues or sells any shares of common stock of the Company (a “Dilutive Issuance”), then each participant in the Private Placement will automatically be issued such number of shares of common stock as is necessary to maintain the percentage ownership that such participant would have had if the Dilutive Issuance had not occurred. With respect to the issuance of any securities to 3i pursuant to the 2023 Note Documents as a result of Dilutive Issuances, the participant shall not be entitled to any additional Dilutive Issuances beyond the initial Dilutive Issuance. Further, at such time that the participant disposes of its shares acquired in the Private Placement, all rights to any Dilutive Issuance shall cease.

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities

 

On February 21, 2024, the Company received an Event of Default Redemption Notice from 3i providing notice of Events of Default arising under the 2023 Note Documents and demanding immediate payment of the Event of Default Redemption Price equal to a minimum of $3,437,646.

 

On February 28, 2024, the Company received a second Event of Default Redemption Notice from 3i providing notice of an additional Event of Default arising under the 2023 Note Documents, and demanding immediate payment of the Event of Default Redemption Price equal to a minimum of $3,450,711.

 

On March 6, 2024, the Company received an Event of Default notice from 3i regarding an Event of Default arising under the 2023 Note Documents for failure to cure a Conversion Failure for a Conversion Notice submitted by 3i on February 20, 2024, and demanding immediate payment of the Event of Default Redemption Price equal to a minimum of $3,460,510.

 

All terms not defined herein shall refer to the defined terms in the 2023 Note Documents.

 

Upon an Event of Default, the interest rate on the outstanding principal will automatically be increased from 7% to 18% per annum, and 3i may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the 2023 Note at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (A) the amount to be redeemed multiplied by (B) the redemption premium of 115%, and (ii) the product of (X) the conversion rate in effect at such time as 3i delivers an Event of Default redemption notice, multiplied by (Y) the product of (1) the redemption premium of 115% multiplied by (2) the greatest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such Event of Default and ending on the date the Company makes the entire payment required to be made under the 2023 Note Documents.

 

Additionally, 3i may, at its option, convert the 2023 Note into shares of common stock of the Company at an alternate conversion price. The remedies provided in the 2023 Note are cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available to 3i at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief).

 

In addition to the remedies provided under the 2023 Note Documents, 3i also holds a security interest in all of the assets of the Company, including intellectual property and the Company’s ownership interests in each of its subsidiaries, pursuant to that certain Security and Pledge Agreement and Intellectual Property Security Agreement each dated February 21, 2023 (together, the “Security Agreement”). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the 2023 Note, the collateral agent appointed under the Security Agreement may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and may, among other things, (i) take absolute control of the collateral and receive, for the benefit of 3i, all payments made thereon, give all consents, waivers, and ratifications in respect thereof and otherwise act with respect thereto as through it were the outright owner thereof, (ii) require each grantor to make the collateral available to the collateral agent, and (iii) sell, lease, license, or dispose of the Collateral.

 

The Company believes that these Event of Default Redemption Notices from 3i are in response to the Company’s lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that 3i engaged in an unlawful securities transaction with the Company as an unregistered dealer under U.S. securities laws. 3i is considered a “dealer” within the meaning set forth in Section 3(a)(5)(A) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and, therefore, violated Section 15(a) by engaging in interstate securities transactions with the Company absent effective dealer registration. Because of 3i’s violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company is seeking to have certain contracts between it and 3i declared void and transactions effectuated thereunder rescinded pursuant to Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act. Please see our Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024.

 

                                                                   36
