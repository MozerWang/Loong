DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

​

Unless otherwise required by the context, in this report, the words “DISH DBS,” “DDBS,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to DISH DBS Corporation and its subsidiaries, “DISH Network” refers to DISH Network Corporation, our parent company, and its subsidiaries, including us, and “EchoStar” refers to EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, our ultimate parent company.

​

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our plans, objectives and strategies, growth opportunities in our industries and businesses, our expectations regarding future results, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, our estimates regarding the impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, and other trends and projections.  Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and may be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms.  These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and represent management’s current views and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control.  Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those summarized below:

​

SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to the Integration

      ●    Although we expect that the Merger will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be

            realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected timeframe, or at all, and risks associated

            with the foregoing may also result from any extended delay in the

            Integration.

Competition and Economic Risks

      ●    We face intense and increasing competition from providers of video, broadband and/or wireless services.  Changing consumer

            behavior and new technologies in our Pay-TV business may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers

            to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to

            us.



      ●    Our pay-TV competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs

            and/or offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to

            us.



      ●    If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, or at all, we may experience a decline

            in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business

            strategy.

Operational and Service Delivery Risks

      ●    Any deterioration in our operational performance, subscriber activations and churn rate and subscriber satisfaction could

            adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of

            operations.



      ●    We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our Pay-TV subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose

            access to certain programming, our Pay-TV subscriber activations and our subscriber churn rate may be negatively

            impacted.



      ●    We have limited satellite capacity and any failures or reduced capacity, caused by, among other things, operational and

            environmental risks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of

            operations.



      ●    Extreme weather may result in risk of damage to our infrastructure and therefore our ability to provide services, and may

            lead to changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which could materially and adversely affect

            our business, results of operations and financial

            condition.

      ●    We currently depend on DISH Network to provide the vast majority of our satellite transponder capacity and other related

            services to us.  Our business would be adversely affected if DISH Network ceases to provide these services to us and we

            are unable to obtain suitable replacement services from third

            parties.



      ●    We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us, and the

            inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.

            



      ●    We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a meaningful percentage of our

            total gross new subscriber

            activations.

Risks Related to our Human Capital

      ●    We rely on highly skilled personnel for our business, and any inability to hire and retain key personnel or to hire

            qualified personnel may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

            



      ●    Our business growth and customer retention strategies rely in part on the work of technically skilled employees.

Risks Related to our Products and Technology

      ●    Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of

            others.

            



      ●    We are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on

            our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual

            property.



      ●    If our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and

            network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our

            revenue.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity

      ●    We have experienced and may experience in the future consistent cyber-attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to

            our systems and any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems or those

            of third parties that we use in our operations could disrupt or harm our

            business.



      ●    The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our

            information technology and other enabling

            systems.

Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks

      ●    We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt and covenants in our Indentures could limit our ability

            to undertake certain types of activities and adversely affect our

            liquidity.



      ●    We may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, capital expenditures, the development, acquisition and launch of new satellites

            and other strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business, which may not be successful and we may lose a

            portion or all of our investment in these acquisitions and

            transactions.



      ●    Our parent, DISH Network, has made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related

            assets, and we have made and may continue to make funds available to DISH Network in the form of cash distributions or

            loans in connection with the development of DISH Network’s wireless

            business.



      ●    Our Senior Secured Notes (defined herein) are subordinated to our existing unsecured notes and certain future unsecured

            notes with respect to certain realizations under the Intercompany Loan (defined herein) and any collateral pledged as

            security

            therefor.



      ●    We will need additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund current obligations, to continue

            investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.

            



      ●    Our ultimate parent, EchoStar, is controlled by one principal stockholder, who is also our Chairman.

1.   Organization and Business Activities

​

Principal Business

​

DISH DBS Corporation (which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “DISH DBS,” “DDBS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our,” unless otherwise required by the context) is a holding company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network Corporation (“DISH Network”), our parent company.  DISH Network is a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”), our ultimate parent company, a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SATS.”  DISH DBS was formed under Colorado law in January 1996 and its common stock is held by DISH Orbital Corporation (“DOC”), a direct subsidiary of DISH Network.  Our subsidiaries operate one business segment, Pay-TV.

​

Pay-TV

​

We offer pay-TV services under the DISH® brand and the SLING® brand (collectively “Pay-TV” services).  The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) and Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations (“DISH TV”).  We also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers.  The SLING branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, multichannel, live-linear and on-demand streaming over-the-top (“OTT”) Internet-based domestic, international, Latino and Freestream video programming services (“SLING TV”).  As of March 31, 2024, we had 8.178 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 6.258 million DISH TV subscribers and 1.920 million SLING TV subscribers.

​

Recent Developments

​

Asset Transfer 

​

Concurrently with the issuance of the 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and using the proceeds thereof, we made the Intercompany Loan to DISH Network to be used by DISH Network to finance the purchase of certain wireless spectrum licenses and for general corporate purposes, including the buildout of wireless infrastructure.  The aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Loan was initially $5.250 billion, and on February 11, 2022, we advanced an additional $1.5 billion to DISH Network.  As of December 31, 2023, the receivable including capitalized paid in kind interest was $7.496 billion.  On January 10, 2024, we, in our capacity as “Lender” under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement related to the Intercompany Loan between DISH Network and us, have consummated the assignment pursuant to such terms, without any modification or amendment thereto, of our receivable in respect to the 2026 Tranche of $4.7 billion to DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.  DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C. has subsequently assigned its rights as lender thereunder to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable Company L.L.C., our ultimate parent, EchoStar’s direct wholly-owned subsidiary, such that amounts owed in respect of the 2026 Tranche will now be paid by DISH Network to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.  As of March 31, 2024, our total Intercompany Loan amount outstanding plus interest paid in kind was $2.799 billion, not including accrued interest receivable of $58 million, of which $28 million must be paid to us in cash.

​

Prior to January 10, 2024, we designated a newly formed subsidiary of DISH Network L.L.C. (the “DBS Subscriber Subsidiary”) as an unrestricted subsidiary.  DBS Subscriber Subsidiary holds approximately 3.0 million DISH TV subscribers immediately following the unrestricting of the entity.

​

EchoStar Merger with DISH Network

​

On December 31, 2023, EchoStar, our ultimate parent, completed the acquisition of DISH Network, our parent, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 2, 2023 (the “Amended Merger Agreement”), by and among EchoStar, EAV Corp., a Nevada corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and DISH Network, pursuant to which EchoStar acquired DISH Network by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and into DISH Network (the “Merger”), with DISH Network surviving the Merger as its wholly owned subsidiary. For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in EchoStar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

​

With the Merger complete, EchoStar is currently focused on the process of integrating its and DISH Network’s business in a manner that facilitates synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities and achieves other anticipated benefits (the “Integration”).

​

Future Capital Requirements

​

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

​

Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $278 million as of March 31, 2024 (“Cash on Hand”). As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024, we have $1.983 billion of debt maturing in November 2024.

​

Because we do not currently have committed financing to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, substantial doubt exists about our, our parent, DISH Network’s, and our ultimate parent, EchoStar’s, ability to continue as a going concern. We do not currently have the necessary Cash on Hand and/or projected future cash flows to fund the November 2024 debt maturity. To address our capital needs, we are in active discussions with funding sources to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing necessary for us to have sufficient liquidity. 

​

In addition, our parent, DISH Network, and our ultimate parent, EchoStar, may not be able to provide additional liquidity in the future.

​

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we not continue as a going concern.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

​

Basis of Presentation

​

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information.  Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required for complete financial statements prepared under GAAP.  In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Our results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

​

Principles of Consolidation

​

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries, investments in entities in which we have controlling influence and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary.  Minority interests are recorded as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests.  Non-consolidated investments are accounted for using the equity method when we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the investee.  When we do not have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of an investee, these equity securities are classified as either marketable investment securities or other investments, which will be initially recorded at cost, and based on observable market prices, will be adjusted to their fair value.  We record fair value adjustments in “Other, net” within “Other Income (Expense)” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

​

Use of Estimates

​

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense for each reporting period.  Estimates are based on historical experience, observable market inputs, and other reasonable assumptions in accounting for, among other things, allowances for credit losses (including those related to our installment billing programs), self-insurance obligations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, fair value of options granted under DISH Network’s stock-based compensation plans, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, inputs used to recognize revenue over time, including the relative standalone selling prices of performance obligations, finance leases, asset impairments, estimates of future cash flows used to evaluate and recognize impairments, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) on lease right of use assets, nonrefundable upfront fees, independent third-party retailer incentives, programming expenses and subscriber lives.  Economic conditions may increase the inherent uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions indicated above.  Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur.

​

Fair Value Measurements

​

We determine fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Market or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.  We apply the following hierarchy in determining fair value:

​

      ●    Level 1, defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;



      ●    Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar

            assets and liabilities in active markets; and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not

            active;

            and



      ●    Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, consistent with reasonably available

            assumptions made by other participants therefore requiring assumptions based on the best information

            available.

​

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable (net of allowance for credit losses) and current liabilities (excluding the “Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations”) was equal to or approximated fair value due to their short-term nature or proximity to current market rates. Fair values of our marketable investment securities are measured on a recurring basis based on a variety of observable market inputs.  For our investments in publicly traded equity securities and U.S. government securities, fair value ordinarily is determined based on Level 1 measurements that reflect quoted prices for identical securities in active markets.  Fair values of our investments in other marketable debt securities are generally based on Level 2 measurements as the markets for such debt securities are less active.  We consider trades of identical debt securities on or near the measurement date as a strong indication of fair value and matrix pricing techniques that consider par value, coupon rate, credit quality, maturity and other relevant features may also be used to determine fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities.   Additionally, we use fair value measurements from time to time in connection with other investments, asset impairment testing and the assignment of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities of acquired companies.  Those fair value measurements typically include significant unobservable inputs and are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are considered to occur at the beginning of the quarterly accounting period.  There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.  See Note 4 for the fair value of our marketable investment securities. 

​

Fair values for our publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices, when available.  The fair values of private debt are based on, among other things, available trade information, and/or an analysis in which we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information.  In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding, among other things, credit spreads, and the impact of these factors on the value of the debt securities.  See Note 7 for the fair value of our long-term debt.

Assets Recognized Related to the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 

​

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.  We have determined that certain sales incentive programs, including those with our independent third-party retailers, meet the requirements to be capitalized, and payments made under these programs are capitalized and amortized to expense over the estimated customer life or the contract term.  These amounts are capitalized in “Prepaids and other assets” and “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and then amortized in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

​

Advertising Costs

​

We recognize advertising expense when incurred as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Advertising expenses totaled $55 million and $86 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  

​

Research and Development

​

Research and development costs, not incurred in connection with customer requirements, are expensed as incurred and are included as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Research and development costs totaled $7 million and $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  

​

New Accounting Pronouncements

​

Joint Ventures. On August 23, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations — Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60) (“ASU 2023-05”), which requires an entity that qualifies as either a joint venture or a corporate joint venture as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) master glossary to apply a new basis of accounting upon the formation of the joint venture. This standard will be effective for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. A joint venture that was formed before January 1, 2025 may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively if it has sufficient information. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period in which financial statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-05 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

​

Segment Reporting. On November 27, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reporting Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will enhance financial reporting by providing additional information about a public company’s significant segment expenses and more timely and detailed segment information reporting throughout the fiscal period. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

​

Our parent, DISH Network, provides a centralized system for the management of our cash and marketable investment securities as it does for all of its subsidiaries to, among other reasons, maximize yield of the portfolio.  As a result, the cash and marketable investment securities included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are a component or portion of the overall cash and marketable investment securities portfolio included on DISH Network’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are managed by DISH Network.  We are reflecting the purchases and sales of marketable investment securities on a net basis for each period presented on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as we believe the net presentation is more meaningful to our cash flows from investing activities.

​

EchoStar Exchange Offer

​

On March 4, 2024, EchoStar commenced a tender offer to eligible employees to exchange eligible stock options for new options as detailed in its Schedule TO filed March 4, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Exchange Offer”), to, among other things, further align employee incentives with the current market.  The Exchange Offer expired on April 1, 2024 and EchoStar accepted for exchange approximately 7 million stock options.  As a result of the Exchange Offer, subsequent to March 31, 2024, the exercise price of approximately 3 million new stock options associated with our employees, affecting approximately 580 eligible employees, was adjusted to $14.04. The total incremental non-cash stock-based compensation expense resulting from the Exchange Offer is $9 million, which will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the applicable options.

(1)  Restricted marketable investment securities and restricted cash and cash equivalents are included in “Restricted cash, cash

      equivalents and marketable investment securities” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance

      Sheets.

​

Marketable Investment Securities

​

Our marketable investment securities portfolio may consist of debt and equity instruments.  All equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in “Other, net” within “Other Income (Expense)” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  All debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.  We report the temporary unrealized gains and losses related to changes in market conditions of marketable debt securities as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Stockholder’s Equity (Deficit),” net of related deferred income tax on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The corresponding changes in the fair value of marketable debt securities, which are determined to be company specific credit losses are recorded in “Other, net” within “Other Income (Expense)” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  

​

Current Marketable Investment Securities

​

Our current marketable investment securities portfolio can include investments in various debt instruments including, among others, commercial paper, corporate securities and United States treasury and/or agency securities.

Commercial paper consists mainly of unsecured short-term, promissory notes issued primarily by corporations with maturities ranging up to 365 days.  Corporate securities consist of debt instruments issued by corporations with various maturities normally less than 18 months.  U.S. Treasury and agency securities consist of debt instruments issued by the federal government and other government agencies.

​

Restricted Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Investment Securities

​

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our restricted marketable investment securities, together with our restricted cash and cash equivalents, included amounts required as collateral for our letters of credit and trusts.

​

Other Investments, net

​

We have strategic investments in certain debt and/or equity securities that are included in noncurrent “Other investments, net” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Our debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.  Generally, our debt investments in non-publicly traded debt instruments without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at amortized cost. Our equity investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  Certain of our equity method investments are detailed below. 

​

NagraStar L.L.C.  We own a 50% interest in NagraStar L.L.C. (“NagraStar”), a joint venture that is our primary provider of encryption and related security systems intended to assure that only authorized customers have access to our programming.  The three main technologies NagraStar provides to its customers are microchips, set-top box software, and uplink computer systems.  NagraStar also provides end-to-end platform security testing services.

​

Invidi Technologies Corporation.  We own a 35% interest in Invidi Technologies Corporation (“Invidi”), an entity that provides proprietary software for the addressable advertising market. Invidi contracts with multichannel video programming distributers to include its software in their respective set-top boxes and DVRs in order to deliver targeted advertisements based on a variety of demographic attributes selected by the advertisers. Invidi has also developed a cloud-based solution for internet protocol-based platforms.

​

Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in securities that are not publicly traded depends on, among other things, the success of the issuers’ businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital, on acceptable terms or at all, and to execute their business plans.  Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

Cost of sales and operating expense categories included in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) do not include depreciation and amortization expense related to satellites, equipment leased to customers or software.

​

Satellites

​

We currently utilize nine satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator, two of which we own and depreciate over their estimated useful life.  We currently utilize certain capacity on six satellites that we lease from DISH Network, which are accounted for as operating leases, except for Nimiq 5 which is accounted for as a finance lease and is depreciated over its economic life.  We also lease one satellite from a third-party:  the Anik F3 satellite, which is accounted for as an operating lease.  As of July 2023, we no longer lease the Ciel II satellite.

(1)  EchoStar XXV.  On March 20, 2023, DISH Network entered into a contract with Maxar Space LLC for the construction of EchoStar XXV,

      a DBS satellite that is capable of providing service to the continental United States (“CONUS”) and is intended to be used at the

      110 degree orbital location.  During the fourth quarter 2023, DISH Network entered into an agreement with Space Exploration

      Technologies Corp (“SpaceX”) for launch services for this satellite, which is expected to be launched during 2026.  The EchoStar

      XXV contract was transferred to EchoStar.  We plan to ultimately use this satellite for our Pay-TV

      segment.

EchoStar’s Spectrum and 5G Network Deployment

​

EchoStar has invested a total of over $30 billion in wireless spectrum licenses.  EchoStar’s wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements.  EchoStar plans to commercialize its wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of the nation’s first cloud-native, Open Radio Access Network (“O-RAN”) based 5G network (the “5G Network Deployment”).  EchoStar currently expects capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for its 5G Network Deployment to be approximately $10 billion, including amounts incurred in 2021, 2022, 2023 and the first three months of 2024.

​

EchoStar may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue its 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses.  Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly.  In addition, as EchoStar continues its 5G Network Deployment, EchoStar has and will continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration.  EchoStar may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to complete its 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers.

​

In connection with the development of EchoStar’s wireless business, including, without limitation, the efforts described above, we have made cash distributions and the Intercompany Loan to partially finance these efforts to date and may make additional cash distributions or loans to finance, in whole or in part, EchoStar’s future efforts, including, among other things, any potential Northstar re-auction payment and SNR re-auction payment.  There can be no assurance that EchoStar will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that EchoStar will be able to profitably deploy these wireless spectrum licenses.

​

We will need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, to among other things, continue investing in our business and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions.

​

See Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies – 5G Network Deployment” in the Notes to EchoStar’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 for further information.

Contingencies

​

Litigation

​

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business activities.  Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these proceedings seek an indeterminate amount of damages.  We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and to determine if accruals are appropriate.  If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss can be made.

​

For certain cases described on the following pages, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss because, among other reasons:  (i) the proceedings are in various stages; (ii) damages have not been sought; (iii) damages are unsupported and/or exaggerated; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties.  For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

ClearPlay, Inc.

​

On March 13, 2014, ClearPlay, Inc. (“ClearPlay”) filed a complaint against EchoStar and its wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network, DISH Network L.L.C., and EchoStar’s then wholly-owned subsidiary EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., in the United States District Court for the District of Utah.  The complaint alleges willful infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,898,799 (the “799 patent”), entitled “Multimedia Content Navigation and Playback”; 7,526,784 (the “784 patent”), entitled “Delivery of Navigation Data for Playback of Audio and Video Content”; 7,543,318 (the “318 patent”), entitled “Delivery of Navigation Data for Playback of Audio and Video Content”; 7,577,970 (the “970 patent”), entitled “Multimedia Content Navigation and Playback”; and 8,117,282 (the “282 patent”), entitled “Media Player Configured to Receive Playback Filters From Alternative Storage Mediums.”  ClearPlay alleges that the AutoHop™ feature of our Hopper® set-top box infringes the asserted patents.  On February 11, 2015, the case was stayed pending various third-party challenges before the United States Patent and Trademark Office regarding the validity of certain of the patents asserted in the action.  

​

In those third-party challenges, the United States Patent and Trademark Office found that all claims of the 282 patent are unpatentable, and that certain claims of the 784 patent and 318 patent are unpatentable.  ClearPlay appealed as to the 784 patent and the 318 patent, and on August 23, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the findings of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  On October 31, 2016, the stay was lifted, and in May 2017, ClearPlay agreed to dismiss DISH Network and EchoStar and DISH Network as defendants, leaving DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. as the sole defendants.  

​

On October 16, October 21, November 2, 2020 and November 9, 2020, DISH Network L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office requesting ex parte reexamination of the validity of the asserted claims of, respectively, the 784 patent, the 799 patent, the 318 patent and the 970 patent; and on November 2, November 20, December 14 and December 15, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted each request for reexamination.  On May 7, 2021, May 25, 2021, June 25, 2021 and July 7, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued Ex Parte Reexamination Certificates confirming the patentability of the challenged claims of, respectively, the 799 patent, the 784 patent, the 318 patent and the 970 patent.

​

In October and November 2021, DISH Network L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office requesting ex parte reexamination of the validity of certain asserted claims of the 784 patent, the 799 patent and the 970 patent.  In November and December, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted review of the challenged claims of the 799 patent and the 970 patent, but denied review of the challenged claims of the 784 patent.  On January 24, 2022, an examiner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office affirmed the challenged claims of the 799 patent, and on January 19, 2023, an examiner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office affirmed the challenged claims of the 970 patent.

​

In an order dated January 31, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part DISH Network L.L.C.’s and DISH Technologies L.L.C.’s motion for summary judgment.  Thereafter, ClearPlay narrowed its case to three asserted claims:  one under the 799 patent and two under the 970 patent.  Following a two-week trial, on March 10, 2023, the jury returned a verdict that DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. infringed each of the asserted patent claims (though not willfully), and awarded damages of $469 million.  That verdict became moot on March 21, 2023, when the trial court indicated that it would grant DISH Network L.L.C.’s and DISH Technologies L.L.C.’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, thus effectively vacating the jury award.  On June 2, 2023, the Court entered its formal order granting judgment as a matter of law.  On December 12, 2023, the Court denied ClearPlay’s motion to alter or amend the judgment.  ClearPlay has filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

​

We intend to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Data Breach Class Actions

​

On May 9, 2023, Susan Owen-Brooks, an alleged customer, filed a putative class action complaint against DISH Network, our parent, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  She purports to represent a nationwide class of all individuals in the United States who allegedly had private information stolen as a result of the February 23, 2023 Cyber-security Incident (and a North Carolina statewide subclass of the same individuals).  On behalf of the nationwide class, she alleges claims for contractual breaches, negligence and unjust enrichment (and, on behalf of the North Carolina subclass only, violation of the North Carolina Deceptive Trade Practices Act), and seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment.  Since that filing, ten additional putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, purporting to represent the same nationwide class of people, and Owen-Brooks has filed an amended complaint.  On August 2, 2023, the Court issued an order consolidating the first ten cases (the eleventh was dismissed) and, on November 16, 2023 and January 16, 2024, the plaintiffs filed consolidated amended class action complaints.

​

DISH Network intends to vigorously defend this case.  DISH Network cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Digital Broadcasting Solutions, LLC 

​

On August 29, 2022, Digital Broadcasting Solutions, LLC filed a complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,929,710 (the “710 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 9,538,122 (the “122 patent”), each entitled “System and method for time shifting at least a portion of a video program.”  Generally, the plaintiff contends that the AutoHop feature of our Hopper® set-top boxes infringes the asserted patents.  On June 21, 2023, the Court granted the motion of DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. to have the case transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  

​

In May 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of all claims of the 710 patent and the 122 patent and, on December 11, 2023, the United States Patent and Trademark Office entered decisions instituting each petition.  On May 9, 2024, a magistrate judge issued an order granting the defendants’ motion to stay the case pending the petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any related appeals.

​

Entropic Communications, LLC (first action)

​

On March 9, 2022, Entropic Communications, LLC (“Entropic”) filed a complaint against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and Dish Network Service L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,130,576 (the “576 patent”), entitled “Signal Selector and Combiner for Broadband Content Distribution”; U.S. Patent No. 7,542,715 (the “715 Patent”), entitled “Signal Selector and Combiner for Broadband Content Distribution”; and U.S. Patent No. 8,792,008 (the “008 Patent”), entitled “Method and Apparatus for Spectrum Monitoring.” On March 30, 2022, Entropic filed an amended complaint alleging infringement of the same patents. Generally, the plaintiff accuses satellite antennas, low-noise block converters, signal selector and combiners, and set-top boxes and the manner in which they process signals for satellite television customers of infringing the asserted patents. On October 24, 2022, this case was ordered to be transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A companion case against DirecTV was also ordered transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

​

In January and February of 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and Dish Network Service L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of all claims of the 715 patent, all claims of the 008 patent, and 25 claims of the 576 patent, which includes all of its asserted claims.  In August and September 2023, the Patent Office denied institution on the petitions challenging the 715 patent and the 576 patent.  In September 2023, at the parties’ joint request, the Patent Office dismissed the petition challenging the 008 patent, as Entropic agreed to drop its claims against DISH Network on that patent.

Entropic Communications, LLC (second action)

​

On February 10, 2023, Entropic filed a second lawsuit against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C., Dish Network Service L.L.C. and Dish Network California Service Corporation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,295,518 (the “518 patent”), entitled “Broadband network for coaxial cable using multi-carrier modulation”; U.S. Patent No. 7,594,249 (the “249 patent”), entitled “Network interface device and broadband local area network using coaxial cable”; U.S. Patent Nos. 7,889,759 (the “759 patent”), entitled “Broadband cable network utilizing common bit-loading”; U.S. Patent No. 8,085,802 (the “802 Patent”), entitled “Multimedia over coaxial cable access protocol”; U.S. Patent No. 9,838,213 (the “213 patent”), entitled “Parameterized quality of service architecture in a network”; U.S. Patent No. 10,432,422 (the “422 patent”), entitled “Parameterized quality of service architecture in a network”; U.S. Patent No. 8,631,450 (the “450 patent”), entitled “Broadband local area network”; U.S. Patent No. 8,621,539 (the “539 patent”), entitled “Physical layer transmitter for use in a broadband local area network”; U.S. Patent No. 8,320,566 (the “0,566 patent”), entitled “Method and apparatus for performing constellation scrambling in a multimedia home network”; U.S. Patent No. 10,257,566 (the “7,566 patent”), entitled “Broadband local area network”; U.S. Patent No. 8,228,910 (the “910 Patent”), entitled “Aggregating network packets for transmission to a destination mode”; and U.S. Patent No. 8,363,681 (the “681 patent”), entitled “Method and apparatus for using ranging measurements in a multimedia home network.”  Generally, the patents relate to Multimedia over Coax Alliance standards and the manner in which we provide a whole-home DVR network over an on-premises coaxial cable network.  Entropic has asserted the same patents in the same court against Comcast, Cox and DirecTV.  On September 7, 2023, the Court granted the motion of DISH Network L.L.C., Dish Network Service L.L.C. and Dish Network California Service Corporation to dismiss the claims arising from the 7,566 patent and the 910 patent on the grounds that they claimed in eligible subject matter.  In January and February 2024, DISH Network L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of the 249 patent, the 518 patent, the 759 patent, the 450 patent, the 539 patent, the ’0,566 patent, and the ’681 patent.

Freedom Patents

​

On April 7, 2023, Freedom Patents LLC filed a complaint against DISH Network and our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and Dish Network Service L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,284,686 (the “686 Patent”), entitled “Antenna/Beam Selection Training in MIMO Wireless LANS with Different Sounding Frames”; U.S. Patent No. 8,374,096 (the “096 Patent”), entitled “Method for Selecting Antennas and Beams in MIMO Wireless LANs”; and U.S. Patent No. 8,514,815 (the “815 Patent”), entitled “Training Signals for Selecting Antennas and Beams in MIMO Wireless LANs.”  Similar complaints were also filed against Acer, Altice, Charter, Comcast and Verizon.  In general, the asserted patents relate to the 802.11 wireless standard, and the products accused of infringement are the Wireless Joey, its access point, and certain Ring, Nest and Linksys products that we sell.  On March 15, 2024, the Court denied the defendants’ motion to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  The parties have reached a settlement under which DISH Network, DISH Network L.L.C. and Dish Network Service L.L.C. will pay a non-material sum in exchange for dismissal of the litigation and a license to the asserted patents.

Jones 401(k) Litigation

​

On December 20, 2021, four former employees filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against DISH Network, DISH Network’s Board of Directors, and DISH Network’s Retirement Plan Committee alleging fiduciary breaches arising from the management of our 401(k) Plan.  The putative class, comprised of all participants in the Plan on or after January 20, 2016, alleges that the Plan had excessive recordkeeping and administrative expenses and that it maintained underperforming funds.  On February 1, 2023, a Magistrate Judge issued a recommendation that the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint be granted, and on March 27, 2023, the district court judge granted the motion.  As permitted by the Court’s order, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 10, 2023, which is limited to allegations regarding the alleged underperformance of the Fidelity Freedom Funds.  On November 7, 2023, a Magistrate Judge issued a recommendation that the defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint be denied as to the duty to prudently monitor fund performance, but be granted as to the duty of loyalty and, on November 27, 2023, the district court judge entered an order adopting the recommendation.  On April 30, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to certification of the proposed plaintiff class.

Lingam Securities Class Action (formerly Jaramillo)

​

On March 23, 2023, a securities fraud class action complaint was filed against DISH Network and Messrs. Ergen, Carlson and Orban in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  The complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of DISH Network’s securities during the February 22, 2021 to February 27, 2023 class period.  In general, the complaint alleges that DISH Network’s public statements during that period were false and misleading and contained material omissions, because they did not disclose that we allegedly maintained a deficient cyber-security and information technology infrastructure, were unable to properly secure customer data and our operations were susceptible to widespread service outages.

​

In August 2023, the Court appointed a new lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff’s counsel, and on October 20, 2023, they filed an amended complaint that abandoned the original allegations.  In their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that, during the class period, the defendants concealed problems concerning the 5G network buildout that prevented scaling and commercializing the network to obtain enterprise customers.  The amended complaint adds as individual defendants James S. Allen, our Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; John Swieringa, DISH Network’s President, Technology and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Mayo, DISH Network’s former Executive Vice President of Network Development; Marc Rouanne, DISH Network’s former Executive Vice President and Chief Network Officer; and Stephen Bye, DISH Network’s former Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.  After the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint, asserting the same theory, on February 23, 2024.  The new complaint drops Erik Carlson, John Swieringa, Paul Orban and James Allen as individual defendants.

Realtime Data LLC and Realtime Adaptive Streaming LLC

​

On June 6, 2017, Realtime Data LLC d/b/a IXO (“Realtime”) filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Original Texas Action”) against EchoStar, DISH Network; our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C. (then known as EchoStar Technologies L.L.C.), Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C.; and EchoStar’s wholly-owned subsidiary Hughes Network Systems, L.L.C. (“HNS”); and Arris Group, Inc. Realtime’s initial complaint in the Original Texas Action, filed on February 14, 2017, had named only EchoStar and HNS as defendants.  

​

The amended complaint in the Original Texas Action alleges infringement of United States Patent No. 8,717,204 (the “204 patent”), entitled “Methods for encoding and decoding data”; United States Patent No. 9,054,728 (the “728 patent”), entitled “Data compression systems and methods”; United States Patent No. 7,358,867 (the “867 patent”), entitled “Content independent data compression method and system”; United States Patent No. 8,502,707 (the “707 patent”), entitled “Data compression systems and methods”; United States Patent No. 8,275,897 (the “897 patent”), entitled “System and methods for accelerated data storage and retrieval”; United States Patent No. 8,867,610 (the “610 patent”), entitled “System and methods for video and audio data distribution”; United States Patent No. 8,934,535 (the “535 patent”), entitled “Systems and methods for video and audio data storage and distribution”; and United States Patent No. 8,553,759 (the “759 patent”), entitled “Bandwidth sensitive data compression and decompression.”

(alleging infringement of the 897 patent, the 610 patent and the 535 patent) from the Original Texas Action into a separate action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Second Texas Action”).  On August 31, 2017, Realtime dismissed the claims against DISH Network, Sling TV L.L.C., Sling Media Inc., and Sling Media L.L.C. from the Second Texas Action and refiled these claims (alleging infringement of the 897 patent, the 610 patent and the 535 patent) against Sling TV L.L.C., Sling Media Inc., and Sling Media L.L.C. in a new action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (the “Colorado Action”).  Also on August 31, 2017, Realtime dismissed DISH Technologies L.L.C. from the Original Texas Action, and on September 12, 2017, added it as a defendant in an amended complaint in the Second Texas Action.  On November 6, 2017, Realtime filed a joint motion to dismiss the Second Texas Action without prejudice, which the Court entered on November 8, 2017.

​

On October 10, 2017, Realtime Adaptive Streaming LLC (“Realtime Adaptive Streaming”) filed suit against our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C., as well as Arris Group, Inc., in a new action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Third Texas Action”), alleging infringement of the 610 patent and the 535 patent.  Also on October 10, 2017, an amended complaint was filed in the Colorado Action, substituting Realtime Adaptive Streaming as the plaintiff instead of Realtime, and alleging infringement of only the 610 patent and the 535 patent, but not the 897 patent.  On November 6, 2017, Realtime Adaptive Streaming filed a joint motion to dismiss the Third Texas Action without prejudice, which the court entered on November 8, 2017.  Also on November 6, 2017, Realtime Adaptive Streaming filed a second amended complaint in the Colorado Action, adding our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C., as well as Arris Group, Inc., as defendants.

​

As a result, neither DISH Network nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in the Original Texas Action; the Court has dismissed without prejudice the Second Texas Action and the Third Texas Action; and our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C. as well as Arris Group, Inc., are defendants in the Colorado Action, which now has Realtime Adaptive Streaming as the named plaintiff.  Following settlements with the plaintiff, EchoStar and HNS were dismissed from the Original Texas Action in February 2019, and Arris Group, Inc. was dismissed from the Colorado Action in March 2021.

On July 3, 2018, Sling TV L.L.C., Sling Media L.L.C., DISH Network L.L.C., and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of each of the asserted patents.  On January 31, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to institute proceedings on DISH Network’s petitions, and it held trial on the petitions on December 5, 2019.  On January 17, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office terminated the petitions as time-barred, but issued a final written decision invalidating the 535 patent to third parties that had timely joined in DISH Network’s' petition (and, on January 10, 2020, issued a final written decision invalidating the 535 patent in connection with a third party’s independent petition).  On March 16, 2020, Sling TV L.L.C., Sling Media L.L.C., DISH Network L.L.C., and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed a notice of appeal from the terminated petitions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  On June 29, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office filed a notice of intervention in the appeal.  On March 16, 2021, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  On April 29, 2021, Sling TV L.L.C., Sling Media L.L.C., DISH Network L.L.C., and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied on June 28, 2021.  On January 12, 2021, Realtime Adaptive Streaming filed a notice of dismissal of its claims on the 535 patent.  

​

On July 30, 2021, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C., holding that the remaining asserted patent, the 610 patent, is invalid because it claims patent-ineligible abstract subject matter.  Realtime Adaptive Streaming appealed that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and on May 11, 2023, that Court affirmed the District Court’s summary judgment order.  Independently, on September 21, 2021, in connection with an ex parte reexamination of the validity of the 610 patent, an examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a final office action rejecting each asserted claim of the 610 patent as invalid over the cited prior art.  On April 19, 2023, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board rejected Realtime Adaptive Streaming’s appeal and affirmed the examiner’s rejection of the asserted claims of the 610 patent.  Realtime did not further appeal the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s determination and, thus, the asserted claims of the 610 patent were canceled.  As a result, DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C. no longer face any possible exposure from this matter, and the liability phase of this case is concluded.  

​

On January 21, 2022, the District Court granted the motion by DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C. and Sling Media L.L.C. to have the case declared “exceptional,” and on September 20, 2022, awarded them $3.9 million in attorneys’ fees.  Realtime Adaptive Streaming filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from the exceptionality and fee award orders, and that court heard oral argument on April 2, 2024.

SafeCast Limited

​

On June 27, 2022, SafeCast Limited filed a complaint against DISH Network in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  The complaint alleges that DISH Network infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,392,302, entitled “System for providing improved facilities in time-shifted broadcasts” (the “302 patent”).  On the same day, it brought complaints in the same court asserting infringement of the same patent against AT&T, Google, HBO, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Verizon.  On October 24, 2022, in response to the parties’ joint motion, the Court ordered the case against DISH Network transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  On December 1, 2022, SafeCast filed an amended complaint naming our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. as defendants and withdrawing the allegations as to DISH Network.  On June 22, 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed a petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of the asserted claims of the 302 patent.  On August 28, 2023, the Court stayed the case pending resolution of the petition. 

​

DISH Network intends to vigorously defend this case.  In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patent, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers.  We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.  The plaintiff is an entity that seeks to license a patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.

Sound View Innovations, LLC

​

On December 30, 2019, Sound View Innovations, LLC filed one complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiaries DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. and a second complaint against our wholly-owned subsidiary Sling TV L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  The complaint against DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. alleges infringement of United States Patent No 6,502,133 (the “133 patent”), entitled “Real-Time Event Processing System with Analysis Engine Using Recovery Information” and both complaints allege infringement of United States Patent No. 6,708,213 (the “213 patent), entitled “Method for Streaming Multimedia Information Over Public Networks”; United States Patent No. 6,757,796 (the “796 patent”), entitled “Method and System for Caching Streaming Live Broadcasts transmitted Over a Network”; and United States Patent No. 6,725,456 (the “456 patent”), entitled “Methods and Apparatus for Ensuring Quality of Service in an Operating System.”  All but the 133 patent are also asserted in the complaint against Sling TV L.L.C.

On May 21, 2020, June 3, 2020, June 5, 2020 and July 10, 2020, DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Technologies L.L.C. and Sling TV L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of, respectively, the 213 patent, the 133 patent, the 456 patent and the 796 patent.  On November 25, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office declined to review the validity of the 213 patent, and on September 29, 2021, denied a request for rehearing of that decision.  On January 19, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to institute proceedings on the 456 patent but declined to review the 133 patent.  On February 24, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to institute proceedings on the 796 patent.  On January 18, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a final written decision holding that the challenged claim of the 456 patent is patentable, and on February 8, 2022, it issued a final written decision holding that the challenged claims of the 796 patent are patentable.

The appeal on the 456 patent was voluntarily dismissed on December 6, 2022.

In its complaint, the Trustee contends that certain intracompany asset transfers in January 2024 breached the Indentures for those Notes, and that the transfers were intentional and constructive fraudulent transfers under the Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. The Trustee seeks a declaratory judgment that DISH DBS Corporation breached the Indentures and that an Event of Default occurred under the DBS Indentures. It further asks the Court to unwind certain intracompany asset transfers and to award damages.  On May 13, 2024, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Vermont National Telephone Company

​

On September 23, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed a qui tam complaint that, on May 13, 2015, Vermont National Telephone Company (“Vermont National”) filed against DISH Network; DISH Network’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, American AWS-3 Wireless I L.L.C., American II, American III, and DISH Wireless Holding L.L.C.; Charles W. Ergen (EchoStar’s Chairman) and Cantey M. Ergen (a member of EchoStar’s Board of Directors); Northstar Wireless; Northstar Spectrum; Northstar Manager, LLC; SNR Wireless; SNR HoldCo; SNR Wireless Management, LLC; and certain other parties.  The complaint alleges violations of the federal civil False Claims Act (the “FCA”) based on, among other things, allegations that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless falsely claimed bidding credits of 25% in the AWS-3 Auction when they were allegedly under the de facto control of DISH Network and, therefore, were not entitled to the bidding credits as designated entities under applicable FCC rules.  Vermont National participated in the AWS-3 Auction through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VTel Wireless.  The complaint was unsealed after the United States Department of Justice notified the District Court that it had declined to intervene in the action.  Vermont National seeks to recover on behalf of the United States government approximately $10 billion, which reflects the $3.3 billion in bidding credits that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless claimed in the AWS-3 Auction, trebled under the FCA.  Vermont National also seeks civil penalties of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 for each violation of the FCA.  On March 2, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a stay of the litigation until such time as the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (the “D.C. Circuit”) issued its opinion in SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC, et al. v. F.C.C. The D.C. Circuit issued its opinion on August 29, 2017 and remanded the matter to the FCC for further proceedings.  

​

Thereafter, the District Court maintained the stay until October 26, 2018.  On February 11, 2019, the District Court granted Vermont National’s unopposed motion for leave to file an amended complaint.  On March 28, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss Vermont National’s amended complaint, and on March 23, 2021, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  On April 21, 2021, Vermont National filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and, on May 17, 2022, that court reversed the District Court’s dismissal of the complaint.  On June 16, 2022, the Defendants-Appellees filed a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, but on August 17, 2022, that petition was denied.  On August 25, 2023, the FCC provided a sworn declaration stating that “the FCC considers SNR and Northstar to have fully and timely satisfied their obligations to pay money to the Government arising from the AWS-3 Auction.”  On that basis, on September 22, 2023, the Defendants filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment of no damages.  On September 26, 2023, the Court denied the motion as premature. On March 8, 2024, the United States filed a motion to exercise its statutory prerogative to intervene in the case for the purpose of moving to dismiss it with prejudice, stating that the case is “unlikely to vindicate the United States’ interests and would needlessly expend the Government’s and this Court’s resources.”

​

DISH Network intends to vigorously defend this case.  DISH Network cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of this proceeding or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

​

Other

​

In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees.  In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

“Notes Receivable - DISH Network”

​

Concurrently with the issuance of the 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (our “Senior Secured Notes”) and using the proceeds thereof, we made the Intercompany Loan to DISH Network to be used by DISH Network to finance the purchase of certain wireless spectrum licenses and for general corporate purposes, including the buildout of wireless infrastructure.  The Intercompany Loan is secured by:  (i) the cash proceeds of the loan; and (ii) an interest in the wireless spectrum licenses acquired using such proceeds.  Such collateral may be replaced by other then-existing wireless spectrum licenses held directly or indirectly by DISH Network of equivalent value (based upon a third-party valuation).  The Intercompany Loan will mature in two tranches, with the first tranche maturing on December 1, 2026 (the “2026 Tranche”) and the second tranche maturing on December 1, 2028 (the “2028 Tranche”).  The aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Loan was initially $5.250 billion, and on February 11, 2022, we advanced an additional $1.5 billion to DISH Network under the 2026 Tranche.  Interest accrues and is payable semiannually, and interest payments with respect to the Intercompany Loan are, at DISH Network’s option, payable in kind for the first two years.  In the third year, beginning November 2023, a minimum of 50% of each interest payment due with respect to each tranche of the Intercompany Loan must be paid in cash.  Thereafter, beginning in November 2024, interest payments must be paid in cash.  Interest accrues:  (a) when paid in cash, at a fixed rate of 0.25% per annum in excess of the interest rate applicable to, in the case of the 2026 Tranche, the 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, and in the case of the 2028 Tranche, the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (each, the “Cash Accrual Rate” with respect to the applicable tranche); and (b) when paid in kind, at a rate of 0.75% per annum in excess of the Cash Accrual Rate for the applicable tranche.

​

The Intercompany Loan is repayable by DISH Network in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon.  We may use the proceeds of any such pre-payment for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of indebtedness, but may not use any such prepaid amounts to make a cash dividend or distribution to DISH Network prior to the repayment in full of the Intercompany Loan.  The 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 are subordinated to our existing and certain future unsecured notes with respect to certain realizations under the Intercompany Loan and any collateral pledged as security therefor.  Any material amendments or modifications to the terms of the Intercompany Loan will require the written consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028.

​

As of December 31, 2023, the receivable including capitalized paid in kind interest was $7.496 billion.  On January 10, 2024, we, in our capacity as “Lender” under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement related to the Intercompany Loan between DISH Network and us, have consummated the assignment pursuant to such terms, without any modification or amendment thereto, of our receivable in respect to the 2026 Tranche of $4.7 billion to DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.  DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C. has subsequently assigned its rights as lender thereunder to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable Company L.L.C., our ultimate parent, EchoStar’s direct wholly-owned subsidiary, such that amounts owed in respect of the 2026 Tranche will now be paid by DISH Network to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.

​

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $50 million and $111 million, respectively, of “Interest income” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, “Notes receivable – DISH Network” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $2.799 billion and $7.496 billion, respectively, including interest paid in kind, respectively.  In addition, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, “Interest receivable – DISH Network” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $58 million ($28 million which must be paid in cash and $30 million which may be paid in kind), and $37 million ($18 million which must be paid in cash and $19 million which may be paid in kind), respectively.  

​

“Prepaids and Other Assets”

During the first quarter of 2024, we prepaid $50 million related to taxes payable to DISH Network and $52 million related to satellite capacity leased from DISH Network and recorded these in “Prepaids and other assets” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

​

“Cost of services”

​

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses of $52 million and $50 million, respectively, for satellite capacity leased from DISH Network, and telemetry, tracking and control (“TT&C”) and other professional services provided to us by DISH Network.  DISH Network is a supplier of the vast majority of our transponder capacity.  These amounts are recorded in “Cost of services” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The agreements pertaining to these expenses are discussed below.

​

Satellite Capacity Leased from DISH Network.  We lease satellite capacity on satellites owned or leased by DISH Network from a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network.  See “Satellites” in Note 6 for further information.  The term of each lease is set forth below:

​

      ●    EchoStar X, XI, XIV and XVI.  We lease all available capacity on the EchoStar X, XI, XIV and XVI satellites from a

            wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network.  The term of each satellite capacity agreement generally terminates upon the

            earlier of:  (i) the end-of-life of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails; or (iii) a certain date, which

            depends upon, among other things, the estimated useful life of the satellite.  We generally have the option to renew each

            satellite capacity agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end of the respective satellite’s life..

            

​

      ●    EchoStar XXIII.  On March 1, 2023, we began leasing certain capacity on the EchoStar XXIII satellite from a wholly-owned

            subsidiary of DISH Network on a month to month basis.

             

​

      ●    Nimiq 5.  DISH Network has a 15-year satellite service agreement with Telesat Canada (“Telesat”) to receive service on all

            32 DBS transponders on the Nimiq 5 satellite at the 72.7 degree orbital location with the option to renew on a

            year-to-year basis through the end-of-life of the Nimiq 5 satellite.  We are receiving transponder service on on all 32 of

            the DBS transponders on this satellite from DISH Network and have exercised our option to renew for a one-year period

            through September 2024.  As discussed in Note 6, “Property and Equipment,” the Nimiq 5 satellite lease is accounted for as

            a finance lease.  Expenses related to this lease are recorded in “Depreciation and amortization” and “Interest expense,

            net of amounts capitalized” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

             During each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $9 million of “Depreciation and amortization”

            expense and $1 million and $2 million of “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized,” respectively, related to Nimiq 5.

             

​

TT&C Agreement.  We receive TT&C services from a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network for certain satellites (the “TT&C Agreement”).  In February 2018, we amended the TT&C Agreement to, among other things, extend the term for one-year with four automatic one-year renewal periods.  The fees for services provided under the TT&C Agreement are calculated at either:  (i) a fixed fee; or (ii) cost plus a fixed margin, which vary depending on the nature of the services provided.  We and EchoStar are able to terminate the TT&C Agreement for any reason upon 12 months’ notice.  

​

“Selling, general and administrative expenses”

​

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $4 million and $3 million, respectively, for selling, general and administrative expenses for services provided to us by DISH Network.  These amounts are recorded in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The agreements pertaining to these expenses are discussed below.

​

Real Estate Lease Agreements.  We lease office space owned or leased by DISH Network from a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network.  The term of the remaining lease is set forth below:

​

      ●    Cheyenne Lease Agreement.  Our lease for certain space at 530 EchoStar Drive in Cheyenne, Wyoming from a wholly-owned

            subsidiary of DISH Network is for a period ending on December 31, 2031.

Item 2.MANAGEMENT’S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

​

You should read the following management’s narrative analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  This management’s narrative analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results.  Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

​

Overview

​

Segments

​

We currently operate one business segment, Pay-TV.

​

Our Pay-TV business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value.  We offer pay-TV services under the DISH® brand and the SLING® brand (collectively “Pay-TV” services).  We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with a better “price-to-value” relationship and experience than those available from other subscription television service providers.  The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, FCC licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) and Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations (“DISH TV”).  We also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/ downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers.  The SLING branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, multichannel, live-linear and on-demand streaming over-the-top (“OTT”) Internet-based domestic, international, Latino and Freestream video programming services (“SLING TV”).  We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative.

​

Recent Developments

​

Asset Transfer 

​

Concurrently with the issuance of the 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and the 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and using the proceeds thereof, we made the Intercompany Loan to DISH Network to be used by DISH Network to finance the purchase of certain wireless spectrum licenses and for general corporate purposes, including the buildout of wireless infrastructure.  The aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Loan was initially $5.250 billion, and on February 11, 2022, we advanced an additional $1.5 billion to DISH Network.  As of December 31, 2023, the receivable including capitalized paid in kind interest was $7.496 billion.  

​

​

Table of Contents

On January 10, 2024, we, in our capacity as “Lender” under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement related to the Intercompany Loan between DISH Network and us, have consummated the assignment pursuant to such terms, without any modification or amendment thereto, of our receivable in respect to the 2026 Tranche of $4.7 billion to DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.  DBS Intercompany Receivable L.L.C. has subsequently assigned its rights as lender thereunder to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable Company L.L.C., our ultimate parent, EchoStar’s direct wholly-owned subsidiary, such that amounts owed in respect of the 2026 Tranche will now be paid by DISH Network to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable L.L.C.  As of March 31, 2024, our total Intercompany Loan amount outstanding plus interest paid in kind was $2.799 billion, not including accrued interest receivable of $58 million, of which $28 million must be paid to us in cash.

​

Prior to January 10, 2024, we designated a newly formed subsidiary of DISH Network L.L.C. (the “DBS Subscriber Subsidiary”) as an unrestricted subsidiary.  DBS Subscriber Subsidiary holds approximately 3.0 million DISH TV subscribers immediately following the unrestricting of the entity.

​

EchoStar Merger with DISH Network

​

On December 31, 2023, EchoStar, our ultimate parent, completed the acquisition of DISH Network, our parent, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 2, 2023 (the “Amended Merger Agreement”), by and among EchoStar, EAV Corp., a Nevada corporation and EchoStar’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and DISH Network, pursuant to which EchoStar acquired DISH Network by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and into DISH Network (the “Merger”), with DISH Network surviving the Merger as EchoStar’s wholly-owned subsidiary.  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in EchoStar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

​

With the Merger complete, EchoStar is currently focused on the process of integrating its and DISH Network’s business in a manner that facilitates synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities and achieves other anticipated benefits (the “Integration”).

​

Future Capital Requirements

​

We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures, other investments, and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital.  We do not currently have the necessary cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities and/or projected future cash flows to fund the November 2024 debt maturity.  To address our capital needs, we are in active discussions with funding sources to raise additional capital. 

​

Our capital expenditures vary depending on, among other things, the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty.  Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate.  In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. 

​

Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at favorable terms.  These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position.

​

​

Table of Contents

We have made cash distributions and the Intercompany Loan to partially finance the development of DISH Network’s 5G Network Deployment, including, but not limited to, the purchase of wireless spectrum licenses and the retail wireless business to date, and we may make additional funds available to DISH Network or EchoStar in the form of cash distributions or loans to finance, in whole or in part, DISH Network or EchoStar’s future efforts.  These factors, including, but not limited to, debt maturities, continuing investment in our business, financing acquisitions and other strategic transactions, will require us to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

​

Economic Environment 

​

During 2023 and the first three months of 2024, we experienced inflationary pressures in our commodity and labor costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the United States, which has significantly impacted our overall operating results.

​

Pay-TV

​

We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand.  As of March 31, 2024, we had 8.178 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 6.258 million DISH TV subscribers and 1.920 million SLING TV subscribers. We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with better service, technology and value than those available from other subscription television service providers.  We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription.  Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national cable networks.  We also offer programming packages that include local broadcast networks, specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming.  We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative.  Our SLING TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including, among others, streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones.  We offer SLING domestic, SLING International, SLING Latino and SLING Freestream video programming services.

​

Trends

​

Competition

​

Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured.  We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services.  We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers.  In recent years, industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings.  These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue.  We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper® receivers, and by providing retention credits.  Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.

​

Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including, but not limited to, bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers.  Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services.  

​

​

Table of Contents

Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies that are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings and direct to consumer exclusive and non-exclusive content.  We also face competition from providers of video content, many of which are providers of programming content to us, that distribute content over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content.  These product offerings include, but are not limited to, Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Prime Video, YouTube TV, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, STARZ, Peacock, Fubo, Philo and Tubi and certain bundles of these offerings.

​

Significant changes in consumer behavior regarding the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.  In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband or Internet-connected device they choose.  Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services (“cord cutting”), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (“cord shaving”) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us.

​

Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described under the caption “Item 1A.  Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in our public filings.  These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all.  

​

Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above.  There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate.  As our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

​

Programming

​

Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.  Programming costs represent a large percentage of our “Cost of services” and the largest component of our total expense.  We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation.  In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers.  Our ability to provide services under these agreements and negotiate acceptable terms depends on, among other things, the number of subscribers we have, our actual, perceived or anticipated financial condition and our negotiating power against each programmer, which can vary depending on the size and scale of such programmer.  Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers.

​

Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our services or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our services.  Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us.

​

Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts.  In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers.  There can be no assurance that the removal of any channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.

​

We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future.  As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. 

​

Other Developments

​

Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Patents

​

Through our subsidiaries, we hold dozens of issued United States and foreign patents that relate to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming.  On September 9, 2022, the chief administrative law judge at the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) issued an Initial Determination holding that the video streaming in certain Peloton, NordicTrack and Mirror exercise equipment infringes four of those patents, and recommended that the ITC prevent the importation of the infringing products.  On March 8, 2023, the ITC issued its Final Determination, which affirmed the Initial Determination for three of the four patents in all material aspects, and issued the recommended exclusion and cease and desist orders, which will become effective after a Presidential review period. On February 9, 2023, we entered into a confidential license agreement covering Mirror exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. On May 1, 2023, we entered into a $75 million license agreement covering Peloton exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded the $75 million license agreement in “Equipment sales and other revenue” on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  On March 6, 2024, we entered into a license agreement covering NordicTrack exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products and received the initial payment.

​

Operational Liquidity 

​

We make general investments in property such as, among others, satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our Pay-TV business.  Moreover, since we are a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers.  While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary.  Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment.  Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurance that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment.

​

There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time.  The first factor is our churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers.  To the extent we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced.  The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our service margins.  To the extent our “Cost of services” grow faster than our “Service revenue,” the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced.  Our Pay-TV service margins have been reduced by, among other things, higher programming costs.  The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers.  The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers.  Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period.

Table of Contents

​

Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by, among other things, the rate at which we make general investments, incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities.  In addition, declines in our Pay-TV subscriber base and any decrease in subscriber-related margins negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurance that our subscriber declines will not continue.

​

Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity

​

The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty.  While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

​

Debt Issuances and Maturity

​

Our 5 7/8% Senior Notes due 2024 with remaining balance of approximately $1.983 billion matures on November 15, 2024. We do not currently have the necessary cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities and/or projected future cash flows to fund the November 2024 debt maturity.  To address our capital needs, we are in active discussions with funding sources to raise additional capital.

​

Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt

​

We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt.  In particular, the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes and senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on our ability to:  (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets.  Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes, senior secured notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable.  The senior notes and senior secured notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur.  As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt.

We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count.  We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts.  For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by $34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count.

​

SLING TV subscribers.  We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our SLING TV subscriber count.  SLING TV subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects.  SLING TV customers receiving SLING TV Freestream service, or service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our SLING TV subscriber count.  For customers who subscribe to multiple SLING TV packages, each customer is only counted as one SLING TV subscriber.

​

Pay-TV subscribers.  Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and SLING TV subscribers discussed above.  For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our SLING TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber.

​

Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (“Pay-TV ARPU”).  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Pay-TV “Service revenue,” for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period.  The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period.  The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two.  SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as SLING TV subscribers increase as a percentage of total Pay-TV subscribers, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.

DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate (“DISH TV churn rate”).  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  We calculate our “DISH TV churn rate” for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period.  The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period.  The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two.

​

DISH TV SAC.  Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry.  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the “average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation,” or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  Our DISH TV SAC is calculated using all costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized equipment, advertising, installation, commissions and direct sales, etc.), which are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses,” plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs and the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers, divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.  We include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.

Pay-TV Subscribers

​

DISH TV subscribers. We lost approximately 213,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 318,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023.  This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate, partially offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.

​

SLING TV subscribers.  We lost approximately 135,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 234,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023.  The decrease in net SLING TV subscriber losses was primarily related to lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, partially offset by lower SLING TV subscriber activations.  We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis.

​

DISH TV subscribers, gross.  During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we activated approximately 79,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 113,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 30.1%.  This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior, and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers.  Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers.  

​

DISH TV churn rate.  Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 1.53% compared to 1.98% for the same period in 2023.  Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers.  Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers.  Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud, and the level of our retention efforts. In addition, our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was briefly elevated due to the cyber-security incident.

​

Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future.  As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. 

​

We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service.  Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate.  Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue.

Service revenue.  “Service revenue” totaled $2.687 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $239 million or 8.2% compared to the same period in 2023.  The decrease in “Service revenue” compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below.

​

Pay-TV ARPU.  Pay-TV ARPU was $107.38 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 versus $102.71 during the same period in 2023.  The $4.67 or 4.5% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue.  The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023.

​

Cost of services.  “Cost of services” totaled $1.700 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $157 million or 8.4% compared to the same period in 2023.  The decrease in “Cost of services” was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and lower variable and retention costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber.  Programming costs per subscriber increased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels.  Variable and retention costs per subscriber during the three months ended March 31, 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million in cyber-security-related expenses to remediate the incident and provide additional customer support.  “Cost of services” represented 63.3% and 63.5% of “Service revenue” during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

​

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content.  Our “Cost of services” have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.  In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base.

​

Selling, general and administrative expenses. “Selling, general and administrative expenses” totaled $285 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a $50 million or 15.0% decrease compared to the same period in 2023.  This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs.

​

Depreciation and amortization.  “Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $71 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a $13 million or 15.8% decrease compared to the same period in 2023.  This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers.

​

DISH TV SAC.  DISH TV SAC was $1,054 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $1,055 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of $1 or 0.1%.  This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher installation costs due to an increase in labor and other installation costs and higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers.

​

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled $7 million and $15 million, respectively.  This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.

​

To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial.  To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.

Our “DISH TV SAC” may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.

​

Interest income.  “Interest income” totaled $59 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $61 million compared to the same period in 2023.  This decrease was primarily related to the reduction in interest income associated with our Intercompany Loan to DISH Network.  On January 10, 2024, $4.7 billion of this receivable was transferred to EchoStar, our ultimate parent.

​

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.  “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” totaled $185 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $14 million compared to the same period in 2023.  This decrease was primarily related to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the redemption of our 5% Senior Notes due 2023 on March 15, 2023.

Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Reconciliation

​

It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.  We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance.  The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.

​

EBITDA

​

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it is a helpful measure for those evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.  Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

OIBDA

​

OIBDA, which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance.  We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability of our business on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.  OIBDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income (loss).

GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION

​

Our registered senior notes, consisting of our 5 7/8% Senior Notes due 2024, 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026, 7 3/8% Senior Notes due 2028, and 5 1/8% Senior Notes due 2029, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).

​

Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are designated as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and do not guarantee any of our registered senior notes.  

​

We and our subsidiaries participate with our parent company, DISH Network, in a centralized system for the management of our cash and marketable investment securities.  Please see Note 3 for further information.

​

The guarantee of a Guarantor will be deemed automatically discharged and released in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture:  (i) in connection with any direct or indirect sale, conveyance or other disposition of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation), if such sale or disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture; (ii) if such Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the indenture; (iii) if we designate any such Guarantor as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” in compliance with the terms of the indenture; or (iv) with respect to a Guarantor which constitutes a Non-Core Asset (as such term is defined in the applicable indenture), upon the sale or other disposition of certain equity interests of such Guarantor, if such sale or disposition is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture.  There are no restrictions on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of funds from the Guarantors, except those imposed by applicable law.

​

The rights of holders of the registered senior notes against the Guarantors may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law.  Under certain circumstances (including a finding that a Guarantor was insolvent at the time its guarantee of the registered senior notes was issued), a court could hold that the obligations of a Guarantor under a guarantee may be voided or are subordinate to other obligations of the Guarantor.  Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under U.S. federal or state law.
