CIM OPPORTUNITY ZONE FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 2024 (Unaudited)



1. ORGANIZATION

CIM Opportunity Zone Fund, L.P., (the “Fund”), a Delaware limited partnership, was formed on November 1, 2018 and commenced operations on January 21, 2019 (the “Initial Closing”). The Fund is governed by the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated as of March 18, 2024 (as amended and restated, the “Partnership Agreement”). The Fund is organized as an open-ended vehicle for the purpose of investing in infrastructure and real estate, through entities that acquire, own, develop or re-develop and operate infrastructure and real estate assets, including assets in low-income communities in the United States that have been designated as “Opportunity Zones” pursuant to Section 1400Z-1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and which meet the criteria described in the Partnership Agreement. The Fund’s objective is generating returns from capital appreciation and operating income once development of these assets is complete. The Fund’s assets under development had plans in place or were operating at the time of the Fund’s acquisition that are strategic to each asset achieving current income and appreciation of value. The Fund engages third parties or affiliates of the Manager (also referred to as the “development manager”) to provide development management services and in consideration pays development management fees.

At least 90% of the Fund’s assets will consist of “qualified opportunity zone property”, which enables the Fund to be classified as a “qualified opportunity fund” within the meaning of Section 1400Z-2 of the Code (a “QOF”). The Fund qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a QOF beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2020.

The general partner of the Fund is CIM Opportunity Zone Fund GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “General Partner”), and an affiliate of CIM Group, LLC (together with its controlled affiliates, “CIM”). One or more affiliates of CIM acts as the manager of the Fund (the “Manager”). The Fund also has limited partners (the “Limited “Partners”, affiliated limited partners (the “Affiliated Limited Partners”) and, together with the General Partner, the “Partners”)).

The Fund shall continue until it is dissolved and subsequently terminated upon (a) a determination made by the General Partner at any time in its discretion, (b) the bankruptcy, termination, dissolution or withdrawal of the General Partner, (c) the consent of a majority of the Limited Partners by number and the consent of 75% of Limited Partners by units to dissolve the Fund or (d) the entry of a decree of dissolution with respect to the Fund.

Subject to legal, tax, regulatory and other similar considerations, all calls for capital from the Limited Partners shall be made pursuant to a notice, and unless otherwise determined in the General Partner’s discretion, capital contributions will be drawn first from all commitments made during the same closing date pro rata, and 100% of such commitments will be funded prior to calling capital from partners admitted during subsequent closings.

As of March 31, 2024, total capital commitments and capital contributions from the partners are summarized as follows (in thousands):



               Capital Commitments                                Capital Contributions                                  Unfunded Commitments

$                                      1,971,569    $                                      1,971,569    $                                                 — 

2. CHANGE IN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING (RESTATEMENT)

As previously disclosed in the Fund’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, following the filing of the Fund’s Form 10, in May 2023 the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Staff”) began a review of the Fund’s Form 10. Part of this review focused on the appropriateness of the Fund’s application of Accounting Standards Codification 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies (“ASC 946”). Ultimately, the Staff advised the Fund that it did not agree with the Fund’s application of ASC 946 in its financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Following the review process and after further consideration, the Fund concluded that its historical interim financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 should be restated.

Description of Restatement Adjustments

The Fund has historically presented its annual audited and interim unaudited financial statements using investment company accounting methods based on its interpretation of the criteria prescribed under ASC 946. These accounting and financial reporting methods generally resulted in the presentation of the assets and liabilities of the Fund on a fair value

basis, rather than at historical cost. The restated financial statements will generally reflect the assets and liabilities of the Fund at historical cost, net of depreciation and amortization, rather than at fair value. Additionally, the restated financial statements include the consolidated accounts and results of operations for the entities in which the Fund has determined that it has controlling financial interest, and redeemable limited partners’ capital is classified as non-permanent equity. The Fund's financial statements previously included a Schedule of Investments, which is not a required schedule for a historical cost-basis entity.

Restatement Reconciliation Tables

In light of the foregoing, in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, the Fund has restated the previously issued consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to reflect the effects of the restatement adjustments, and to make certain corresponding disclosures. The following tables present a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of changes in partners’ capital, and consolidated statements of cash flows as previously reported for such prior periods to the restated amounts (in thousands).

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation — The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair statement in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of CIM Opportunity Zone Fund, L.P. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Fund and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The portions of equity in consolidated subsidiaries that are wholly-owned and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Fund are presented as non-controlling interests. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In determining whether the Fund has controlling interests in an entity and is required to consolidate the accounts in that entity, the Fund analyzes its investments in accordance with standards set forth in GAAP to determine whether the entities are variable interest entities (“VIEs”), and if so, whether the Fund is the primary beneficiary. The Fund’s judgment with respect to its level of influence or control over an entity and whether the Fund is the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves consideration of various factors, including the form of the Fund’s ownership interest, the Fund’s voting interest, the size of the Fund’s investment (including loans), and the Fund’s ability to participate in major policy-making decisions. The Fund’s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of its investments on the Fund’s consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate and Infrastructure — Investments in real estate and infrastructure are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Fund considers the period of future benefit of each respective asset to determine the appropriate useful life. Depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:



Buildings and improvements                                             15 - 40 years

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment                                     3 - 5 years

Tenant improvements                                                    Lesser of useful life or lease term

Intangible lease assets and liabilities                                Lease term

Solar batteries                                                        13 years

Solar assets                                                           35 years

Capitalized Project Costs

The Fund capitalizes project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest expense, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, or construction of a project, while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Recoverability of Investments in Real Estate and Infrastructure — The Fund continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. Investments in real estate and infrastructure are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, the recoverability of assets to be held and used requires significant judgment and estimates and is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and their eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The process for evaluating real estate impairment requires management to make significant assumptions related to certain inputs, including rental rates, lease-up period, occupancy, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, growth rates, market discount rates and terminal capitalization rates. These inputs require a subjective evaluation based on the specific property and market. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, if any, or both. Any asset held for sale is reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. When an asset is identified by the Fund as held for sale, the Fund will cease recording depreciation and amortization of the asset. The Fund did not recognize any impairment of long-lived assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The assumptions and uncertainties utilized in the evaluation of the impairment of real estate assets are discussed in detail in Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements. See also Note 5 — Investments in Real Estate for further discussion regarding real estate investment activity.

March 31, 2024 (Unaudited)

Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate and Infrastructure Investments — The Fund determines whether a purchase qualifies as an asset acquisition or meets the definition of an acquisition of a business. Acquisition of real estate and infrastructure assets for development are generally recognized at cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions. The Fund applies the acquisition method to all acquired real estate and infrastructure investments. The purchase consideration of the real estate, which includes the transaction costs incurred in connection with such acquisitions, is recorded on a relative fair value basis to the acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, land improvements, building and improvements, tenant improvements, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of acquired above-market and below-market leases, above and below-market solar agreements, in-place leases and ground leases, if any, based in each case on their relative fair values. Assumed debt is recorded at fair value based upon the present value of the expected future payments and current interest rates.

In allocating the purchase consideration of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market, below-market, and in-place lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, and for below-market agreements, over a period equal to the initial term plus any below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. Acquired above-market and below-market leases are amortized and recorded to rental and other property income over the initial terms of the respective leases.

The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases and tenant relationships, is measured by the estimated cost of operations during a theoretical lease-up period to replace in-place leases, including lost revenues and any unreimbursed operating expenses, plus an estimate of deferred leasing commissions for in-place leases. The value of in-place leases is amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written-off.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, at Fair Value — The Fund accounts for its investments in unconsolidated entities under the equity method, as the Fund has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investments. The Fund’s investments in unconsolidated entities are carried under the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825, Financial Instruments on the Fund’s consolidated balance sheets, with any changes in the fair value of such investments recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

The fair values of investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. Investments without a public market are valued based on applicable valuation techniques. Such valuation techniques include discounted cash flow analysis, applying market capitalization rates or earnings multiples to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, multiple valuation techniques are taken into consideration when measuring the fair value of an investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation may be appropriate, such as during the development phase of the project, where the “Cost Method” may be most appropriate for construction in progress, with the “Comparative Sales Approach” applied to the value of the underlying land. Upon completion, the investment would typically be valued utilizing the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) and Comparative Sales approaches. Weighting of the appraisal methods represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date.

Notes Payable, at Fair Value — The Fund has elected the fair value option for its notes payable, and records the changes in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for further details on the assumptions used.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses — Accounts payable and accrued expenses include accrued capital expenditures of $58.1 million and $61.9 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Noncontrolling Interests — Noncontrolling interests represent the interests in various properties owned by third parties.

Leases — The Fund has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components for all classes of underlying assets (primarily real estate assets) and

will account for the combined components as rental and other property income. Non-lease components included in rental and other property income include certain tenant reimbursements for maintenance services (including common-area maintenance services or “CAM”), real estate taxes, insurance and utilities paid for by the lessor but consumed by the lessee. As a lessor, the Fund has further determined that this policy will be effective only on a lease that has been classified as an operating lease and the revenue recognition pattern and timing is the same for both types of components. 

Significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in not only determining if a contract contains a lease, but also the lease classification, terms, payments, and, if needed, discount rates. Judgments include the nature of any options, including if they will be exercised, evaluation of implicit discount rates and the assessment and consideration of “fixed” payments for straight-line rent revenue calculations.

Lease costs represent the initial direct costs incurred in the origination, negotiation and processing of a lease agreement. Such costs include outside broker commissions and other independent third-party costs and are amortized over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis. Costs related to salaries and benefits, supervision, administration, unsuccessful origination efforts and other activities not directly related to completed lease agreements are expensed as incurred. Upon successful lease execution, leasing commissions are capitalized.

Redeemable Partners’ Capital — Limited Partners may request a partial or total redemption of their units upon the expiration of the applicable lock-up period, which is four years from the date of the initial capital contribution made by such limited partner in respect of such capital commitment. As such, the redeemable limited partnership units are presented at the redemption amount in temporary equity under redeemable partners’capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The redemption amount is initially recorded as the contribution amount and is subsequently remeasured at the net asset value as determined in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Net asset value is calculated as U.S. GAAP partners’ equity adjusted for the redemption value of our limited partnership units. Increases or decreases in the value of limited partnership units will be reflected in retained earnings (deficit). The difference between the carrying amount and the redemption amount is reflected in change in fair value of redeemable limited partners’ capital in the consolidated statements of changes in partners’ capital.

Revenue Recognition and Lease Receivables — Rental and other property income is primarily derived from fixed contractual payments from operating leases, and therefore, is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which typically begins the date the tenant takes control of the space. When the Fund acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purpose of this calculation. Variable rental and other property income consists primarily of tenant reimbursements for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses which are included in rental and other property income in the period when such costs are incurred, with offsetting expenses in real estate taxes and property operating expenses, respectively, within the consolidated statements of operations. The Fund defers the recognition of variable rental and other property income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved.

The Fund continually reviews whether collection of lease-related receivables, including any straight-line rent, and current and future operating expense reimbursements from tenants is probable. The determination of whether collectability is probable takes into consideration the tenant’s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. Upon the determination that the collectability of a receivable is not probable, the Fund will record a reduction to rental and other property income for amounts previously recorded and a decrease in the outstanding receivable. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be not probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability becomes probable. Management’s estimate of the collectability of lease-related receivables is based on the best information available at the time of estimate. The Fund does not use a general reserve approach and lease-related receivables are adjusted and taken against rental and other property income only when collectability becomes not probable.

Solar revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Solar revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Solar revenue from contracts with customers is derived from the generation and sale of renewable electric energy and the environmental attributes and capacity attributes generated by or associated with the facility. For these types of sales, the Fund recognizes revenue at the point in time the electric energy, environmental attributes and capacity attributes are delivered or made available, consistent with the amounts billed to or paid from customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed.

Investment tax credits — Certain of the Fund’s investments generate investment tax credits (“ITC”), which it generally expects to monetize through sale and transfer to third parties for cash consideration. The Fund has elected to account for these types of credits under a government grant model, by analogy to IAS 20. At the time the ITC is generated, the Fund records the ITC at its estimated market value as an other asset and a reduction to the cost of solar facilities, as presented in the consolidated balance sheets. The credit will be recognized over the useful life of the solar facilities, which have a weighted average useful life of 26.7 years, as a reduction to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon sale of the ITC, the Fund will recognize the difference between the sales proceeds and the recorded value of the other asset in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. To date, as of March 31, 2024, the Fund’s investments have generated approximately $334.8 million of investment tax credits that were recorded at their estimated market value of $308.1 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, amortization of the ITC credit was $3.7 million and is reflected as a reduction to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. The Fund sold the ITC during the year ended December 31, 2023, and during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Fund recognized an additional $2.9 million gain included in other income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents — Cash represents cash deposits held at high-quality financial institutions. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments of sufficient credit quality that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents are held to meet short-term liquidity requirements, rather than for investment purposes.

Restricted Cash — Restricted cash for real estate taxes, insurance, and other miscellaneous reserves, is recorded on the consolidated financial statements in accordance with agreements that require segregation of funds related to the operations of the respective real estate investment or related mortgage payable agreements.

Concentration of Credit Risk — Cash held at major financial institutions is subject to credit risk to the extent those balances exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limitations, of up to $250,000 per financial institution.

Contributions Receivable — Contributions receivable represents contributions with an effective date before the period presented but received from investors subsequent to period end.

Property Acquisition Deposits — The Fund may advance certain amounts to acquirees as refundable deposits for impending acquisitions. Upon successful execution of the acquisition, amounts advanced will be reclassified to investments in real estate.

Risk Management — In the normal course of business, the Fund encounters economic risk such as market risk and concentration of investment risk. Market risk reflects changes in the valuation of investments in real estate and equity method investees held by the Fund. Concentration of investment risk represents the risk associated with investments that are concentrated in certain geographic regions and industries.

Income Taxes — The Fund intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Accordingly, the Fund does not record a provision for U.S. federal, state, or local income taxes because the partners report their share of the Fund’s income or loss on their income tax returns. If the Fund fails to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, and if the Fund is not entitled to relief under the Code for an inadvertent termination of its partnership status, the Fund will be subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates.

The Fund currently qualifies as a QOF commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2020 under Section 1400Z-2 of the Code. If, in future periods, the Fund does not satisfy the requirements to be a QOF, it may be subject to penalty taxes as provided under the Code (unless it is eligible for a reasonable-cause exception). 

ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Fund’s tax returns to determine whether tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current period.

Reportable Segments — The Fund’s real estate investments consist of infrastructure and real estate assets located within qualified opportunity zones. The Fund’s management evaluates operating performance on an overall portfolio level; therefore the Fund’s real estate investments are one reportable segment.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements — In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 enhances the disclosures required for reportable segments on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In determining fair value, the Fund uses various valuation approaches. The definition of estimated fair value is applied on a consistent basis with that required by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 establishes a fair value measurement framework, provides a single definition of fair value, and requires expanded disclosure summarizing fair value measurements. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

The FASB issued guidance that establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. The guidance clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value in a market-based measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the FASB established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1 — Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2 — Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or through corroboration with observable market data; and

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs, for which there is little or no market data for the assets or liabilities, such as internally developed valuation models.

In instances where the determination of a fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

The following describes the methods the Fund uses to estimate the fair value of the Fund’s financial assets and liabilities:

Investments in unconsolidated entities, at fair value — Investments in unconsolidated entities are generally valued using Level 3 inputs. The Fund’s valuations are prepared by third-party valuation firms in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”). The fair values of investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell the Fund’s interests in the unconsolidated entity in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. Investments without a public market are valued based on assumptions made and valuation techniques. Such valuation techniques include discounted cash flow analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates or earnings multiples applied to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, multiple valuation techniques are taken into consideration when measuring the fair value of an investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation may be appropriate, such as during the development phase of the project, where the “Cost Method” may be most appropriate for construction in progress, with the “Comparative Sales Approach” applied to the value of the underlying land. Upon completion, the investment would typically be valued utilizing the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) and Comparative Sales approaches. Weighting of the

appraisal methods represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date.

Notes payable — The fair value of notes payable is determined by a third-party appraiser who discounts the difference between contract and market debt service cash flows using a market equity yield. The third-party appraiser also considers multiple valuation techniques (e.g., par, prepayment penalty) and applies a reconciliation among relevant methods. The fair value analysis is updated quarterly and reviewed by senior management. The market rate is determined by giving consideration to one or more of the following criteria, as appropriate: (i) interest rates for loan of comparable quality and maturity and (ii) the value of the underlying collateral. The Fund’s notes payable are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Other financial instruments — The Fund considers the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization as well as their highly-liquid nature. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments.

Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Fund could realize, or be liable for, upon disposition of the financial assets and liabilities. The Fund evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. The Fund does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following tables show the fair value of the Fund’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are as follows (in thousands):

Under the sales comparison technique, the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Fund’s investments is value per square foot. Increases or decreases in the value per square foot may result in a lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively.

Under the discounted cash flow technique, the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Fund’s investments is the discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, and revenue growth rate, as applicable. Increases or decreases in the rates in isolation may result in a higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. An increase or decrease in the discount rate used to determine fair value would result in a decrease or increase to the fair value, respectively. An increase or decrease in the terminal capitalization rate or revenue growth rate would result in an increase or decrease to the fair value, respectively.

9. PARTNERS’ CAPITAL AND REDEEMABLE PARTNERS’ CAPITAL

Contributions

Admission, and timing thereof, of new partners into the Fund is at the general discretion of the General Partner. Each Limited Partner may be required on or soon after such Limited Partner’s admission to the Fund, to make a capital contribution to the Fund with respect to its capital commitment in an amount specified in a notice delivered by the General Partner at least three business days prior to the due date of such capital contribution. Thereafter, each Limited Partner shall generally make capital contributions at the discretion of the General Partner in an amount specified in a notice delivered by the General Partner at least ten business days prior to such date and only up to the amount of such Limited Partner’s undrawn commitment.

In connection with each capital contribution, a Limited Partner shall be issued Units based on the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) as of such quarter-end. If a Limited Partner makes a capital contribution on a date other than on or around the last day of a quarter, such capital contribution shall generate a fixed return equivalent to an effective rate of 3.0% per annum from the date of such capital contribution until the next date on which the NAV is determined (generally the last calendar day of the quarter in which such capital contribution was made) and such partner will not participate in any other profit or loss, other than management fees, with respect to such capital contributions. The intra-quarter contributions generated fixed returns of $119,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $343,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which are included in the statements of changes in partners’ capital and redeemable partners’ capital as fixed return increase and fixed return decrease. As of March 31, 2024, the Fund had $211,000 of contributions receivable and $200,000 of advance capital contributions in the consolidated balance sheets.

Distributions

The Fund will make distributions pro-rata to the Limited Partners at such time and in such amounts as determined by the General Partner in its discretion. As of March 31, 2024, the Fund had $32.6 million of distributions payable in the consolidated balance sheets related to incentive allocation to the SLP.

Redeemable Partners’ Capital

Limited Partners may request a partial or total redemption of their units upon the expiration of the applicable lock-up period, which is four years from the date of the initial capital contribution made by such limited partner in respect of such capital commitment, by providing written notice to the General Partner no later than the last calendar day of the quarter immediately preceding such redemption date, subject to certain restrictions as specified in the Partnership Agreement. Redemptions are only made to the extent that the Fund has sufficient cash available to honor redemption requests, as determined in the discretion of the General Partner. In addition, the General Partner or its affiliates may make a partial or total redemption of their units attributable to incentive allocation without notice to the Limited Partners at any time in their discretion.

10. MANAGEMENT FEES, INCENTIVE ALLOCATION AND OTHER RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Management fees

The Manager provides investment management services to the Fund. For these services, the Fund pays the Manager management fees in advance on a quarterly basis (the “Management Fees”). The Management Fees are calculated based on each Limited Partner’s Management Fee percentage, which ranged from 1.25% to 2.0% as of March 31, 2024, multiplied by their proportionate share of NAV as of the beginning of the quarter.

Incentive allocation

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner or an affiliate thereof or other designee of the General Partner, will be allocated net profits (the “Incentive Allocation”) from the Limited Partners at the end of an incentive allocation period, subject to certain performance hurdles being met. The General Partner receives an Incentive Allocation of 20% annually, which is the portion of profits or gains that the General Partner is entitled to above a minimum return threshold. The high watermark is a mechanism that ensures the General Partner only receives an Incentive Allocation if the Fund’s value surpasses the highest previous value. This means that if the Fund’s value decreases below the high watermark, the General Partner will not receive any Incentive Allocation until the value exceeds the previous high point. The hurdle rate, which is set at 6%, is a minimum rate of return that the Fund needs to achieve before the General Partner becomes eligible for the Incentive Allocation. The General Partner is entitled to an 80% catch-up provision once the hurdle rate is met, which means that once the hurdle rate is surpassed, the General Partner will receive 80% of the profits or gains until they have caught up to their entitled share.

The General Partner has designated CIM Opportunity Zone Fund SLP, LLC (the “SLP”), an affiliated Limited Partner, to receive the Incentive Allocation. The General Partner may, in its discretion, waive, reduce or defer Incentive Allocation of all or a portion of the Incentive Allocation attributable to any Units of any Limited Partner. Since inception through March 31, 2024, the Fund has incurred incentive fees and allocation totaling $59.4 million.

Servicing Fees

The General Partner or its affiliates may also provide to the Fund and/or its investments part or all of other services (“Other Services”) that would otherwise be provided by a third party, including servicing fees and reimbursement of allocable costs and expenses incurred in connection with or relating to the performance of any Other Services. Pursuant to such provided services, the General Partner or its affiliates may receive from the Fund and/or its Portfolio Assets, (i) property management fees, (ii) development management fees, (iii) leasing brokerage fees, (iv) fees associated with arranging financings for Portfolio Assets, (v) multifamily residential sales fees, (vi) fees relating to servicing and administering the Portfolio Assets, including special servicing, (vii) fees in connection with or following a foreclosure on the Portfolio Asset and (viii) other related fees in connection with a Portfolio Asset (collectively, “Servicing Fees”). Such Servicing Fees will be either (x) at rates which do not exceed the limits set forth immediately below, (y) at rates that are no less favorable to the Partnership and/or such Portfolio Asset than the arm’s-length rates on which the Fund and/or such Portfolio Asset could obtain comparable services from an unaffiliated service provider taking into account the nature of the relevant asset type and the special services required or (z) at rates that receive the consent of a Review Agent or the Limited Partners:

The Fund may coinvest with other entities that are related parties of CIM. As of March 31, 2024, the Fund held investments with a total fair value of $657.8 million that was coinvested with funds that are related parties of CIM.

The Fund has an investment in a real estate property that is subject to a ground lease with a remaining term of 95 years, for which a lease liability and right of use (“ROU”) asset of $33.1 million and $33.3 million was recorded as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The ROU asset and lease liability were initially measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments using a discount rate of 3.6%. This reflects the Fund’s incremental borrowing rate, which was calculated based on the interest rate the Fund would incur to borrow on a fully collateralized basis over a term similar to the lease.

The Fund recognized $511,000 of ground lease expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, of which $200,000 and was paid in cash during the period it was recognized. As of March 31, 2024, the Fund’s scheduled future minimum rental payments related to its operating ground lease is approximately $600,000 for the remainder of 2024, $800,000 annually for 2025 through 2029, and $196.2 million thereafter through the maturity date of the lease in December 2118.

Overview

The Fund was formed on November 1, 2018 and commenced operations on January 21, 2019, and is governed by the Partnership Agreement. The Fund is organized as an open-ended vehicle for the purpose of investing in infrastructure and real estate, through entities that acquire, own, develop or re-develop and operate infrastructure and real estate assets in Opportunity Zones, with the objective of generating returns from capital appreciation and operating income once development of these assets is complete. The Fund’s assets under development had plans in place or were developed at the time of the Fund’s acquisition that are strategic to each asset achieving current income and appreciation of value. The Fund engages third parties or affiliates of the Manager (also referred to as the “development manager”) to provide development management services, and in consideration the Fund pays development management fees. 

Portfolio Information

As of March 31, 2024, we had investments in 21 assets, including investments in unconsolidated entities, with an aggregate net book value of $1.8 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we acquired 99% ownership interests in two properties under development located in Los Angeles, California.

Solar revenue

The increase in solar income of $27.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the Fund’s solar assets being place into service during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Rental and other property income

The increase in rental and other property income of $4.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increased rental income at our office property located in Dallas, Texas.

Management fees to related party

Management fees to related party are calculated based on each Limited Partner’s Management Fee percentage multiplied by their proportionate share of NAV as of the beginning of the quarter. 

The increase in management fees of $1.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in NAV driven by additional capital raised. From March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024 the Fund accepted an additional $317.6 million in capital contributions. 

Expense reimbursement to related parties

The Manager receives reimbursement for performing certain services for the Fund and its subsidiaries. 

The increase in expense reimbursement to related parties of $306,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the increased assets at March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023. With an increase in total assets, the scale of operations and the complexity of managing the assets also increases.

Interest expense and other

Interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs.

The increase in interest expense of $755,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increased borrowings on our notes payable during the period, along with increased interest rates subsequent to March 31, 2023.

Table of Contents

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist of legal, third-party administrator expenses, audit and tax expenses, banking fees and corporate expenses.

The increase in general and administrative expenses of $2.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the increase in total assets at March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023, as further described above. With an increase in total assets, the scale of operations and the complexity of managing the assets also increases. This generally leads to higher administrative expenses, as more resources and personnel are required.

Depreciation and amortization

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $9.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to depreciation expense on the Fund’s solar assets after being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Real estate tax

Real estate tax during the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained relatively consistent compared to the same period in 2023.

Solar and property operating expense

The increase in solar and property operating expense of $7.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the increased expenses on the Fund’s solar assets after being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023, in addition to the acquisition of three properties subsequent to March 31, 2023.

Interest and other income

Interest and other income consists of amounts received on interest-bearing accounts. 

The increase in interest and other income of $834,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher balances in our interest-bearing accounts during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities

Gain on investments in unconsolidated entities reflect the changes in fair value of the Fund’s investments in unconsolidated entities.

The increase in gain on investments in unconsolidated entities of $4.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to an increase in the valuation of the portfolio assets held by the unconsolidated entities as a result of increased operational performance.

Change in fair value of notes payable

We have elected the fair value option for our notes payable. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

The decrease in the change in fair value of notes payable of $1.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the impact of increasing interest rates throughout the three months ended March 31, 2024, impacting the value of our notes payable.

Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests

The decrease in net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $358,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to the proportional allocation of net loss to the non-controlling interest holder during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

We expect to utilize proceeds from net cash provided by operations and capital contributions received to finance our future acquisitions of and additions to investments. The sources of our operating cash flow will primarily be provided by rental income received from current and future leased properties and solar income from infrastructure assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from our continuous private offering of our Units in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, cash flows from our operating assets, and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future.

Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in portfolio entities and other investments, pay our operating fees and expenses (including the Management Fee and Incentive Allocation), pay any distributions that we make to the holders of our units, periodic repurchases under the Redemption Program, and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness that we incur.

We expect to obtain the liquidity and capital resources that we need over the short and long-term from cash on hand, the proceeds of our private offerings and from any undistributed funds from operations. For additional detail regarding our private offering, see “Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Use of Proceeds from Registered Sales of Securities” in the Fund’s Annual Report 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We currently anticipate that our available capital resources, including the proceeds from our private offering and the proceeds from any financing arrangements we may enter into, when combined with cash flow generated from our operating assets, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.

Contractual Obligations

As of March 31, 2024, we had fixed and variable rate mortgage loans payable with an outstanding principal balance of $282.7 million and fair value of $280.7 million. The Fund’s mortgage notes payable are collateralized by the respective property on which the debt was placed. The mortgage notes payable are nonrecourse, and contain various restrictions and covenants with which the Fund was in compliance as of March 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.

We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our significant accounting policies are described in “Note 3 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Recoverability of Real Estate and Infrastructure Assets

As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, investments in real estate and infrastructure are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.

Our process for evaluating real estate impairment requires management to make significant assumptions related to certain inputs, including rental rates, lease-up period, occupancy, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, growth rates, market discount rates and terminal capitalization rates. These inputs require a subjective evaluation based on the specific property and market. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, if any, or both.

Acquisitions and Initial Consolidation of VIEs

We account for property acquisitions as asset acquisitions. We allocate the purchase price for asset acquisitions, which includes the capitalized transaction costs, and for the properties upon the initial consolidation of VIEs not determined to be a business, on a relative fair value basis to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective relative fair values. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an investment in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date consistent with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above- and below-market lease values, above- and below-market solar agreements, and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience, developed using valuation techniques consistent with the guidance in ASC 820. There are risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations. The value allocated to land, as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements, affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates including market rent, lease terms including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current

market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions. We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below-market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar types of debt financing with similar maturities.

Fair Value Measurements

Investments in unconsolidated entities, at Fair Value — We have elected the fair value option for our other real estate related investments for which such election is permitted, as provided for under ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”). Electing the fair value option allows us to record changes in fair value in our consolidated statement of operations. The valuation of the Fund’s investments in unconsolidated entities are prepared by third-party valuation firms in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”). The fair values of investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an investment in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date consistent with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Investments without a public market are valued based on applicable valuation techniques. Such valuation techniques include discounted cash flow analysis, applying market capitalization rates or earnings multiples to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, multiple valuation techniques are taken into consideration when measuring the fair value of an investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation may be appropriate, such as during the development phase of the project, where the “Cost Method” may be most appropriate for construction in progress, with the “Comparative Sales Approach” applied to the value of the underlying land. Upon completion, the investment would typically be valued utilizing the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) and comparative sales approaches. Weighting of the appraisal methods represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date.

The weighting of valuation methodologies occurs in the reconciliation phase of the appraisal process and represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date. In the reconciliation process, appraisers weight the various approaches based on the quantity and quality of the data that was available for the analysis, including the number of relevant comparable sales and other data points, as well as the degree to which the appraisers were able to verify them. Appraisers also consider the typical behavior and attributes of the most likely purchasers of the property, including whether they would most likely be local, regional or national in size, and whether they are expected to be investors, owner-users, or partial owner-users. It is up to the appraisers to determine which approaches to value are applicable and what weight to apply to each approach utilized. In arriving at an as-is value, appraisers reflect how market participants would value a property by viewing it as a typical buyer would. For income-producing properties, the income approach, and specifically the DCF analysis, receives primary consideration. Comparable sales are also analyzed as a secondary method, providing indications of reasonable value per square foot as well as cap rates. The “Cost Method” is relied upon less frequently, but will receive a heavier weighting in situations where the subject asset has been recently developed or is under construction. Ultimately, assuming that there is sufficient data in the market to support the appraisers’ analysis, all three approaches should broadly support the concluded value, even if the appraisers place primarily weight on one approach in order to mirror investor behavior.

Redeemable Partners’ Capital — Redeemable limited partnership units are initially recorded as the contribution amount under redeemable partners’ capital in the consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently remeasured at the net asset value as determined in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Net asset value is calculated as U.S. GAAP partners’ equity adjusted for the redemption value of our limited partnership units. The judgements involved in the valuation are the same as those described above in “investments in unconsolidated entities, at fair value”.

Notes payable — We have elected the fair value option for our notes payable pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments. The fair value of notes payable is determined by a third-party appraiser who discounts the difference between contract and market debt service cash flows using a market equity yield. The third-party appraiser also considers multiple valuation techniques (e.g., par, prepayment penalty) and applies a reconciliation among relevant methods. The fair value analysis is updated quarterly and reviewed by senior management. The market rate is determined by giving consideration to one or more of the following criteria, as appropriate: (i) interest rates for loan of comparable quality and maturity and (ii) the value of the underlying collateral. 

CIM maintains a Valuation Committee to oversee the valuation process. The committee is comprised of the Chief Valuation Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, a member of Senior Management and the Chief Compliance Officer of CIM. The Valuation Committee typically obtains a full appraisal on each asset at least annually, and limited scope updates at least quarterly, from a qualified third-party appraiser as part of the valuation process. CIM’s valuation policy described above is in place at the time of this filing, but is subject to change in the discretion of CIM.

Estimates

Many of our accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Any differences of opinion that arise as to assumptions and metrics utilized in the valuation are discussed and resolved through analysis and comparison to published benchmarks and reference to recent market transactions. These estimates are subject to change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. The recent accounting changes that may potentially impact our business, if any, are described under “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in “Note 3 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K, the Fund, as a smaller reporting company, is not required to provide the information required by this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

During the process of preparing the Fund’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the material weakness described in ‘Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting’ below. The material weakness resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 included in the Fund’s Form 10, as amended, and for fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 contained in the Fund’s Form 10-Qs. In response to these conditions, management has developed and begun implementing a remediation plan for the related controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023.

As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of March 31, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). 

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of March 31, 2024, were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Consistent with the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting remediation plan outlined below, management will monitor and test its Disclosure Controls and Procedures for a sufficient period of time to enable management to conclude on the effectiveness of the controls and procedures.

Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the process of preparing the Fund’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze significant internal and external circumstances and events to enable the identification and assessment of risks of material misstatements. Specifically, the Fund did not design and maintain effective controls to identify that certain business objectives involve substantive activities which are inconsistent with the definition of an investment company under the accounting standards. As a result, the Fund misinterpreted and misapplied investment company accounting standards in its financial statements. The Fund financial statements should have been presented under historical cost and consolidation accounting standards. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

33



Table of Contents

This material weakness resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 included in the Fund’s Form 10, as amended, and for fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and 2022 and September 30, 2023 and 2022 contained in the Fund’s Form 10-Qs. If not remediated, this material weakness could result in further misstatements of account balances or disclosures that could result in additional material misstatements of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

In response to the identified material weakness, management has developed and begun implementing a remediation plan to enhance its internal controls over financial reporting, which generally includes an enhanced risk assessment, additional employee training and implementation of additional control activities. Management will continue to monitor its internal controls over financial reporting until the controls have operated for a sufficient period of time to enable management to adequately test and conclude on the operating effectiveness of the controls.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In connection with the changes to the Fund’s financial statements as described above, the Fund has implemented incremental internal controls specific to historical cost-basis accounting, including, among other things, controls over purchase price allocations, impairments, depreciation and amortization, straight-line rent, and consolidations. Management implemented these controls as of December 31, 2023 and will continue to monitor and test these controls for a sufficient period of time to enable management to conclude on their operating effectiveness.

With the exception of the above items, no other change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
