SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS

 

Various statements in this Quarterly on Form 10-Q of AppTech Payments Corp. (we, our, AppTech or the Company) are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on information currently available to our management. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “contemplates,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “likely,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions or words, identify forward-looking statements. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Meaningful factors that could cause actual results to differ include:

 

     ·    delays and uncertainty associated with the boarding of clients onto our platform;

           

     ·    substantial investment and costs associated with new potential revenue streams and their corresponding contractual

           obligations;

           

     ·    a slowdown or reduction in our sales due to a reduction in end user demand, unanticipated competition, regulatory issues, or

           other unexpected

           circumstances;

           

     ·    uncertainty regarding adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, a recession, changes to fiscal and monetary

           policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, consumer confidence and spending, and high

           unemployment;

           

     ·    dependence on third-parties needed to facilitate our automated clearing house ("ACH") and merchant service capabilities;

           

     ·    delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approval for any future products in additional countries, and;

           

     ·    current and future laws and regulations.

 

All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We caution investors not to rely too heavily on the forward-looking statements we make or that are made on our behalf. We undertake no obligation and specifically decline any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Please see, however, any further disclosures we make on related subjects in any annual, quarterly or current reports that we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

 

We encourage you to read the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There can be no assurance that we will in fact achieve the actual results or developments we anticipate or, even if we do substantially realize them, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us. Therefore, we can give no assurances that we will achieve the outcomes stated in those forward-looking statements and estimates.

 

Unless the context otherwise requires, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words “AppTech” “we,” “us,” the “registrant” or the “Company” refer to AppTech Payments Corp.

APPTECH PAYMENTS CORP. 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(in thousands, except per share data)

 

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

AppTech Payments Corp. (“AppTech” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a Fintech Company headquartered in Carlsbad, California. AppTech utilizes innovative payment processing and digital banking technologies to complement its core merchant services capabilities. The Company’s patented and proprietary software will provide progressive and adaptable products that are available through a suite of synergistic offerings directly to merchants, banking institutions, and business enterprises.

AppTech stock trades under the symbol “APCX” and its warrants trade under the symbol “APCXW,” on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("NASDAQ").

  

In June 2023, the Company entered into licensing agreements with InstaCash and PayToMe.co. As part of the arrangement with these parties, the Company negotiated a 7.5% preferred share equity interest. As of the date of this filing, the shares have not been issued to AppTech. InstaCash's CEO also provides investor relation services to the company. The shares have not been issued as of the date of this filing. Additionally, PayToMe.co is a related party to AppTech. Senior members of the Company sit on PayToMe.co's board of directors and AppTech's Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is married to its founder and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).

 

In August 2023, the Company entered into a sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $18.0 million through “at-the-market” offerings (ATM), pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC.

  

On October 13, 2023, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Membership Interest Purchase Agreement”) with Alliance Partners, LLC, a Nevada based software development limited liability company (“Alliance Partners”, “FinZeo”), and Chris Leyva (the “Seller” and collectively the “Parties”) pursuant to which the Company agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, to purchase 100% of the Seller’s interest in, to and under the membership interests of Alliance Partners (the “Transaction”). As consideration for the purchase of the membership interests of Alliance Partners, the Company agreed to pay the Seller total consideration of $2.0 million in cash and assume certain short-term and long-term liabilities of Alliance Partners. The primary reason for the purchase was to acquire FinZeo’s intellectual property, personnel, and software platform needed to board AppTech’s potential customers.

 

The Company closed the Transaction on October 26, 2023 (the “Closing Date”).

 

On October 31, 2023, the Company issued 1 million shares of its common stock to an entity owned by the Seller. In exchange for the shares, the Seller waived, cancelled, and forgave the long-term debt of FinZeo. Also, the entire FinZeo team elected to join the Company and certain employees received non-guaranteed stock options based on performance.

 

 

 

 

                                                                   9                                                                    

 

 

On December 28, 2023, the Parties entered into an Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “First Amendment”). The First Amendment amends the Purchase Agreement to change Section 2.2 and the terms under which the Cash Purchase Price shall be paid. Under the First Amendment, the Cash Purchase Price shall be paid, without setoff or deduction, by wire transfer or immediately available United States funds: On the Closing Date, $500,000 paid on October 27, 2023; on or before January 31, 2024, $375,000; on or before February 29, 2024, $375,000; on or before April 30, 2024, $375,000.

 

On January 31, 2024, the parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment modifies the Purchase Agreement, specifically revising the terms under which the Cash Purchase Price will be paid. According to the revised terms, $75,000 is due on or before January 31, 2024; $300,000 on or before February 29, 2024; and $375,000 on or before May 31, 2024.

 

On March 1, 2024, the Parties entered into an Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment amends the Purchase Agreement to change the terms under which the Cash Purchase Price shall be paid. Under the Third Amendment, the Cash Purchase Price on January 31, 2024, 75,000, was paid; and the remaining Purchase shall be paid, without setoff or deduction, by wire transfer or immediately available United States funds: On or before March 8, 2024, $75,000; on or before April 5, 2024, $75,000; on or before April 30, 2024, $150,000; on or before May 31, 2024, $375,000; on or before June 30, 2024, $375,000; on or before July 31, 2024, $375,000. Further, the Third Amendment provides that in consideration of modifying the payment schedule, the Seller will receive 15,000 shares of the Company, the payment terms will be reviewed in 60 days and any modifications will be mutually agreed upon.

 

On April 29, 2024, the Parties entered into an Amendment to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”) . This amendment modifies the terms under which the Cash Purchase Price is paid, including the $75,000 payment made on March 8, 2024, and the $150,000 due by June 21, 2024. Further payments are deferred under the conditions specified in the amendment, with subsequent payments outlined in the revised schedule. For specific payment details and conditions, refer to the previous disclosure.

 

The remaining outstanding payable as of March 31, 2024 is $1.35 million and the payable is secured by substantially all the Company’s assets.

 

Management’s Plan to Address Going Concern Considerations

 

The Company has experienced recurring operating losses, primarily due to limited revenues. The Company’s current financial conditions and recurring losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

 

In addition to an open S-3 filed with the SEC, management is actively pursuing additional funding options and is confident that two of its revenue streams will begin generating revenue during the following twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements, although no assurances can be made.

 

Management intends to maintain adequate working capital and adhere to prudent financial forecasting.

 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. Although management believes that the disclosures in these unaudited financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

 

The accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes related thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.

 

 

 

                                                                   10                                                                   

 

 

Basis of Consolidation

 

The consolidated unaudited financial statements include the accounts of AppTech Payments Corp., and wholly owned subsidiaries of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

 

The Company makes critical estimates and assumptions in valuing: stock-based awards, intangible assets and the related goodwill impairment test. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Prior Period Reclassifications

 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the Company reclassified 'Accounts Payable - Related Party' from 'Accounts Payable' within the consolidated balance sheet. As a result, 'Accounts Payable - Related Party' is presented separately as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000 per institution that pays Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance premiums. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances.

 

The accounts receivable from merchant services are paid by the financial institutions on a monthly basis. As of March 31, 2024, 88% of the accounts receivable balance was generated from three customers. As of December 31, 2023, the same three customers accounted for 96% of total accounts receivable.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, 87% of the revenue was generated from three customers. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the same three customers represented 89% of total revenues. The loss of the customer would have a significant impact on the Company's financials.

 

Software Development Costs 

 

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the development of its digital banking platform. Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable the development will result in new or additional functionality. The types of costs capitalized during the development phase include employee compensation and consulting fees for third party developers working on these projects. Costs related to the preliminary project planning phase and post implementation phase are expensed as incurred. The digital banking platform is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, codified as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.

 

The Company provides merchant processing solutions for credit cards and electronic payments. In all cases, the Company acts as an agent between the merchant which generates the credit card and electronic payments, and the bank, which processes such payments.

 

The Company’s revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee transaction, depending on the card or transaction type. Revenue is recorded as services are performed, which is typically when the bank processes the merchant’s credit card and electronic payments. Consideration paid to channel partners is recorded as a reduction in revenues.

 

Licensing Revenue

 

The Company is actively pursuing strategic partnership agreements that licenses our portfolio of patents in return for a fee. The licensing fee is deferred and recognized evenly on a monthly basis over the term of the service period or contract.

 

Intangible Assets and Intellectual Property

 

Intellectual Property

 

The Company amortizes intellectual property based on the estimated period over which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be consumed. Typically, the Company amortizes its intellectual property, including patents and other identifiable intangible assets, on a straight-line basis. The amortization periods generally range from three years to fifteen years, depending on the nature of the asset and its expected useful life. 

 

Capitalized Development Cost

 

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the development of its digital payment and banking platform. Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized only when we believe it is probable the development will result in new or additional functionality. The Company recorded the identifiable intangible assets, which included the acquired technology, intellectual property, and non-competes, at their acquisition-date fair value using a combination of the income and cost approaches. Costs related to the preliminary project planning phase and post implementation phase are expensed as incurred. The capitalized development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 

 

Goodwill 

 

The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value.

 

 

 

                                                                   12                                                                   

 

 

Research and Development

 

In accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development (“R&D”) costs are expensed when incurred. R&D costs include costs of acquiring patents and other unproven technologies, contractor fees and other costs associated with the development of the SMS short code texting platform, contract and other outside services. Total R&D costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively.

 

Per Share Information

 

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year, increased by the potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the year. Dilutive securities include stock options, warrants granted, and convertible preferred stock.

 

The number of common stock equivalents not included in diluted income per share was 11,245,422 and 7,210,767 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents is not included in diluted income (loss) per share, because the effects are anti-dilutive.

Stock Based Compensation

 

The Company recognizes as compensation expense all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors, and consultants, including grants of stock, stock options, and warrants, based on their estimated fair values. For stock awards, fair value is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and is recognized over the service period required for the employees, directors, and consultants to earn the awards. For stock options and warrants, fair value is estimated using an appropriate valuation model at the grant date, considering the terms and conditions under which the awards were granted. The expense is similarly recognized over the period during which the service conditions are expected to be met. Additionally, the Company has several grant agreements that include options awarded based on contingent performance. For these performance-based option grants, the Company records the fair market value of the options at the time the performance criteria are fully met.

 

New Accounting Pronouncements

 

The FASB issues ASUs to amend the authoritative literature in ASC. There have been a number of ASUs to date that amend the original text of ASC. The Company believes those issued to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable to the Company or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.

In March 2024, the Company and NCR reached a Settlement and Release Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”).

Each party expressly denies any liability, and nothing within this Settlement Agreement should be interpreted as an admission of liability by either party. No further other actions required by either party.

 

Infinios Financial Services (formerly NEC Payments B.S.C.)

 

On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Infinios Financial Services BSC (formally NEC Payments B.S.C) (“Infinios”) through a series of agreements, which included the following: (a) Subscription License and Services Agreement; (b) Digital Banking Platform Operating Agreement; (c) Subscription License Order Form; and (d) Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the “Agreements”).

 

 

 

                                                                   16                                                                   

 

 

On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Subscription License and Services Agreement, Digital Banking Platform Operating Agreement and Subscription License Order Form with Infinios (collectively, the “Restated Agreements”). The gross total fees due under the Restated Agreements are $2.2 million excluding pass-through costs associated with infrastructure hosting fees.

 

In the years of 2021 and 2022, the Company paid Infinios $1.8 million and issued to an Infinios’ affiliate about 2,347,905 shares of common stock of the Company.

 

On May 4, 2023, unsatisfied with Infinios’ performance of its contractual obligations, the Company notified Infinios of its intent to terminate its relationship and commenced a good-faith negotiation with Infinios regarding the termination terms.

 

In June 2023, Infinios turned off all its services, and the Company wrote off the $6.1 million net capitalized assets included in Capitalized software development and license and Prepaid license fees, as they were deemed to be impaired.

 

On or about October 5, 2023, Infinios filed a demand for arbitration and a Statement of Claim before the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, Case No. 01-23-0004-3881 (the “Arbitration Claim”). In the Arbitration Claim, Infinios asserts claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and account stated. Infinios alleges damages of $598,525, and asserts a demand for the grant and registration of shares.

 

On November 13, 2023, the Company filed an Answer to the Arbitration Claim, along with Counterclaims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 

At a Preliminary Hearing held on February 22, 2024, hearing dates of August 12 and 13, 2024, August 19 and 20, 2024, and October 21 and 22, 2024 were scheduled.

 

While the Company will continue to pursue consensual means of resolving this dispute, it intends to vigorously defend the claims in the Arbitration Claim, and prosecute the causes of action in its Counterclaims.

 

Terminated Employees

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company was engaged in ongoing negotiations regarding severance payments with three former employees. These employees have not complied fully with the contractual terms of their employment and separation agreements. This non-compliance leads the Company to assess that it is less likely than not that a severance obligation will be incurred. Given this assessment and the ongoing status of negotiations, the Company has determined that no accrual for severance payments is necessary at this time due to the uncertainty of the obligation. The outcome of these negotiations could lead to potential arbitration or litigation, the impact of which is currently indeterminate.

 

NOTE 8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 

 

Series A Preferred Stock

 

The Company is authorized to issue 10,526 shares of $0.001 par value Series A preferred stock (“Series A”). There were fourteen (14) shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to one vote per share on an “as converted” basis on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. The holders of Series A preferred stock are entitled to any dividends that may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available, therefore on a pro rata basis according to their holdings of shares of Series A preferred stock, on an as converted basis.

Public Offerings

 

In February 2023, the Company announced the closing of its previously announced $5.0 million registered direct offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) with a single institutional investor to sell 1,666,667 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) and warrants to purchase up to 1,666,667 shares (the “Warrants”) in a concurrent private placement (the “Private Placement”). The combined purchase price for one Share and one Warrant was $3.00. Each of the Warrants has an exercise price of $4.64 per share of common stock and are exercisable on and after August 1, 2023. The Warrants expire five years from the date on which they become exercisable. The aggregate gross proceeds from the Registered Direct Offering and the concurrent Private Placement were approximately $5.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses. The offering that was completed in February 2023, caused a reset to the exercise price of existing warrants from the S-1 offering that had a strike price of $5.19 and a future offerings floor price of $4.15. Accordingly, the floor price was reset to $4.15 in February 2023. 4,156,626 warrants were reset and $763 thousand was recorded to additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit as a result of the reset.

 

In August 2023, the Company entered into a sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $18.0 million through “at-the-market” offerings (ATM), pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. In total, as of the end of March 31, 2024, the Company sold 898,780 shares of common stock under the ATM, for which the Company received net proceeds of $2.1 million, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses.

 

In October 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with a certain accredited and institutional investor (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Company has agreed to issue and sell to Purchaser an aggregate of: (i) 1,666,667 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and (ii) warrants (the “Purchase Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,666,667 shares of Common Stock, exercisable at $2.74 per share (the “Offering”). The offering price per Share and associated Purchase Warrants is $2.10. The October Warrants will expire five years from the date on which they become exercisable. On October 26, 2023, the Company closed the Offering and raised $3.5 million in gross proceeds from the Offering.

 

On March 26, 2024, AppTech Payments Corp. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with EF Hutton LLC, as representative of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), relating to the public offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), at a purchase price per share to the public of $1.00 (the “Offering Price”). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at the Offering Price, less any underwriting discounts and commissions, for use solely in covering any over-allotments.

 

 

 

                                                                   18                                                                   

 

 

As of March 31, 2024, approximately $61.9 million remains available under the shelf registration statement Form S-3 (File No. 333-265526) previously filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 15, 2022. SEC regulations limit the amount of funds we can raise during any 12-month period pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are currently limited by the Baby Shelf Rule as of the filing of this Annual Report, until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million. However, factors such as stock price, volatility, trading volume, market conditions, demand and regulatory requirements may adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise capital in an efficient manner.

 

Stock Issued for Services

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company issued 40,000 and 150,000, respectively, shares of common stock to several consultants in connection with business development and professional services. The Company valued the common stock issuances at $60 thousand and $466 thousand, respectively, based upon the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the agreement.

 

Stock Issued related to Acquisition

 

On October 26, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed acquisition of Alliance Partners, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Alliance Partners”, “FinZeo”). On October 31, 2023, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $2.44 per share to an entity owned by the Seller. In exchange for the shares, the Seller waived, cancelled, and forgave the long-term debt of FinZeo. Also, the entire FinZeo team elected to join AppTech and certain employees received non-guaranteed stock options based on performance.

 

On March 1, 2024, the Company issued 15,000 shares of common stock valued at $1.75 per share to the former owner of Alliance Partners, LLC as consideration for extending the payment due date for the remaining balance due of the acquisition consideration.

 

See Note 1 - Purchase of Alliance Partners, LLC.

 

Stock Options 

 

The Company grants stock options as part of employee compensation and recognizes these options’ expense over the vesting period. If an employee does not meet certain conditions such as sales targets or leaves the Company before the options vest, these options are forfeited as they occur.

 

On December 7, 2021, the board authorized the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan in order to facilitate the grant of equity incentives to employees (including our named executive officers), directors, independent contractors, merchants, referral partners, channel partners and employees of our company to enable our company to attract, retain and motivate employees, directors, merchants, referral partners and channel partners, which is essential to our long-term success. The shareholders approved an additional 700,000 shares for the Company’s Equity Incentive plan in May 2023. A total of 1,752,632 shares of common stock were authorized under the Equity Incentive Plan, for which as of March 31, 2024, a total of 378,364 are available for issuance.

 

On October 26, 2023, the Company acquired FinZeo, a Nevada based LLC. As part of the acquisition of FinZeo, the previous management team received 1.5 million options of AppTech’s common stock, with vesting contingent upon reaching specified sales milestones. The options would be forfeited if they left the Company prior to achieving their target. The Company did not record any stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as these were not determined to be probable of vesting. See Note 1 - Purchase of Alliance Partners, LLC.

On March 20, 2024, the Company extended the expiration term of vested and outstanding stock options to 10 years from the original grant date for current employees and consultants. The fair value was calculated both on the modification date and prior to the modification. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded the option modification expense of $325 thousand.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company granted 1,028,750 options to purchase of common stock. The grants included:

 

1) 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a consultant, with vesting contingent upon reaching specified sales milestones. The fair value of these options, which are non-plan with a one-year life, will be recognized as an expense when vesting appears probable. These options have an exercise price of $1.58 per share and a fair value of $0.64 per share on the issuance date. The Company did not record any stock based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as these were not determined to be probable of vesting.

Revenue

 

Revenue was approximately $105 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $89 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of 18%. The increase was principally driven by the new licensing revenue and offset by lower merchant processing revenue.

 

Cost of Revenue

 

Cost of revenue was approximately $11 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $53 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 79%. The decrease was principally driven by lower transaction volume, and the licensing revenue has no corresponding costs of revenue.

 

General and Administrative Expenses

 

General and administrative expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.1 million or the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $408 thousand or 20%. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees.

 

Research and Development Expenses

 

Research and development expenses were approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $881 thousand or 58%. The decrease was primarily due to lower stock based compensation of $588 thousand, lower payroll and benefit of $605 thousand, and offset by higher outsourced development consultants of $294 thousand.

 

Interest Expense, net

 

Interest expense, net was approximately $3 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $46 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 93%. The decrease was primarily due to the Company's repayment of forbearance loan and interest in February 2023.

 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability

 

Change in fair value of derivative liability was approximately $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $27 thousand for the year ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 100%. The decrease was primarily due to the Company's settlement of the notes and warrants that contained the embedded derivative liabilities in April 2023.

 

Other income (expenses)

 

Other income was approximately $3 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to approximately $430 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by $430 thousand gain from cancellation of stock repurchase liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

In March 2024, AppTech Payments Corp. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with EF Hutton LLC, as representative of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), relating to the public offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), at a purchase price per share to the public of $1.00 (the “Offering Price”). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at the Offering Price, less any underwriting discounts and commissions, for use solely in covering any over-allotments.

 

In August 2023, the Company entered into a sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $18.0 million through “at-the-market” offerings (ATM), pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold 423,180 shares of common stock under the ATM, for which the Company received net proceeds of $701 thousand, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has sold a total of 898,780 shares of common stock under the ATM, for which the Company received net proceeds of $2.1 million, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses.

 

As of March 31, 2024, approximately $61.9 million remains available under the shelf registration statement Form S-3 (File No. 333-265526) previously filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 15, 2022. SEC regulations limit the amount of funds we can raise during any 12-month period pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are currently limited by the Baby Shelf Rule as of the filing of this Annual Report, until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million. However, factors such as stock price, volatility, trading volume, market conditions, demand and regulatory requirements may adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise capital in an efficient manner.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 million, working capital of negative $2.3 million, and stockholders’ equity of approximately $4.1 million.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we met our immediate cash requirements through existing cash balances, public offerings, and “at-the-market” offerings (ATM). See Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity.

 

Additionally, we used equity and equity-linked instruments to pay for services and compensation.

 

 

                                                                   26                                                                   

 

 

Management's Plan to Address Going Concern Considerations

 

The Company has experienced recurring operating losses, primarily due to limited revenues. The Company's current financial conditions and recurring losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

 

In addition to an open S-3 filed with the SEC, management is actively pursuing additional funding options and is confident that two of its revenue streams will begin generating revenue in the following twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements.

 

Management intends to maintain adequate working capital and adhere to prudent financial forecasting.

 

Cash Flows

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant estimates include those related to the valuation of goodwill impairment and intangible assets, and equity-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current conditions. It’s important to note that actual results could differ from these estimates.

 

Critical accounting policies are those that we consider the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. The accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below. As of March 31, 2024, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates nor to our recently issued accounting pronouncements, except as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

 

Equity-Based Compensation: We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires input of subjective assumptions. The model inputs include expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The assumptions about future stock price volatility and the option’s expected term involve significant judgments based on historical data and future expectations. The reported equity-based compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the volatility assumption. An increase in expected volatility could materially impact the amount of compensation expense recognized.

 

Business Combination

 

Recognition and Measurement: Companies must recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date.

 

Goodwill: Arises when the consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. It represents future economic benefits arising from assets that are not individually identified and separately recognized.

 

Intangible Assets: Identifiable intangible assets, distinguishable either by separability from the acquired entity or through contractual or other legal rights, are valued and reported independently from goodwill. These assets include, but are not limited to, trademarks, customer relationships, proprietary technology, and patents. The fair value of these intangible assets is determined at the time of acquisition and is subject to subsequent impairment tests.

 

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is estimated using income, market, or cost approach methods. The income approach, often applied through the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the asset and discounting them to present value using a discount rate that reflects the risk associated with those cash flows. The estimation of fair value is inherently uncertain due to the assumptions and judgments involved in projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, and estimating the useful life of each asset.

 

Over the reporting period, changes in market conditions, technological advancements, or strategic shifts in the business may necessitate revisions to the assumptions used in the valuation of identifiable intangible assets. Management closely monitors these factors and will adjust the valuation of intangible assets as appropriate, reflecting the impact of any such changes in our financial statements.

 

Contingent Consideration: Any contingent consideration, such as earn-outs, is measured at fair value at the acquisition date and can be adjusted in subsequent periods if the fair value changes.

 

 

 

                                                                   28                                                                   

 

 

Goodwill Impairment 

 

Goodwill Impairment Testing: The process requires an annual test for impairment of goodwill, and more frequent testing if certain indicators suggest that the goodwill might be impaired. This assessment involves comparing the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value. Key estimates in determining fair value include: a) Cash Flow Projections: Utilizing the DCF method, management estimates future cash flows based on current performance, business plans, and expected market growth, introducing judgment due to forecasting uncertainties. b) Discount Rate: The discount rate, reflecting the WACC and adjusted for unit-specific risks, is crucial for present value calculations, with changes significantly affecting fair value estimations; c) Long-term Growth Rates: Assumptions on sustainable growth rates impact the terminal value in the DCF model, thus influencing the overall fair value of the reporting unit.

 

Impairment Loss Calculation: The impairment loss, representing the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value, is highly sensitive to the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value calculation. Small changes in cash flow projections, discount rates, or long-term growth rates can result in significant adjustments to the impairment loss recognized in the income statement. Given the dynamic nature of business conditions, technological advancements, and market competition, estimates used in goodwill impairment testing may change from one period to another. Management is tasked with regularly reviewing and updating these estimates to reflect the latest available information and market conditions.

 

Once an impairment loss is recognized, it is not reversible in subsequent periods. This finality places additional importance on the accuracy and reasonableness of the underlying estimates and assumptions.

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

Our company evaluates long-lived assets, including capitalized software, for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This process involves comparing the carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the expected cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the asset’s carrying amount to its fair value.

 

Indicators of impairment include significant underperformance against projections, market or economic downturns, and technological obsolescence. The fair value is determined using market data or discounted cash flow models. An impairment loss is recorded as an expense immediately.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

As of March 31, 2024, there have been no significant changes to our recently issued accounting pronouncements, except as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

 

Because we are allowed to comply with the disclosure obligations applicable to a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with respect to this Form 10-Q, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.

 

 

 

                                                                   29                                                                   

 

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

 

Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - Other Information

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

 

NCR Lawsuit

 

On November 30, 2022, AppTech filed a complaint against NCR Payment Solutions, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging Breach of Contract, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Specific Performance and Accounting. NCR filed a motion to dismiss, motion to transfer venue and motion to compel arbitration.

 

In March 2024, the Company and NCR reached a Settlement and Release Agreement ("Settlement Agreement"). Both parties affirm that this agreement is solely for settlement purposes and does not imply any admission of liability. Each party expressly denies any liability, and nothing within this Settlement Agreement should be interpreted as an admission of liability by either party. No further other actions required by either party.

 

Infinios Financial Services (formerly NEC Payments B.S.C.)

 

On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Infinios Financial Services BSC (formally NEC Payments B.S.C) (“Infinios”) through a series of agreements, which included the following: (a) Subscription License and Services Agreement; (b) Digital Banking Platform Operating Agreement; (c) Subscription License Order Form; and (d) Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the “Agreements”).

 

On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Subscription License and Services Agreement, Digital Banking Platform Operating Agreement and Subscription License Order Form with Infinios (collectively, the “Restated Agreements”). The gross total fees due under the Restated Agreements are $2.2 million excluding pass-through costs associated with infrastructure hosting fees.

 

In the years of 2021 and 2022, the Company paid Infinios $1.8 million and issued to an Infinios’ affiliate about 1,895,948 shares of common stock of the Company.

 

On May 4, 2023, unsatisfied with Infinios’ performance of its contractual obligations, the Company notified Infinios of its intent to terminate its relationship and commenced a good-faith negotiation with Infinios regarding the termination terms.

 

In June 2023, Infinios turned off all its services, and the Company wrote off the $6.1 million net capitalized asset as it was deemed to be impaired.

 

On or about October 5, 2023, Infinios filed a demand for arbitration and a Statement of Claim before the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, Case No. 01-23-0004-3881 (the “Arbitration Claim”). In the Arbitration Claim, Infinios asserts claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and account stated. Infinios alleges damages of $598,525, and asserts a demand for the grant and registration of shares.

 

On November 13, 2023, the Company filed an Answer to the Arbitration Claim, along with Counterclaims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 

At a Preliminary Hearing held on February 22, 2024, hearing dates of August 12 and 13, 2024, August 19 and 20, 2024, and October 21 and 22, 2024 were scheduled.

 

While the Company will continue to pursue consensual means of resolving this dispute, it intends to vigorously defend the claims in the Arbitration Claim, and prosecute the causes of action in its Counterclaims.

Former Employees

 

In May 2024, the Company received a notification of a lawsuit filed by three former employees seeking severance payments. Upon assessing the merits of the case, the Company has determined that the likelihood of loss is less than likely, as the employees failed to fulfill certain contractual obligations. The Company remains committed to vigorously defending its position and will continue to closely monitor developments in this case.
