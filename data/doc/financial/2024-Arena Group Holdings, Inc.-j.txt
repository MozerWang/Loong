Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, future revenues, market growth, capital requirements, product introductions, the timing, outcome or financial impacts of the pending Business Combination (as described in Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 herein) and related transactions, expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding. Other statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical facts are also forward-looking statements. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and other stylistic variants denoting forward-looking statements.

 

We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Quarterly Report, or that we may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on information currently available, as well as our beliefs and assumptions. The actual outcome related to forward-looking statements will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based only on known results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. We detail other risks in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The discussion in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

This Quarterly Report and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report except as may be required by law.

 

                                                                   3

THE ARENA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(unaudited) 

($ in thousands, unless otherwise stated)

 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“The Arena Group” or the “Company”), after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions.

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete audited financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in The Arena Group’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024, and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited but, in management’s opinion, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year.

 

The Company’s business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets and the general condition of the United States and world economy. A host of factors beyond the Company’s control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse developments in these general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and the results of its operations.

 

In addition, the Company will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded projects, marketing and sales operations as well as extensive human capital. The Company may be unable to compete successfully against these companies. The Company’s industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and market demands. As a result, the Company’s products, services, or expertise may become obsolete or unmarketable. The Company’s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to technological advances, anticipate customer and market demands, and enhance its current technology under development.

 

Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to the Company’s business. Increases in inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the responses thereto, and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. While the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of its business, the ultimate extent of the impact on its business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of the Company’s control and could exist for an extended period of time. As a result, the Company is subject to continuing risks and uncertainties.

 

The Company operates in one reportable segment.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

Going Concern

 

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $12,720, and as of March 31, 2024, had cash on hand of $4,003 and a working capital deficit of $225,009. The Company’s net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due. Also, since the Company’s 2023 Notes (see Note 11), Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes (see Note 12) (collectively its “current debt”) are subject to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) September 30, 2024; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (as further described in Note 18) unless the Company is able to refinance or modify the terms of its current debt it runs the risk that its debt could be called, therefore, it may not be able to meet its obligations when due.

 

In its evaluation, management determined there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless it is able to refinance or modify its current debt and complete the Business Combination.

 

The Company plans to refinance or modify the maturities of its current debt and complete the Business Combination to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance or modify its current debt and complete the Business Combination.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period. Significant estimates include: reserves for bad debt; capitalization of platform development and associated useful lives; goodwill and other acquired intangible assets and associated useful lives; assumptions used in accruals for potential liabilities; revenue recognition and estimates of standalone selling price of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations; stock-based compensation and the determination of the fair value; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; accounting for business combinations; and assumptions used to calculate contingent liabilities. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

 

In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This update also clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction and requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The adoption of ASU 2022-03 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

                                                                   11



 

 

Loss per Common Share

 

Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as stock options, restricted stock, and warrants. All restricted stock awards are considered outstanding but are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. All restricted stock units are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. Contingently issuable shares are included in basic loss per common share only when there are no circumstances under which those shares would not be issued. Diluted loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

 

The Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below (capitalized terms are described herein), which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock, from its calculation of net loss per common share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the diluted calculations when a net loss is incurred as they would be anti-dilutive.

3. Acquisitions

 

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which is based on ASC, Business Combinations (Topic 805), and uses the fair value concepts which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.

 

Teneology, Inc. – On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Teneology, Inc., (“Teneology”) pursuant to which it acquired certain assets (consisting of the RoadFood media business, including digital and television assets; the Moveable Feast media business, including digital and television assets; the Fexy-branded content studio business; and the MonkeySee YouTube Channel media business, collectively “Fexy Studios”), for a purchase price of $3,307. The purchase price consisted of the following: (1) $500 cash paid at closing (including an advance payment of $250 prior to closing); (2) $75 deferred cash payments due in three equal installments of $25 on March 1, 2023 (paid), April 1, 2023 (paid) and May 1, 2023 (paid); (3) $200 deferred cash payment due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to certain indemnity provisions (not paid in January 2024); and (4) the issuance of 274,692 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain lock-up provisions, with a fair value of $2,000 on the transaction closing date (fair value was determined based on an independent appraisal); and which was subject to a put option under certain conditions (the “contingent consideration”) with a final vesting date of January 11, 2024 (further details for (3) and (4) are provided in Note 9). The number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued was determined based on a $2,225 value using the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the January 11, 2023 closing date (on the closing date the common stock trading price was $7.94 per share). The agreement also provided for a cash retention pool for certain employees of $300, subject to vesting over three years upon continued employment and other conditions.

 

The composition of the purchase price is as follows:

The Company accounted for the asset acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 since the acquisition met the definition of a business under the applicable guidance.

 

The Company incurred $99 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

Summary of Preliminary Assets Purchase Price Allocation

Advertiser relationships                                                                                         $                663 

Brand names                                                                                                                       659 

Goodwill                                                                                                                        1,985 

Net assets acquired                                                                                              $              3,307 

 

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the advertiser relationships were valued using the excess earnings method of the income approach and the brand names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The estimated useful life is fifteen years (15.0 years) for the advertiser relationships and twelve years (12.0 years) for the brand names.

 

The excess-of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. The Company expects $1,678 of goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.

 

Further details are provided under the heading Intangible Assets in Note 4 related to an impairment of intangible assets (i.e., the advertiser relationships and brand names).

 

                                                                   14



 

 

Supplemental Pro forma Information

 

The pro forma disclosures have been deemed impracticable for this acquisition since after making reasonable efforts the Company is unable to accept assumptions made by Teneology. The Company has determined, based on the information provided by Teneology and made available to the Company, that the earnings from the prior periods could not be verified since the acquisition only included certain activities of Teneology and financial statements were not available. In this regard, the Company: (1) made reasonable effort to obtain certain financial results of the certain activities but Teneology was unable to comply with this request; and (2) the presentation of the pro forma results and the assumptions made by Teneology management were unable to be independently substantiated.

 

4. Balance Sheet Components

 

The components of certain balance sheet amounts are as follows:

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – The Company receives payments from advertising customers based upon contractual payment terms; accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected within 90 days. The Company generally receives payments from digital and print subscription customers at the time of sign up for each subscription; accounts receivable from merchant credit card processors are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected weekly. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued. Accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of $26,452 and $31,676, respectively, are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts.

7. Line of Credit

 

Line of Credit – In connection with the Arena Notes Default (as further described below in Note 18) there was a cross-default under the SLR Digital Finance LLC (“SLR” and the “SLR Default”) financing and security agreement for a line of credit (the “Line of Credit”), where the Line of Credit, as amended, was terminated. In connection with the termination, the Company paid SLR $3,448, representing the amount due on the outstanding loan balance, accrued interest, certain fees and contingency reserves other fees in connection with the termination. In connection with the SLR Default, SLR no longer provided funding under the Line of Credit while paying down the Line of Credit with payments received from the Company’s customers in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the Line of Credit was $19,609.

 

The Company has refinanced the Line of Credit with a new credit facility with Simplify Inventions, LLC (“Simplify”), as further described in Note 10.

 

Information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 with respect to interest expense related to the Line of Credit is provided under the heading Interest Expense in Note 12.

 

8. Liquidated Damages Payable

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the short-term liquidated damages payable were $3,000 and $2,924, respectively. The Company will continue to accrue interest on the liquidated damages balance at 1.0% per month based on the balance outstanding as of March 31, 2024, or $3,000, until paid. There is no scheduled date when the unpaid liquidated damages become due. The Series K convertible preferred stock remains subject to Registration Rights Damages and Public Information Failure Damages, which will accrue in certain circumstances, limited to 6% of the aggregate amount invested.

 

On February 8, 2023, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with an investor, where the Company was liable for liquidated damages, pursuant to which the Company issued 47,252 shares of its common stock at a price equal to $10.56 per share (determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock at the close of trading on the ninety (60) previous trading days), to the investor in lieu of an aggregate of $499 owed in liquidated damages as of the conversion date. On February 10, 2023, the Company issued 35,486 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of the liquidated damages, with the remaining shares issued after March 31, 2023. The Company prepared and filed a registration statement covering the resale of these shares of the Company’s common stock issued in lieu of payment of these liquidated damages in cash. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded $324 in connection with the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock and a gain of $46 on the settlement of the liquidated damages, totaling $370, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficiency.

 

9. Fair Value

 

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies the Company believes to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company would realize upon disposition.

 

                                                                   20



 

 

The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, which are described below:

 

Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and

Level 3. Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which result in the use of management estimates.

 

The Company accounted for certain common stock issued in connection with the Fexy Studios acquisition that is subject to a put option (the “Fexy Put Option”), which provides for a cash payment to the sellers on the first anniversary date of the closing (on January 11, 2024) in the event the common stock trading price on such date is less than the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the acquisition date of $8.10 per share, as a derivative liability, which requires the Company to carry such amounts on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a liability at fair value, as adjusted at each reporting period-end.

 

Fexy Put Option – On February 15, 2024, in connection with the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Fexy Studios, the Company agreed to pay the amount due of $2,478 in four (4) equal installments of approximately $620 starting February 16, 2024 (paid $620 in February 2024) and then on the 15th day of each March (paid $620 in March 2024), April (paid $620 in April 2024) and May (paid $620 in May 2024) of 2024 comprised of the following: (i) $2,225 pursuant to the Fexy Put Option where the Company gave the recipients of the contingent consideration a right to put their 274,692 shares of the Company’s common stock; (ii) $200 deferred payment due under the purchase agreement; and (iii) $53 in other costs and reimbursable transition expenses payable. As of March 31, 2024, the Company owed $1,238 on the Fexy Put Option as reflected in accounts payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company recorded the repurchase of 274,692 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the acquisition, resulting in a loss of $379 as reflected on the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders’ deficiency.

 

Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023:

                                                                     for Identical         Observable               Inputs

                                                                         Assets              Inputs               (Level 3)

                                                                       (Level 1)           (Level 2)

Contingent consideration                         $        1,571   $                 -   $          1,571   $                     - 

 

Contingent Consideration – The fair value of the contingent consideration was primarily dependent on the common stock trading price on the first anniversary of the closing of Fexy Studios, or January 11, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value was calculated based on the $8.10 put option amount based on the exercise price of the Company’s common stock at the acquisition date, less the $2.38 the Company’s common stock trading price as of the reporting date, or $5.72 per share, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the put option of 274,692, which approximated the value if the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used given the proximity date of the put option.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the change in valuation of the contingent consideration of $313 and $499, respectively, was recognized in other expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

10. Simplify Loan

 

On March 13, 2024, the Company entered into a working capital loan agreement with Simplify, a related party as further described in Note 18 (the “Simplify Loan”), pursuant to which the Company has available up to $25,000 at ten percent (10.0%) interest rate per annum (the “Applicable Interest Rate”), payable monthly in arrears unless otherwise demanded by Simplify, with a maturity on March 13, 2026. The Simplify Loan is secured by certain assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are also guarantors of the obligations. Upon the closing, the Company borrowed $7,748, of which $3,448 was used to repay the outstanding loan balance, accrued interest, certain fees and contingency reserves under the Line of Credit. In the event of a default, including but not limited to the failure to pay any amounts when due, the interest will accrue at the Applicable Interest Rate plus five percent (5.0%) and the Simplify Loan will be payable upon demand by Simplify. As of March 31, 2024, the balance outstanding on the Simplify Loan was $7,748.

 

Information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, with respect to interest expense related to the Simplify Loan is provided under the heading Interest Expense in Note 12.

 

                                                                   21

The provisions of the First Amendment also permit certain incremental borrowings in the amount up to $3,000 at the sole discretion of the purchaser (the “Incremental 2023 Notes”), subject to a minimum amount of $1,000 and other conditions. On September 29, 2023, the Company issued $1,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes pursuant to the incremental borrowings.

Modification of Warrants – On January 2, 2024, in connection with the default under the Licensing Agreement, the Performance-Based Warrants totaling 599,724 vested as a result of the default pursuant to certain provisions where all of the warrants automatically vest upon certain terminations of the Licensing Agreement by ABG. Of the warrants that vested, 449,793 had an exercise price of $9.24 per share and 149,931 had an exercise price of $18.48 per share.

 

Modification of Awards – On February 28, 2023, the Company modified certain equity awards as a result of the resignation of a senior executive employee where 38,026 restricted stock units with time-based vesting that were unvested were vested and 21,117 options for shares of the Company’s common stock with time-based vesting that were unvested were vested, each subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and certain other provisions. In connection with the modification of these equity awards, the Company agreed to purchase a options exercisable for 45,632 shares of the Company’s common stock (including previously vested options of shares of the Company’s common stock of 24,515) as of the resignation date of the employee at a price of $10.29 per share, reduced by the exercise price and required tax withholdings, subject to certain conditions. The modification of the equity awards resulted in the unamortized costs being recognized at the modification date. The cash price of $10.29 per option less the strike price of $8.82 per option resulted in incremental cost of $68 being recognized at the modification date. The modification resulted in liability classification of the equity awards, with $68 paid during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Contract Balances

 

The timing of the Company’s performance under its various contracts often differs from the timing of the customer’s payment, which results in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability. A contract asset is recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer and the Company does not have the contractual right to bill for the related performance obligations. A contract liability is recognized when consideration is received from the customer prior to the transfer of goods or services.

 

The following table provides information about contract balances:

Unearned Revenue – Unearned revenue, also referred to as contract liabilities, include payments received in advance of performance under certain contracts and are recognized as revenue over time. The Company records contract liabilities as unearned revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 

17. Income Taxes

 

The provision for income taxes in interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company’s annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of its annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The quarterly provision for income taxes, and estimate of the Company’s annual effective tax rate, are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in pre-tax income (or loss), the mix of jurisdictions to which such income relates, changes in how the Company conducts business, and tax law developments.

 

The income tax provision (benefit) effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 0.32% and 0.04%, respectively. The deferred income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangible assets.

 

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. Based upon the Company’s historical operating losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against most of the deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has no uncertain tax positions or interest and penalties accrued.

 

                                                                   28

Principal Stockholder

 

Arena Loan Agreement – On January 5, 2024, as part of negotiations with Renew Group Private Limited (“Renew”), an affiliated entity of Simplify, in connection with the Company’s failure on December 29, 2023 to make the interest payment due on the loan agreement (the “Arena Loan Agreement”), dated December 15, 2022 held by Renew (the “Arena Notes”) in the amount of $2,797, that resulted in an event of default under the Arena Notes (the “Arena Notes Default”), Renew agreed in writing to a forbearance period through March 29, 2024 (subsequently extended to April 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024), subject to the Company retaining a chief restructuring officer acceptable to Renew, while reserving its rights and remedies. In connection with the forbearance, the Company had an engagement with FTI Consulting Inc., (“FTI”) from January 5, 2024 through April 26, 2024, a global business advisory firm, to assist the Company with its turnaround plans and forge an expedited path to sustainable positive cash flow and earnings to create shareholder value (the “FTI Engagement”). In connection with the FTI Engagement, Jason Frankl, a senior managing director of FTI, was appointed as the Company’s Chief Business Transformation Officer. He was later appointed as the interim Co-President. Upon completion of their work under the FTI Engagement satisfactory to Renew and the Company, the FTI Engagement was terminated as of April 26, 2024 and Mr. Frankl resigned as Co-President and Chief Business Transformation Officer. The outstanding principal on the Arena Notes was $110,691 ($8,000 for the 2023 Notes and $102,691 for the Debt) as of March 31, 2024 and the forbearance period was further extended on April 29, 2024 (as further described below) through September 30, 2024.

Prior to the consummation of the Private Placement, the Company’s public stockholders held a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The funds used by Simplify to purchase the Private Placement Shares came from the working capital of Simplify.

Further, concurrently with the closing of the Mergers, pursuant to that certain Committed Equity Facility Term Sheet, dated November 5, 2023, by and between Arena and Simplify, New Arena will enter into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Simplify, pursuant to which Simplify will agree to purchase, at New Arena’s request, up to $20,000 in aggregate purchase price of shares of New Arena Common Stock from time to time during the 12 months following the closing date at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the volume-weighted average price of the New Arena Common Stock for the last sixty trading days prior to the purchase date and (ii) $3.86 per share (the “Equity Line of Credit”), along with 60,000 shares of New Arena Common Stock as payment of a 1.5% commitment fee.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements.”

 

Overview

 

We are a media company that leverages technology to build deep content verticals powered by anchor brands and a best-in-class digital media platform (the “Platform”) empowering publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. Our strategy is to focus on key subject matter verticals where audiences are passionate about a topic category (e.g., sports and finance) where we can leverage the strength of our core brands to grow our audience and increase monetization both within our core brands as well as for our media publisher partners(each, a “Publisher Partner”). Our focus is on leveraging our Platform and brands in targeted verticals to maximize audience reach, enhance engagement, and optimize monetization of digital publishing assets for the benefit of our users, our advertiser clients, and our greater than 40 owned and operated properties as well as properties we run on behalf of independent Publisher Partners. We own and operate Athlon Sports, TheStreet, The Spun, Parade, and Men’s Journal and power more than 360 independent Publisher Partners, including the many sports team sites that contribute to Athlon Sports.

 

Each Publisher Partner joins the Platform by invitation only with the objective of improving our position in key verticals while optimizing the performance of the Publisher Partner. Publisher Partners incur the costs in content creation on their respective channels and receive a share of the revenue associated with their content. Because of the state-of-the-art technology and large scale of the Platform and our expertise in search engine optimization, social media, ad monetization and subscription marketing, Publisher Partners continually benefit from our ongoing technological advances and audience development expertise. Additionally, we believe the lead brands within our verticals create a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While the Publisher Partners benefit from these critical performance improvements they may also save substantial technology, infrastructure, advertising sales, member marketing and management costs.

 

Of the more than 360 Publisher Partners, a large majority of them publish content within one of our four verticals of sports, finance, lifestyle and men’s lifestyle, and oversee an online community for their respective sites, leveraging our Platform, monetization operation, distribution channels and data and analytics offerings and benefiting from our ability to engage the collective audiences within a single network. Generally, Publisher Partners are independently owned, strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. Audiences expand and advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Publisher Partners into a single platform and a large and experienced sales organization. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue.

 

Our growth strategy is to continue adding new Publisher Partners in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on the Platform.

 

                                                                   32



 

 

Recent Developments

 

On February 9, 2024, New Arena Holdco, Inc. (“New Arena”), a wholly owned subsidiary of us, filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-276999) with the SEC in connection with the Business Combination Agreement by and among us, Simplify Inventions, LLC (“Simplify”), Bridge Media Networks, LLC (“Bridge Media”), New Arena and the other parties dated November 5, 2023, as amended on December 1, 2023 (the “Transaction Agreement”), that provides for us to combine our operations with those of Bridge Media, a wholly owned subsidiary of Simplify by way of a series of mergers with and among New Arena (the “Mergers”), subject to customary conditions, including the approval by our shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. Immediately following the Mergers, the Transaction Agreement provides for: (i) the purchase by The Hans Foundation USA, a nonprofit nonstock corporation (the “Hans Foundation”) of 25,000 shares of New Arena Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 pursuant to the subscription agreement, dated as of November 5, 2023, by and between New Arena and the Hans Foundation; and (ii) the purchase by 5-Hour International Corporation Pte.

Further, concurrently with the closing of the Mergers, pursuant to that certain Committed Equity Facility Term Sheet, dated November 5, 2023, by and between New Arena and Simplify, New Arena will enter into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Simplify, pursuant to which Simplify will agree to purchase, at New Arena’s request, up to $20,000 in aggregate purchase price of shares of New Arena Common Stock from time to time during the 12 months following the closing date at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the volume-weighted average price of the New Arena Common Stock for the last sixty trading days prior to the purchase date and (ii) $3.86 per share (the “Equity Line of Credit”), along with 60,000 shares of New Arena Common Stock as payment of a 1.5% commitment fee.

 

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions

 

Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to our business. Increases in inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the responses thereto, and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of our business, the ultimate extent of the impact on our business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of our control and could exist for an extended period of time. As a result, we are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report.

 

Key Operating Metrics

 

Our key operating metrics are:

 

     ●    Revenue per page view (“RPM”) – represents the advertising revenue earned per 1,000 pageviews. It is calculated as our

           advertising revenue during a period divided by our total page views during that period and multiplied by $1,000;

           and

 

     ●    Monthly average pageviews – represents the total number of pageviews in a given month or the average of each month’s

           pageviews in a fiscal quarter or year, which is calculated as the total number of page views recorded in a quarter or year

           divided by three months or 12 months,

           respectively.

 

We monitor and review our key operating metrics as we believe that these metrics are relevant for our industry and specifically to us and to understanding our business. Moreover, they form the basis for trends informing certain predictions related to our financial condition. Our key operating metrics focus primarily on our digital advertising revenue, which has experienced significant growth in recent periods. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, digital advertising revenue increased by 19.1%, as compared to the same period in 2023 as indicated in the Results of Operations section below. Management monitors and reviews these metrics because such metrics are readily measurable in real time and can provide valuable insight into the performance of and trends related to our digital advertising revenue and our overall business. We consider only those key operating metrics described here to be material to our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

 

                                                                   33



 

 

For pricing indicators, we focus on RPM as it is the pricing metric most closely aligned with monthly average pageviews. RPM is an indicator of yield and pricing driven by both advertising density and demand from our advertisers.

 

Monthly average pageviews are measured across all properties hosted on the Platform and provide us with insight into volume, engagement and effective page management and are therefore our primary measure of traffic. We utilize a third-party source, Google Analytics, to confirm this traffic data.

 

As described above, these key operating metrics are critical for management as they provide insights into our digital advertising revenue generation and overall business performance. This information also provides feedback on the content on our website and its ability to attract and engage users, which allows us to make strategic business decisions designed to drive more users to read or view more of our content and generate higher advertising revenue across all properties hosted on the Platform.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our RPM was $19.99 and $14.56, respectively. The 37.29% increase in RPM reflects a significant increase in video advertising as a percentage of total digital advertising as digital video advertising is sold at a significantly higher price than digital display advertising. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our monthly average pageviews were 399,683,984 and 397,094,535, respectively. The 0.65% increase in monthly average pageviews reflects algorithmic changes at Google, Facebook and other platforms which subdued user click-throughs to the original content.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Going Concern

 

Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $12,720, and as of March 31, 2024, had cash on hand of $4,003 and a working capital deficit of $225,009. Our net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet our obligations when due. Also, since our 2023 Notes (see Note 11 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes (see Note 12 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) (collectively our “current debt”) are subject to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) September 30, 2024; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (as further described in Note 18 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) unless we are able to refinance or modify the terms of our current debt we run the risk that our debt could be called, therefore, we may not be able to meet our obligations when due.

 

In our evaluation, management determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the (unaudited) condensed consolidated financial statement issuance date, unless we are able to refinance or modify our current debt and complete the Business Combination.

 

We plan to refinance or modify the maturities of our current debt and complete the Business Combination to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or modify our current debt and complete the Business Combination.

 

                                                                   34



 

 

Cash and Working Capital Facility

 

As of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of $4,003 and accounts receivable from continuing operations, net of our allowance for doubtful accounts, of $26,452. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, we had $17,252 available for additional use under our working capital loan with Simplify. As of March 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Simplify working capital loan was $7,748. Our cash balance as of the issuance date of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements is $4,151.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

Material Contractual Obligations

 

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business primarily consisting of employment contracts, consulting agreements, leases, liquidated damages, debt and related interest payments. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. See Notes 5, 8, 10, 11 and 12 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2024, related to leases, liquidated damages, working capital loan, bridge notes and debt, respectively. During 2022, we assumed the lease from Men’s Journal for office space in Carlsbad, California, that expires in March 2025, and we remain responsible for $1,439 over the lease term. The lease provides for fixed payments ranging from $89 to $94 over the remainder of the lease term, with an estimate of common expenses per month of $25 through the end of the lease term. There have been no material changes from the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Discontinued Operations

 

In connection with our discontinued operations from the discontinuance of the Sports Illustrated media business, we recorded the termination fee liability of $45,000 and recognized a loss on impairment of assets of $39,391 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As a result of this discontinuance, our total liabilities from the discontinued operations were $98,874, offset by our total assets from discontinued operations of $5,691 as of March 31, 2024.

 

Net loss from our discontinued operations, net of tax, was $90,638 and $4,853 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as indicated in the Results of Operations section below.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the net loss from continuing operations improved $1,804 to $12,720, as compared to our prior period of $14,524. This improvement was primarily due to a $3,153 decrease in operating expenses that was offset by a decrease in gross profit of $1,395. This improvement was offset by a loss from discontinued operations of $90,638 as compared to $4,853 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily driven by the accrual of the $45,000 termination fee liability and the recognition of a loss on impairment of assets of $39,391. This increased loss from discontinued operations lead to an increase in our net loss of $83,981 as compared to $19,377 from our prior period, resulting in a net loss of $103,358 for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 we had gross profit of $8,933, as compared to $10,328 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,395. Gross profit percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 30.9%, as compared to 36.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

The reduction in gross profit percentage was driven by a higher mix of revenue from sports partners, which receive a revenue share, resulting in Publisher Partner revenue share as a percentage of digital advertising revenue increasing to 27.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 22.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, total revenue increased $523, or 1.8%, to $28,941 from $28,418 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This reflected a decrease in print revenue of $1,489 due primarily to the shutdown of Athlon Outdoor print operations, which was largely offset by a 7.5% increase in digital revenue from $26,656 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $28,668 for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

The primary driver of the increase in our digital revenue is a 19.1% increase in our digital advertising revenue from $19,093 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $22,748 in the current year period. In addition, other digital revenue increased by $735 to $1,286 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 driven by the expansion in our e-commerce revenue. These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in our digital subscriptions of $1,327 and a $1,051 decline in licensing and syndication revenue.

Cost of revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by increases in technology, Platform and software licensing fees of $465 and Publisher Partner revenue share payments of $2,137 and content and editorial expenses of $2,453; partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation costs of $1,598.

                                                       Three Months Ended March 31,                    2024 versus 2023

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration of $313 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 represents the change in the put option on our common stock in connection with the Fexy Studios acquisition.

 

Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense of $4,339 and $4,182 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $157 from the prior period, as a result of our debt increase.

 

Liquidated Damages. We recorded $76 of accrued interest on our liquidated damages payable for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily from the issuance of our convertible debentures, Series H convertible preferred stock, Series I convertible preferred stock, Series J convertible preferred stock and Series K convertible preferred stock in prior years. We recorded $127 of accrued interest on our liquidated damages payable for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily from issuance of the same securities as described above.

 

                                                                   39



 

 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”); however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that are noncash in nature or not related to our core business operations. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss as adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, with additional adjustments for (i) interest expense (net), (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) change in valuation of contingent consideration; (vi) liquidated damages, (vii) loss on impairment of assets, (viii) employee retention credit, and (ix) employee restructuring payments.

 

Our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA:

 

     ●    does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;

     ●    does not reflect income tax provision or benefit, which is a noncash income or expense;

     ●    does not reflect depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a noncash expense, the assets being depreciated

           may have to be replaced in the future, increasing our cash

           requirements;

     ●    does not reflect stock-based compensation and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs;

     ●    does not reflect the change in valuation of contingent consideration, and, although this is a noncash income or expense, the

           change in the valuations each reporting period are not impacted by our actual business operations but is instead strongly

           tied to the change in the market value of our common

           stock;

     ●    does not reflect liquidated damages and, therefore, does not include future cash requirements if we repay the liquidated

           damages in cash instead of shares of our common stock (which the investor would need to agree

           to);

     ●    does not reflect any losses from the impairment of assets, which is a noncash operating expense;

     ●    does not reflect the employee retention credits recorded by us for payroll related tax credits under the CARES Act; and

     ●    does not reflect payments related to employee severance and employee restructuring changes for our former executives.

Employee restructuring payments (8)                                                                     2,456                  1,675 

Adjusted EBITDA                                                                          $               (848)  $             (2,103)

 

     (1)  Interest expense is related to our capital structure and varies over time due to a variety of financing transactions.

           Interest expense includes $536 and $930 for amortization of debt discounts for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and

           2023, respectively, as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, which are noncash items. Investors

           should note that interest expense will recur in future

           periods.

           

     (2)  Depreciation and amortization related to our developed technology and Platform is included within cost of revenues of $1,549

           and $2,369, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and depreciation and amortization is included

           within operating expenses of $987 and $1,096 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe

           (i) the amount of depreciation and amortization expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying

           performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new

           acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets. Investors should note that the use

           of tangible and intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue

           generation and should also note that such expense will recur in future

           periods.

           

     (3)  Stock-based compensation represents noncash costs arise from the grant of stock-based awards to employees, consultants and

           directors. We believe that excluding the effect of stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and

           investors in making period-to-period comparisons in our operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any

           specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations, and (ii) such expenses

           can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in

           connection with acquisitions. Additionally, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists

           management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between our operating performance and the operating performance of

           other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their

           stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose

           efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in

           future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the

           future.

           

     (4)  Change in fair value of contingent consideration represents the change in the put option on our common stock in connection

           with the Fexy Studios

           acquisition.

           

     (5)  Liquidated damages (or interest expense related to accrued liquidated damages) represents amounts we owe to certain of our

           investors in private placements offerings conducted in fiscal years 2018 through 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to

           certain covenants in the respective securities purchase agreements and registration rights agreements, including the filing

           of resale registration statements and becoming current in our reporting obligations, which we were not able to timely

           meet.

           

     (6)  Loss on impairment of assets represents certain assets that are no longer useful.

 

                                                                   41



 

 

     (7)  Employee retention credit represents payroll related tax credits under the Cares Act.

           

     (8)  Employee restructuring payments represents severance payments to employees under employer restructuring arrangements and

           payments to our former Chief Executive Officer for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,

           respectively.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions.

 

Except as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted as of the date of this report.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not applicable to a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of SEC Regulation S-K.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024 in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

 

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   42



 

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with SEC in connection with evaluating us, our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
