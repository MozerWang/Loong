Going concern

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and fulfillment of obligations in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and fulfillment of obligations in the normal course of business is dependent on, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and the Company’s ability to arrange adequate financing arrangements. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital of $277,204, including cash and cash equivalents of $16,785, and accumulated deficit and statutory reserves of $9,550,550. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred net loss of $1,001,080 and had net cash outflows of $290,166 from operating activities.

 

The Company requires additional capital within the next six months to fund the continued operations of the Company. In order to support the Company’s operations, the Company plans to take actions to increase revenues and cash inflows by promoting product sales, expanding customer base and making additional efforts in accounts receivable collections, in addition to seeking bank borrowings and fundings from shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, the business operations and prospects of the Company may suffer.

 

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting estimates include certain assumptions related to going concern, allowance of credit losses, allowance of deferred tax asset and uncertain tax position, implicit interest rate of operating leases, useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets, and impairment of goodwill. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

Foreign currency translation and re-measurement

 

The Company translates its foreign operations to the U.S. dollar in accordance with ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”.

 

The reporting currency for the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The Company, DIGLS, DILHK, JJGS and JJHK’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; QHDX, JJSZ and their subsidiaries which are incorporated in PRC use the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) as their functional currency.

 

The Company’s subsidiaries, whose records are not maintained in that company’s functional currency, re-measure their records into their functional currency as follows:

 

     ●    Monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period

     ●    Nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates

     ●    Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period

 

Gains and losses from these re-measurements were not significant and have been included in the Company’s results of operations.

 

                                                                   9



 

 

The Company’s subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, translate their records into the U.S. dollar as follows:

 

     ●    Assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date

     ●    Equities at the historical rate

     ●    Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period

 

Translation of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at the rates used in translation.

 

Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill

 

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Impairment may be the result of becoming obsolete from a change in the industry or new technologies. Impairment is present if the carrying amount of an asset is less than its undiscounted cash flows to be generated.

 

If an asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

 

The Company did not recognize any impairment of long-lived assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Goodwill

 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Others”, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist, applying a fair-value based test. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record any impairment of goodwill.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

Revenue recognition

 

The Company follows the guidance of ASC 606, revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:

 

     1.   Identify the contract(s) with a customer;

     2.   Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

     3.   Determine the transaction price;

     4.   Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

     5.   Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

 

Under Topic 606, revenues are recognized when the promised products have been confirmed of delivery or services have been transferred to the consumers in amounts that reflect the consideration the customer expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company presents value added taxes (“VAT”) as reductions of revenues. The Company recognizes revenues net of value added taxes (“VAT”) and relevant charges.

 

We generate revenue primarily from the sales of liquor, water, water purifier and other products directly to agents, wholesalers and end users, with majority of sales transactions were conducted offline. We recognize product revenue at a point in time when the control of the products has been transferred to customers. The transfer of control is considered complete when products have been picked up by or delivered to our customers. We account for shipping and handling fees as a fulfillment cost.

Contract liabilities

 

Contract liabilities consist mainly of customer advances. On certain occasions, the Company may receive prepayments from downstream retailers or wholesales customers for liquors, water and other products prior to them taking possession of the Company’s products. The Company records these receipts as customer advances until the control of the products has been transferred the customers. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had customer advances of $1,350,606 and $1,364,260, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $39,076 of customer advances in the opening balance.

 

Related party transaction

 

Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.

 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 was further amended in November 2020 by ASU No. 2020-10, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). As a result, ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. This ASU is expected to improve comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-08 on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Net Revenues

 

Net revenues were $267,822 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $1,367,467, or 84%, from $1,635,289 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net revenues was mainly due to the lower product sales volume than the same period of the prior year and to a lesser extent, the lower unit sales prices of wine products. The decrease in product sales was resulted from a decline in market demand resulting from the sluggish economic environment and slow recovery in China’s economy as compared to the same period of the prior year. And in order to attract new customers, the Company has lowered the unit sales prices of wine products beginning in April 2023.

 

                                                                   21



 

 

Cost of Revenues

The decrease in cost of revenues was mainly due to the lower product sales volume in line with our net revenues decrease and to a lesser extent, the lower unit sales prices of wine products, which led to a lesser decrease in cost of revenues comparing to net revenues.

 

Gross Profit

 

Gross profit was $54,933 and $957,922 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $902,989, or 94%. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to the decrease in the net revenues.

 

Operating Expenses

 

Operating expenses were $1,047,874 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $83,237, or 9%, from $964,637 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to the allowance of credit loss for accounts receivable.

 

Net Loss

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net loss was $1,001,080, compared to the net loss of $89,176 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loss was a result of the factors described above.

                                                            March 31, 2024           December 31, 2023              Change          

Total current assets                                    $            4,098,040   $            5,083,189   $             (985,149)

Total current liabilities                                            3,820,836                3,851,925                  (31,089)

Working capital                                         $              277,204   $            1,231,264   $             (954,060)

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had working capital of $277,204, as compared to working capital of $1,231,264 as of December 31, 2023. We had total current assets of $4,098,040, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $16,785, inventories of $25,146, prepayments and other current assets of $1,527,126, accounts receivable of $2,528,983 compared to total current assets of $5,083,189 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in total current assets was mainly due to the decrease in accounts receivable, prepayments and other current assets, and cash and cash equivalents. We had current liabilities of $3,820,836, consisting of operating lease obligations - current of $99,017, accounts payable of $495,227, accrued liabilities of $671,722, bank and other borrowing - current of $424,604, customer advances of $1,350,606 and due to related parties of $779,660. The decrease in total current liabilities was mainly due to the decrease in the accounts payable and customer advances.

 

                                                                   22



 

 

Our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to $16,785 as of March 31, 2024, from $288,255 as of December 31, 2023. We estimate the Company currently has insufficient working capital to support its daily operations for the next twelve months, without raising additional capital. The Company is continuing to look for different financing opportunities in order to increase working capital and improve liquidity, including bank borrowings and additional fundings from major shareholders. We intend to commence new promotion plans to increase product sales and expand customer base and make additional efforts in accounts receivable collections. If we are unable to generate sufficient profits from operations or obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, there could be substantial uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

 

No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its shareholders, in the case of equity financing.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of March 31, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weakness under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and review related party transactions.

 

                                                                   24



 

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors (the “Board”), management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ●    Apply to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of the assets of the

           company;

           

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with

           authorizations of management and directors of the company;

           and

           

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

           company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

 

We carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2024. Management based the assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:

 

     ●    We have increased our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function and intend to

           hire one or more additional personnel for the function due to

           turnover.

           

     ●    We plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies at the end of 2024.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   25
