CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

 

When used in this Quarterly Report, including the documents that we have incorporated by reference, in future filings with the SEC or in press releases or other written or oral communications, statements which are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “continue,” “intend,” “should,” “may” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters, are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Discussions containing forward-looking statements may be found in the material set forth under “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in other sections of this Quarterly Report.

 

Forward-looking statements are necessarily subjective, are based upon our current plans, intentions, objectives, goals, strategies, beliefs, projections and expectations, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors.

 

Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether, or the times by which, our performance or results may be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and management’s belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report may turn out to be inaccurate. Important factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report. All forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

The Company has funded its operations primarily through sales of its common stock in public markets, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, and the sale of convertible notes. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the (i) rate of revenue growth, (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities, (iii) timing and extent of spending on content development efforts, and (iv) market acceptance of the Company’s content, products and services.

 

The Company’s management intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt to enable the Company to meet its obligations for the twelve-month period. However, there can be no assurance that, in the event the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of this report.

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 

 

3.                SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in conjunction with the instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its operating subsidiaries GSOC, TDH, GEDU, GNUT, and CIM. The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to its less-than-wholly-owned subsidiary, CIM, as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity’s equity. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is included in net loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

These condensed consolidated financial statements include all of the adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments, which include intercompany balances and transactions are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto at December 31, 2023, as presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 16, 2024 with the SEC.

 

Certain amounts for the prior year period have been reclassified to conform to current period’s presentation.

 

 

 

                                                                   10                                                                   

 

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, valuation of accounts receivable, goodwill and other long-lived assets, and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known or expected trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information available as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

 

Update to Significant Accounting Policies

 

There have been no new or material changes to the significant accounting policies discussed in the Company’s audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company.

5.                INVENTORY 

 

Inventory primarily consists of costs incurred to produce animated content for third party customers. Costs incurred to produce the animated content for customers, which include direct production costs, production overhead and supplies are recognized as work-in-progress inventory. As animated content is completed in accordance with the terms stated by the customer, inventory is classified as finished products and subsequently recognized as cost of services as animated content is accepted by and available to the customer. Carrying amounts of animated content are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for direct production costs, productions overhead and supplies used for completing animation projects.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s inventory totaled $44,771 and $43,205, respectively, and was comprised of work-in-progress of $39,218 and $40,722, and finished goods of $5,553 and $2,483, respectively.

 

 

6.                LEASES

 

The Company has entered into operating leases primarily for office space. These leases have original terms which range from two years to six years, and often include one or more options to renew or in the case of equipment rental, to purchase the equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not record any additional right of use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities related to new operating leases.

 

The future minimum payment obligations at March 31, 2024 for operating leases are as follows: 

Schedule of future minimum payment obligations

These operating leases are listed as separate line items on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligation to make lease payments are also listed as separate line items on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 

Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.

8.                GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 

Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill arising from the Company’s acquisitions is attributable to the value of the potential expanded market opportunity with new customers.

Capitalized Prepublication Costs

 

Prepublication costs include costs incurred to create and develop the art, prepress, editorial, digital conversion and other content required for the creation of the master copy of a book or other media. Prepublication costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a two- to five-year period based on expected future revenue. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of the capitalized costs based on expected future revenues.

 

Capitalized Produced and Licensed Content Costs

 

Produced and licensed content costs include capitalizable direct costs, production overhead, interest and development costs and are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value. Marketing, distribution and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.

 

Film, television and direct to consumers through streaming services production and residual costs are expensed over the product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. For film productions and direct to consumer services, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Costs of film, television and direct to consumer productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The Company bases these fair value measurements on the Company’s assumptions about how market participants would price the assets at the balance sheet date, which may be different than the amounts ultimately realized in future periods. The amount by which the unamortized costs of film and television productions exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Costs for projects that have been abandoned are written off. Projects that have not been set for production within three years are also written off unless management has committed to a plan to proceed with the project and is actively working on and funding the project.

Capitalized Website Development Costs

 

The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development of its Santa.com website after the preliminary project stage is complete and until the website is ready for its intended use. Planning and operating costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, project plan is defined, functionalities are determined and internal and external resources are identified. Qualified costs incurred during the operating stage of our software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will result in added functionality, while costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to the websites are expensed as incurred.

  

Capitalized website costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three years beginning with the time when it is ready for intended use. Amounts amortized are presented through cost of sales. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

In connection with the purchase and sale of the notes, the Company agreed to issue to Alpha warrants to acquire a total of 3,028,146 shares of the Company’s common stock. The warrant to be issued at the first closing shall be a warrant for 1,514,073 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.78 per share. The warrant to be issued at the second closing shall be a warrant for 1,514,073 shares of the Company’s common Stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share.

 

On November 20, 2023, the Company entered into a first amendment agreement (the “Amendment”) to the Alpha SPA. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Alpha SPA was amended by replacing the first closing warrant for 1,514,073 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.78 per share with (i) a warrant for 757,036 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.78 per share and (ii) a warrant for 757,036 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $.001 per share. Additionally, the Amendment replaced the second closing warrant for 1,514,073 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.001 per share with (i) a warrant for 757,036 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.78 per share and (ii) a warrant for 757,036 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $.001 per share.

On December 21, 2023, the Company received approximately $3.6 million in gross proceeds from the first closing, prior to deducting the underwriting discount and commission and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

 

On March 11, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to the Alpha SPA pursuant to which (1) the exercise price of each of the Warrant A and the Warrant C (as described in the Alpha SPA) has been amended from $1.78 per share of common stock to $0.001 per share, and (2) the Company shall promptly effect a reverse stock split in the event that the closing price of its common stock falls below $0.25 per share for a period of five consecutive trading days.

 

In connection with the Second Amendment, the Company also entered into an amendment (the “First Note Amendment”) to the Convertible Promissory Note originally dated November 9, 2023 (together with the First Note Amendment, the “Note”) with the Investor, pursuant to which Section 1.1(a) of the Note was amended to add that in no event shall the Conversion Price (as defined in the Note) be less than $0.25.

 

At March 31, 2024, the principal balance of these notes was $60,322 and the remaining balance on the associated loan discounts was $50,834.

14.   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES

 

On December 21, 2023, the Company sold a note to Generating Alpha Ltd. in the aggregate principal amount of $4,000,000 with a five-year maturity, interest at 9% per calendar year, and carries a 9% original issue discount (the “First Alpha Note”). The First Alpha Note is convertible at the discretion of Alpha into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.50. Alpha may choose the alternate conversion price equal to 85% of the average of the three lowest trading prices during the previous ten trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to notice of conversion.

 

The Company assessed the alternate conversion price and determined that it represented a derivative liability with a fair value of $1,310,394 at December 31, 2023.

 

 

 

                                                                   20                                                                   

 

 

On March 11, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the First Alpha Note originally dated November 9, 2023 with the investor, pursuant to which the Note was amended to add that in no event shall the conversion price be less than $0.25. The addition of a floor price to the alternative conversion price settled the derivative liability as it eliminated the uncertainty surrounding the issuance of an indeterminable number of shares under the terms of the First Alpha Note.

 

The fair values of derivative liability were calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation with the following factors, assumptions and methodologies:

The derivative was re-measured at each conversion date and at the date of the amendment on March 11, 2024, resulting in the reclassification of the $175,814 derivative liability to additional paid-in capital.

 

 

15.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

 

Fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid upon the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, non on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, include the Company’s own credit risk.

 

The Company applied FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 – Fair Value Measurement, which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing the framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 applies to financial and nonfinancial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:

 

  · Level 1 – Unadjusted inputs based on quoted markets for identical assets or liabilities.

     

  · Level 2 – Observable inputs, either direct or indirect, not including Level 1 measurements, corroborated by market data or based

     upon quoted prices in non-active

     markets

     

  · Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best assumptions of what market participants would use in valuing the

     asset or

     liability.

 

Contingent Consideration

 

The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration payable was based on the Company’s evaluation as to the probability and amount of any earn-out that could have ultimately been payable. The Company utilizes a third-party valuation firm to assist in the calculation of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date. The Company evaluates the forecast of the acquired entity and the probability of earn-out provisions being achieved when it evaluates the contingent consideration recorded at initial acquisition date and at each subsequent reporting period. The fair value of contingent consideration is measured at each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The Company evaluates the terms in contingent consideration arrangements provided to former owners of acquired companies who become employees of the Company to determine if such amounts are part of the purchase price of the acquired entity or compensation. Because the fair value measurements relating to the contingent consideration liabilities are subject to management judgment, measurement uncertainty is inherent in the valuation of the contingent consideration liabilities as of the reporting date.

 

 

 

                                                                   21                                                                   

 

 

Derivative Liabilities

 

The fair value of the derivative liabilities is classified as Level 3 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy. Please refer to Note 14 (“Derivative Liability”), for a further discussion of the measurement of fair value of the derivatives and their underlying assumptions.

 

The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments carried at fair value at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:

16.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

  

The Company’s subsidiary, TDAM, has an unfunded, non-contributory defined benefit plan covering its permanent employees.

 

Under the existing regulatory framework, the Company is required to pay eligible employees at least the minimum regulatory benefit upon retirement, which provides a retirement benefit equal to 22.5 days’ pay for every year of credited service, subject to age and service requirements. The regulatory benefit is paid in a lump sum upon retirement. The existing regulatory framework does not require minimum funding of the plan.

 

Retirement benefit expenses and liabilities are determined in accordance with an actuarial study made for the plan utilizing the net interest approach which disaggregates the defined benefit cost into the following components: service costs (cost of services received); net interest (financing effect of paying for benefits in advance or in arrears); and remeasurements (period-to-period fluctuations in the amounts of defined benefit obligations and plan assets).

 

Under the net interest approach, service cost and net interest on the defined benefit liability (asset) are both recognized in the statement of operations, while remeasurements of the defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income. Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified to profit or loss in a subsequent period.

 

The amount of the defined benefit liability reported under other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is determined as follows:

17.               INCOME TAXES

 

In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon currently known facts and circumstances and applies that rate to its year-to-date earnings or losses. The Company’s effective tax rate is based on expected income and statutory tax rates and takes into consideration permanent differences between financial statement and tax return income applicable to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effect of discrete items, such as changes in estimates, changes in rates or tax status, and unusual or infrequently occurring events, is recognized in the interim period in which the discrete item occurs. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or as the result of new judicial interpretations or regulatory or tax law changes.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state NOL's may be subject to limitation under IRS Sec. 382, the analysis of which is not yet complete. The Company has established a full valuation allowance against the US federal, state and foreign NOL carryforwards as well as its other US and foreign deferred tax assets based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future years.

 

The Company’s interim effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete items, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 0%, respectively, due to recurrent net losses for the periods presented.

Recent Developments

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On June 23, 2023, our Board and shareholders approved the granting of authority to the Board to amend our articles of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, by a ratio of no less than 1-for-2 and no more than 1-for-20, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Board in its sole discretion, and with such reverse stock split to be effective at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. On September 7, 2023, our Board effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split in connection with the continued listing of our common stock on Nasdaq.

 

The reverse stock split did not have any impact on the number of authorized shares of common stock, which remains at 500,000,000 shares.

 

November 2023 SPA for Convertible Promissory Note and Warrants with Generating Alpha and Amendments

 

On November 9, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended on November 20, 2023 and March 11, 2024, the “November 2023 SPA”) with Generating Alpha Ltd. (“Generating Alpha”) pursuant to which we have agreed to sell two convertible promissory notes, with each note having an initial principal amount of $4,000,000, for a price of $3,640,000 per note.

The purchase price of the December 2023 Note was $3,640,000. The aggregate gross proceeds of the December 2023 Offering were approximately $3.6 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other expenses payable by us.

 

In connection with the November 2023 SPA, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated December 21, 2023 (the “December 2023 Registration Rights Agreement”), with Generating Alpha. The December 2023 Registration Rights Agreement provided that we shall file a registration statement covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the December 2023 Registration Rights Agreement) with the SEC.

 

On March 11, 2024, we entered into a second amendment agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to the November 2023 SPA with Generating Alpha, pursuant to which (1) the exercise price of each of the Warrant A and the Warrant C (as described in the November 2023 SPA) has been amended from $1.78 per share of common stock to $0.001 per share, and (2) we shall promptly effect a reverse stock split in the event that the closing price of our common stock falls below $0.25 per share for a period of five consecutive trading days.

Notice of Delisting of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard

 

On February 29, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Letter”) from the Staff indicating that unless we request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) by March 7, 2024, our securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market based upon our non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Letter specified that we are not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)), as the bid price for our listed securities closed at less than $1 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), as we previously implemented two reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one, we are not eligible for any compliance period specified in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A).

 

On March 6, 2024, we requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the determination made by the Staff, and Nasdaq has scheduled the hearing for May 2, 2024. Accordingly, the suspension of our securities has been stayed, pending the Panel’s decision.

 

On April 15, 2023 we received a letter from the Panel that based on our written appeal, Nasdaq has granted an extension until August 27, 2024 provided that we effect a reverse stock split no later than August 13, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.

 

Non-Binding Letter of Intent with Arctic7

 

On March 5, 2024, we signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Arctic7, Inc. (“Arctic7”), an emerging gaming industry service provider, through issuance of shares of our common stock. Arctic7 is currently engaged in the business of providing full game development, co-development, transmedia and virtual production services to its customers and partners.

 

March 2024 SPA for Equity Line of Credit with Generating Alpha

 

On March 11, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “March 2024 SPA”) with Generating Alpha pursuant to which we have agreed to issue and sell to Generating Alpha from time to time up to $25 million of common stock.

 

Pursuant to the March 2024 SPA, we may require Generating Alpha to purchase shares of common stock by delivering put notices to Generating Alpha, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, at a purchase price of 85% of the lowest traded price of our common stock during the 10 trading days immediately preceding the date 10 business days after the date the put shares have been accepted and cleared by Generating Alpha’s brokerage firm. We have agreed to issue to Generating Alpha as a commitment fee a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the “Warrant”) for 2,314,814 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.001 per share.

 

In connection with the March 2024 SPA, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “March 2024 Registration Rights Agreement”) with Generating Alpha, pursuant to which we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC on a date no later than sixty (60) days following the date thereof and to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within thirty (30) calendar days, but no more than ninety (90) calendar days, after we have filed the Registration Statement.

 

On April 24, 2024, we entered into an omnibus amendment agreement with Generating Alpha pursuant to which (1) the March 2024 SPA was amended to clarify that the calculation of the number of put shares issuable by us without any shareholder approval required by an exchange shall include all shares of common stock beneficially owned by Generating Alpha, and (2) the March 2024 Warrant was amended to remove its alternative cashless exercise feature.

Animation revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $761,505, compared to animation revenue of $1,057,669 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, representing a decrease of $296,194 or 28.0%. The decrease in animation revenue is primarily attributable to a smaller number of animation projects currently in production as compared to the prior year period.

 

Original content revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $45,064, compared to original content revenue of $50,863 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $5,799 or 11.4%. The decrease in original content revenue is attributable to the reduction in sales of our published products in comparison to the prior year period.

 

Social and technology revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $67,663, compared to social and technology revenue of $91,111 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $23,448 or 25.7%. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales and the timing or loss of multi-year contract renewals from our web filtering solutions.

 

Gross Profit

 

Our gross profits vary significantly by subsidiary. In recent years, our animation business has realized gross profits between 25% and 35%, while our web filtering business has realized gross profits between 90% and 95%. Our gross profits may vary from period to period due to the nature of the business of each segment, and the timing and volume of customer contracts and projects. Current gross profit percentages may not be indicative of future gross profit performance.

 

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $262,337, or 30.0%, and $540,137, or 45.0%, respectively. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to lower animation revenue levels.

Operating Expenses

 

Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2,023,354, compared to operating expenses of $2,305,470 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $282,116 or 12.2%. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as described below.

 

Depreciation and amortization included in operating expenses was $142,634 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $153,190 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $10,556 or 6.9%. These costs are comprised of the depreciation of property and equipment, the amortization of intangible assets, and the amortization of capitalized costs from the development of our Santa.com ecommerce website and prepublication costs from our graphic novels and other published content.

 

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) are comprised of selling, marketing and promotional expenses, compensation and benefits, insurance, investor relations, rent and related facility costs, research and development, and other general expenses. SG&A expenses were $1,535,844 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1,875,360 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $339,516 or 18.1%. The increase is largely attributable to reduced employment and benefit costs from a decrease in headcount realized during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Professional fees are comprised of accounting and compliance services, legal services, and certain other advisory and consultancy fees. Professional fees were $344,876 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $276,920 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $67,956 or 24.5%. The increase is largely attributable to an increase in professional services utilized by TDH for various matters during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Other Income (Expense)

 

Net other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2,301,670, compared to a net other expense of $464,992 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $1,836,678 or 395.0%. The increase in other expense is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense from the amortization and write off of debt discounts on convertible promissory notes due to conversions. The increase was offset in part by an unrealized gain on the change in fair value of $1,310,394 related to the convertible feature of the promissory notes.

 

Interest expense is comprised of interest accrued and paid on our convertible notes and recorded from the amortization of note discounts. Interest expense was $3,413,520 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $480,778 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $2,932,742 or 610.0%. As noted above, the increase in interest expense is attributable to an increase in the amortization and write off of debt discounts on convertible promissory notes due to conversions In January 2023, we recognized $350,039 in interest expense for the warrants issued to L1 Capital in exchange for a waiver of certain financing covenants and provisions.

 

Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders

 

We realized a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4,146,202, or $1.47 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2,329,931, or $8.55 per share, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1,816,271 or 78.0%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $452,454.

 

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2,245,591, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2,172,556 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase in net cash used of $73,035, primarily due to the change in our operating assets and liabilities and the reduction in our loss from operations.

 

Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $3,741, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $10,505 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 representing a decrease in cash used of $6,764. This change is attributable to a decrease in the amount of our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $204,827, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2,420,579 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease in cash provided of $2,215,752. Our primary sources of cash from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were attributable to $250,000 in loan proceeds received from accredited investors, as compared to $2,460,668 in proceeds from the sale of our common stock and exercise of common stock purchase warrants during the prior year period. These proceeds were offset, in part, by the repayment of convertible notes and loans payable of $45,173 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to repayments of convertible notes and loans for $40,089 during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

  

Going Concern

 

On a consolidated basis, we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As of March 31, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of $100.9 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we used approximately $2.2 million in cash for operating activities.

 

We have funded our operations primarily through sales of our common stock in public markets, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, and sales of convertible notes. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the (i) rate of revenue growth, (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities, (iii) timing and extent of spending on content development efforts, and (iv) market acceptance of our content, products and services.

 

Our management intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt to enable us to meet our obligations for the twelve-month period. However, there can be no assurance that, in the event we require additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

 

 

                                                                   38                                                                   

 

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position.

 

In the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide this information.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of March 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.

 

These controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial, as appropriate officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

The Company’s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below:

 

Functional Controls and Segregation of Duties

 

Because of the Company’s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. Additionally, there is inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we will need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties.

 

Accordingly, as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.

 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size. Management continues to take actions to remedy these weaknesses, including the process of hiring additional staff to create the necessary segregation of duties to improve controls over information processing. Additionally, management has initiated the process of building a risk management framework with plans to embed the principles of this framework across all aspects of the business.

Remediation Plan

 

Management has implemented remediation steps to address the material weakness and to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we (i) expanded and improved our review process for complex transactions and related accounting standards, including the identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding the application of complex accounting matters, (ii) hired qualified personnel to improve the oversight of our accounting operations, and (iii) established new processes and policies. While we believe that these remediation actions will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the material weakness identified will not be considered remediated until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Other than as described above in our remediation plan, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our first fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
