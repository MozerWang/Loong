Cuentas, Inc. (the “Company”) together with its subsidiaries, is mainly focused on financial technology (“FINTECH”) services, delivering mobile financial services, prepaid debit and digital content services to unbanked, underbanked and underserved communities. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company initiated its first investment into the Real Estate market and, made its second, more significant investment in Real Estate in the second quarter of 2023. The Company derived its revenue from wholesale telecommunication services, GPR “Debit” Card fees and the sales of prepaid products and services including third party digital content, gift cards, remittances, mobile phone topups and other digital services.   Additionally, the Company has an agreement with Interactive Communications International, Inc. (“InComm”) a leading processor of general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) debit cards, to market and distribute a line of prepaid digital content and gift cards targeted towards the Latin American market. Cuentas is able to purchase InComm’s prepaid digital content and gift cards at a discount and resell these same products in real time through its mobile app and through the Cuentas SDI network of over 31,000 bodegas.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on September 21, 2005. Its subsidiary, Meimoun and Mammon, LLC (100% owned) (“M&M”), Tel3, a business segment of the Company, provides prepaid calling cards to consumers directly and operates in a complimentary space as Meimoun and Mammon, LLC. The Company invested $46, of which $20 were invested during 2023, for 50% of CUENTASMAX LLC which installs WiFi6 shared network (“WSN”) systems in locations in the New York metropolitan tristate area using access points and small cells to provide users with access to the WSN.
 
NASDAQ
 
On August 18, 2023, the Company received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq Regulation stating that based upon its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2023 which reported shareholders’ equity of $1,471, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(b)(1) which requires the Company to maintain shareholders’ equity of not less than $2,500 for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
 
On October 3 2023, the Company received a Staff Determination Letter from Nasdaq Regulation stating that due to the Company’s failure by October 2, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), the $2,500 stockholders’ equity requirement, the Company would be subject to delisting unless it timely requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).

GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $28 in cash and cash equivalents, $3,249 in negative working capital, shareholder’s deficit of $395 and an accumulated deficit of $55,391. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions and revenue from operations. Management anticipates their business will require substantial additional investments that have not yet been secured. Management is continuing in the process of fund raising in the private equity and capital markets as the Company will need to finance future activities. The Company, through M&M is negotiating to sell mobile services as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) through an operator on the largest 5G nationwide network and plans to offer low-cost mobile phone service with the ability to make international calls to specific Spanish speaking countries in Central and South America. In addition, as noted in note 3, on March 13, 2024, the Company approved the signing of a letter of intent to sell the “Brooksville Property” for gross proceeds of $7,200 (see note 3 for further information). These financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
Basis of presentation 
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the financial statements presented herein have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm but include all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the for three-months ended March 31, 2024. However, these results are not necessarily indicative of results for any other interim period or for the year ended December 31, 2024. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions for the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.
 
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continue)
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the Company and its wholly- owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, certain revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Fair Value Measurement
 
Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
 
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
 
Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
 
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
 
Our financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payables, and other accrued liabilities. The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value as a result of the short duration of such instruments or due to the variability of the interest cost associated with such instruments.
  
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company was not required to adopt any recently issued accounting standards.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to provide enhanced segment disclosures. The standard will require disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and identifying the Chief Operating Decision Maker and how they use the reported segment profitability measures to assess segment performance and allocate resources. These enhanced disclosures are required for all entities on an interim and annual basis, even if they have only a single reportable segment. The standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to provide enhancements to annual income tax disclosures. The standard will require more detailed information in the rate reconciliation table and for income taxes paid, among other enhancements. The standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2024, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 – EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD
 
          A.   On February 7, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement with 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC, an accredited investor,
                pursuant to which the Company sold the investor an unsecured original issuance discount promissory note in the
                principal amount of $178,250 (the “February Promissory Note”). The Company received net proceeds of $150,000 in
                consideration of issuance of the February Promissory Note after original issue discount of $23,250 and legal fees of
                $5,000. The aggregate debt discount of $28,250 is being amortized to interest expense over the respective term of the
                note. The February Promissory Note shall incur a one-time interest charge of 12%, which is added to the principal
                balance, has a maturity date of November 15, 2024, and requires monthly payments of $22,182 beginning on March 15,
                2024. The February Promissory Note is convertible into common shares of the Company at any time following an event of
                default at a rate of 65% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock during the ten prior trading days.
                In addition, upon default, the Company must repay an amount equal to 150% of the then outstanding amount of principal
                and accrued interest combined. As of March 31, 2024, the balance of the note is $137,529, with a remaining unamortized
                discount of
                $22,941.
 
          B.   On March 13, 2024, the Company through its 63% participation in Brooksville Development Partners, LLC approved the
                signing of a Letter of Intent to sell the “Brooksville Property” located at 19200 Cortez Boulevard, Brooksville,
                Florida
                34601.
 
The property was originally purchased on April 28, 2023 for $5,050. The $3,050 mortgage with Republic Bank of Chicago was amended and restated on January 27, 2024 for $3,055. Additionally, a $500 Loan Extension Agreement was executed between the Company and ALF Trust u/a/d 09/28/2023 to ensure the Promissory Note necessary to fund the interest reserve and fees relating to the Loan Extension Agreement and the working capital needs of the Company. On April 3, 2024 the Company entered into a provisional agreement to sell the “Brooksville Property” for a total consideration of $7,200 whereby the buyer placed a non-refundable $100k deposit in escrow and has 60 days to decide whether to complete the transaction.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on September 21, 2005 to act as an operational company and as a holding company for its subsidiaries. Its subsidiaries are Meimoun and Mammon, LLC (100% owned) (“M&M”) which provides wholesale and retail telecommunications services, Tel3, a division of M&M, is a retail long distance calling platform which provides prepaid calling services to consumers directly and operates in a complimentary space as M&M. The Company also own 50% of CUENTASMAX LLC, which installs WiFi6 shared network (“WSN”) systems in locations in the New York metropolitan tristate area using access points and small cells to provide users with access to the WSN.
 
The Company is focusing its business mainly on using proprietary technologies to integrate FinTech (Financial Technology), e-finance and e-commerce services into solutions that deliver mobile financial services, prepaid debit and digital content services to the unbanked, under-banked and underserved populations nationally in the USA. The Cuentas technology platform integrates Cuentas Mobile, the Company’s Telecommunications solution, with its core financial services offerings to help entire communities enter the modern financial marketplace. Our General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) “Debit Card” is designed to allow customers to purchase prepaid products and services, including third party digital content, gift cards, remittances, mobile phone topups and other digital services. An agreement with Interactive Communications International, Inc. (“InComm”) a leading processor of general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) debit cards, enables us to market and distribute a line of prepaid digital content and gift cards targeted towards the Latin American market. Cuentas is able to purchase InComm’s prepaid digital content and gift cards at a discount and resell these same products in real time through its mobile app and through the Cuentas SDI network of over 31,000 bodegas. Cuentas is able to offer these digital products to the public through its mobile app and the Cuentas SDI distribution network, many at discounted prices, while making a small profit margin which varies from product to product. The prepaid digital content and gift cards include Amazon Cash, XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Karma Koin, Transit System Loads & Reloads (LA TAP, NY Transit, Grand Rapids, CT GO), Burger King, Cabela’s, Bass Pro Shops, AT&T, Verizon, Mango Mobile, Black Wireless and other prepaid wireless carriers in the United States.

Since the first quarter of 2023, we have made two equity investments in real estate projects in Florida under the name Cuentas Casa. Cuentas Casa partners with leading edge developers and construction technology companies to create sustainable, inclusive and affordable residential communities specifically designed to provide high quality housing alternatives at extremely competitive pricing. Our goal is to source land zoned and ready for development of multi-family buildings in strategic areas where rental prices are increasing dramatically, placing financial stress and pressure on working class families. Our real estate investments are intended to broaden our reach into the unbanked, underbanked and underserved communities by using a patented, low cost, sustainable technology that should allow us to provide reasonably priced rental apartments to working class residents who have been priced out of rental communities due to severe rent hikes in Florida and other areas in the United States. We believe that providing affordable apartments to the Hispanic Latino and other immigrant communities in Florida will enable us to introduce them our fintech solutions and generate revenue. Due to liquidity issues impeding the operation and development of its core mobile fintech and carrier services, on April 3, 2024, the limited liability company in which Cuentas has a 63.9% equity interest (“Brooksville Development Partners, LLC” or “BDP”), entered into an agreement to sell the vacant land located in Brooksville, Florida (the “Brooksville Property”) for a purchase price of $7.2 million. The Brooksville Property was originally purchased by BDP on April 28, 2023 for $5.05 million, $2 million of which was contributed by Cuentas. Cuentas will use its pro rata portion of the net proceeds of the sale, estimated between $1.625 million and $1.9 million, as working capital and for other opportunities that may become available.
 
Efforts to Upgrade our Technology Platforms and Increase Sales of our Fintech Products and Services Through Cuentas-SDI and Introduction of New Fintech Solutions
 
In April 2023, CIMA Telecom, which provided maintenance and support services for our fintech mobile app technology platform, shut down access to the platform as we were transitioning to a new, improved platform. The Cuentas prepaid Mastercard platform has continued to be active and the associated prepaid fintech platform behind it has continued to function properly. Cuentas is working to integrate the fintech mobile app software with an industry-proven platform and expects to make an announcement in 2024-Q2 related to this development.
 
During the first quarter of 2023, we reduced product availability to Cuentas-SDI to allow Cuentas-SDI to catch up on its payments and during the second quarter of 2023 we curtailed all services to Cuentas-SDI and marketing initiatives with Cuentas-SDI due to its inability to reduce its debt significantly. These disruptions to our fintech solutions and technology business were a major reason for the decline in revenue between the Q1-Q2 periods in 2022 and 2023.
  
In May 2023, The OLB Group (NASDAQ: OLB) (“OLB”) terminated a Software Licensing and Transaction Sharing Agreement with the Company for the purpose of upgrading the Cuentas Mobile App and digital distribution system. In June 2023, OLB acquired 80.01% of Cuentas-SDI. In July 2023, the Company and Cuentas-SDI settled certain payment issues and have re-opened the digital distribution network and systems through Cuentas-SDI’s convenience store distribution network of over 31,000 locations, including many across the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut tri-state area.
 
A major factor that provides technical strength and reliability to Cuentas’ project is the fintech ecosystem that it had developed. The foundation of Cuentas’ ecosystem is the software developed for the fintech platform with mobile app, mobile wallet and associated integrations that Cuentas had developed, designed & implemented over the past 3 years. We believe that the upgraded, retooled & reengineered platform will prove to be a robust, reliable transactional, marketing, financial and predictive, Tier-1 transactional platform. Cuentas’ ecosystem currently integrates its prepaid platform via dedicated APIs with Sutton Bank (the issuing bank), IDology (AML & KYC) and InComm (Processor, Load Network & 3rd Party Digital Products). During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment test for the impairment of those intangible assets. Based on the Company’s qualitative analysis, which considered the electronic products and General Purpose Reloadable Cards reporting unit results and additional business and industry specific considerations including the impact of the settlement agreement with CIMA Telecom, the Company performed a further revisions of the fair value of the acquired platforms. As a result of the factors discussed the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million whereas no amount was assigned to the acquired platforms on December 31, 2022.

Cuentas has agreed with Sutton Bank to wind down its relationship during 2024 and transition to a different US bank for issuance of its Prepaid Financial products. Cuentas is in the final stages of negotiation to determine the best banking partner for its future in the prepaid fintech marketplace. On May 16, 2024, the Company received a Notice of Termination of Contract from Sutton Bank. Management has been evaluating other alternatives including replacing issuing bank and other enhanced FinTech enabled solutions.
 
Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard account holders may deposit funds to their account via (a) no-cost Direct Deposit, or (b) for a small charge, using InComm’s VanillaLoad network in over 200,000 locations at major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Dollar General, and more.
 
Once account holders have available funds, they can use their Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® wherever prepaid Mastercards are accepted worldwide and at most ATMs in the U.S., and many international ATMs.
 
Cuentas e-commerce Distribution and Mobile Payments
 
The Cuentas e-commerce Distribution and Mobile Payments ecosystem will allow consumers to purchase Cuentas’s line of digital products and services through a nationwide network of retailers that specifically serve Cuentas’ target market. Cuentas’ distribution network includes certain neighborhood markets known as “Bodegas” and convenience stores as well as other retail establishments. This brings previously unavailable digital products and services to those neighborhoods affected by the e-commerce digital divide.
 
The Latino Market 
 
The name “Cuentas” is a Spanish word that has multiple meanings and was chosen for strategic reasons, to develop a close relationship with the Spanish speaking population. It means “Accounts” as in “bank accounts” and it can also mean “You can count on me” as in “Cuentas conmigo”. Additionally, it can be used to “Pay or settle accounts” (saldar cuentas), “accountability” (rendición de cuentas), “to be accountable” (rendir cuentas) and other significant meanings.
  
The 2020 U.S. Census showed the Hispanic Latino population at over 62 million and at 18.7% of the total U.S. population. The FDIC defines the “unbanked” “as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Company believes that the Hispanic and Latino demographic generally have had more identification, credit, and former bank account issues than any other U.S. minority group leading to more difficulty in obtaining a traditional bank account.
  
Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet
 
The Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet are positioned to service the Hispanic, Latino and immigrant demographics with comprehensive financial products. Additionally, we are able to accept various forms of U.S. and some foreign government issued identification to confirm qualification for opening an account with the Cuentas App. The Cuentas App is able to accept SSN or ITIN with U.S. identification, Matricula Consular or other qualified government issued forms of identification.
 
The Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® - General-Purpose Reloadable (GPR) Card
 
The Cuentas Prepaid GPR Card allows each account holder to have a personalized Cuentas Mastercard® and will allow them to have an associated Cuentas Account with the Mobile App, Digital Wallet, Digital Store and Long Distance Telecom services included. It will act as a comprehensive banking solution which enables access to the U.S. financial system for those who are unbanked or underbanked, while also enabling greater functionality than a traditional bank account. The cardholders’ deposited funds are currently protected in an FDIC-insured bank account at Sutton Bank and should be protected likewise with the new issuing bank.

Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was negative for the digital product and general purpose reloadable cards segment but slightly positive for wholesale which by its nature has a tiny markup and the telecommunications segment. The gross loss for the sale of digital product and general-purpose reloadable cards stemmed from ceasing all activities with Cuentas SDI LLC. In addition, in April 2023, CIMA, which provided maintenance and support services for our technology platform, shut down access to the platform as we were transitioning to a new, improved platform. During the first quarter of 2023, we reduced product availability to Cuentas-SDI to allow Cuentas-SDI to catch up on its payments and during the second quarter of 2023 we curtailed all services to Cuentas-SDI and marketing initiatives with Cuentas-SDI due to its inability to reduce its debt significantly. These disruptions to our fintech solutions and technology business were a major reason for the decline in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023. In May 2023, The OLB Group terminated a Software Licensing and Transaction Sharing Agreement with the Company for the purpose of upgrading the Cuentas Mobile App and digital distribution system. In June 2023, OLB acquired 80.01% of Cuentas-SDI. In July 2023, the Company and Cuentas-SDI settled certain payment issues and renewed discussions and cooperation to re-open the digital distribution network and systems through Cuentas-SDI’s convenience store distribution network of over 31,000 locations, including many across the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut tri state area.
 
Gross loss margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 11% consisting of 48% gross profit margin for the telecommunications segment and offset by a gross loss margin of 65% for the digital product and general purpose reloadable cards segment. The gross loss for the sale of digital product and general-purpose reloadable cards in the three months ended march 31, 2024 stemmed from the lower margins of our digital products since these sales derived from the sale of digital products bears minimal gross margins.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative Expenses and amortization of Intangible assets as discussed below and totaled $774,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1,627,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 representing a net decrease of $784,000.

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $772,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a net decrease of $853,000, or 52% compared to $1,625,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in our Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compare to the three months ended March 31, 2023, is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of $75,000 in officers compensation attributable to the departure of several directors during 2023 and the reduction in the number of the officers of the Company in 2023, decrease in the amount of $162,000 in Share-based compensation and shares issued for services, decrease in the amount of $120,000 in maintenance and support services that were provided by CIMA, decrease in the amount of $109,000 in professional services and a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $124,000 since the Company reduced significantly its selling and marketing campaigns starting 2023 due to its ineffectiveness and lack of resources, partially offset by increase of approximately $25,000 in the agreed payments in accordance with the processing service agreement with Incomm.

Amortization of Intangible Assets
 
Amortization of intangible assets totaled $2,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The amortization expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and are related to the amortization of domain name purchased on March 5, 2021.
 
Other Income ( Expenses )
 
Other income (expenses) totaled an income of $398,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Other income (expenses) are mainly comprised of Gain from Change in fair value of derivative warrants liability issued as part of our February 2023 and August 2023 security offering, partially offset by impairment expenses of prepaid expenses, interest expenses and other expenses of $93,000.
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized other income (expenses) totaled to $0.
 
Net Loss
 
We incurred a net loss of $445,000 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 1,695,000 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 due to the decrease in selling and general administrative expenses as described above.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.
 
As of March 31, 2024, the Company had total current assets of $492,000, including $28,000 of cash, accounts receivables of $290,000, related parties in the amount of $169,000 and other current assets of $5,000 and total current liabilities of $3,741,000 creating a working capital deficit of $3,249,000.
 
As of March 31, 2023, the Company had total current assets of $1,760,000, including $205,000 of cash, accounts receivables of $1,307,000, related parties in the amount of $172,000 and other current assets of $76,000. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had total current liabilities of $4,689,000 creating a negative working capital deficit of $2,929,000.
 
The increase in our working capital deficit was mainly due the increase in our negative cash flow from operations activities in the amount of in the amount of $310,000 partially mitigated by our Cash and Cash equivalents from financing activities in the amount of $133,000 due to proceeds from short terms loan received.
 
To date, we have principally financed our operations through the sale of our Common Stock. Nevertheless, management anticipates that our current cash and cash equivalents position and generating revenue from the sales of our digital products, General-Purpose Reloadable Cards and prepaid cellular phone services will provide us limited financial resources for the near future to continue implementing our business strategy of further developing our digital products, General Purpose Reloadable Card, enhance our digital products offering and increase our sales and marketing. Therefore management plans to secure additional financing sources, including but not limited to the sale of our Common Stock in future financings. This is expected to be used to further support our operations as described above and to complete the development of its new portal and financial technology capabilities. There can be no assurance, however, that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that the company will have net income from operations to fund the business plan of the company for the near future or long term. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $28,000 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $3,249,000 in negative working capital and an accumulated deficit of approximately $55,391,000. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as of March 31, 2024.

On April 3, 2024, Brooksville Development Partners, LLC (“BDP”), in which Cuentas has a 63.9% equity interest, entered into an agreement to sell the Brooksville Property for a purchase price of $7.2 million. The sale, which is expected to close before the end of the second quarter of 2024, is subject to certain conditions customary for similar real estate transactions. The purchaser has the right to terminate the agreement during an inspection period prior to June 3, 2024 due to title defects or other issues identified in a title report or survey of the premises or the existence of monetary liens not remedied or removed by BDP at the request of purchaser.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any.

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
 
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
 
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
 
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
 
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, and as discussed in greater detail below, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures are not effective: 
 
     ●    to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that are file under the Securities
           Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
           Exchange Commission’s rules and forms,
           and
 
     ●    to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are file or submitted under the Securities Exchange
           Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and our Treasurer, to allow timely decisions
           regarding required
           disclosure.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
 
On May 1, 2019, the Company received a notice of demand for arbitration from Secure IP Telecom, Inc. (“Secure IP), who allegedly had a Reciprocal Carrier Services Agreement (“RCS”) exclusively with Limecom and not with the Company. The arbitration demand originated from another demand for arbitration that Secure IP received from VoIP Capital International (“VoIP”) in March 2019, demanding $1,053 in damages allegedly caused by unpaid receivables that Limecom assigned to VoIP based on the RCS. On or about October 5, 2020, the trial court appointed a receiver over Limecom, Inc. (“Limecom”) in the matter of Spectrum Intelligence Communications Agency, LLC. v. Limecom, Inc., case no. 2018-027150-CA-01 pending in the 11th Circuit for Miami-Dade County, Florida. On June 5, 2020, Secure IP Telecom, Inc. (“Secure IP”) filed a complaint against Limecom, Heritage Ventures Limited (“Heritage”), an unrelated third party and owner of Limecom, and the Company, case no. 20-11972-CA-01. Secure IP alleges that the Company received certain transfers from Limecom during the period that the Company wholly owned Limecom that may be an avoidable under Florida Statute § 725.105. On July 13, 2021, the two cases were consolidated, and are now pending before the same trial court under the former case number. The Company has answered and denied any liability with respect to both complaints. To the extent the Company has exposure for any transfers from Limecom, Heritage has indemnified the Company for any such liability and the Company has a pending cross-claim against Heritage for purposes of enforcing the indemnification obligation. A review of the books and records of the Company reflect aggregate transfers from Limecom to the Company or its affiliates of less than $600,000. The Company’s books and records reflect that the Company fully reimbursed Limecom through direct payment of expenses of Limecom and through issuance of shares by the Company to employees or other vendors on behalf of Limecom for settlement and release of claims the employees or vendors may have asserted against Limecom. The books and records of the Company therefore do not reflect an identifiable avoidable transfer, but this analysis may change as the discovery process continues. At this time, based upon an analysis of the Company’s books and records, the loss contingency is not capable of reasonable estimation under the above circumstances, and the likelihood of an adverse judgment is not probable at this time. An adverse judgment in this matter is reasonably possible and based upon an analysis of litigation costs and likelihood of a settlement. As of December 31, 2023, the company accrued $300,000 due to this matter.
 
On October 4, 2022, Crosshair Media Placement, LLC, a Kentucky based marketing company, filed and served a complaint on Cuentas for breach of contract alleging breach of contract damages of $629,807.74, which case remains pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, case no. 3:22-CV-512-CHB. On May 9, 2023, the Company and the plaintiff attended a court settlement conference before the federal magistrate judge presiding over the matter. The parties reached a settlement that the Company will make the following installments in the amount of $630,000 to fully resolve the matter: $50,000 on or about June 1, $20,000 on or about July 1, and nine equal $15,000 monthly payments due the first of each month, then a final payment of $425,000 due May 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2023 the Company has paid $70,000 to the plaintiff under the above referenced settlement agreement.
 
On February 8, 2023, a former employee of the Company, filed a complaint for breach of employment agreement alleging the Company failed to pay her certain compensation she alleges she was entitled to upon her resignation.. The Company and the employee are discussing a settlement agreement and estimates that the maximum amount the Company will be required to pay will not exceed $30,000.
