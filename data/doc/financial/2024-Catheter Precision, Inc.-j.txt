Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations

 

The Company

 

Catheter Precision, Inc. ("Catheter" or the "Company or "Legacy RA Medical"), was incorporated in Delaware in July 2018. Catheter was initially formed to develop, commercialize and market its advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular and dermatological immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

 

On January 9, 2023, Catheter entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the "Merger Agreement", with Catheter Precision, Inc., or “Old Catheter”, a privately-held Delaware corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Old Catheter became a wholly owned subsidiary of Catheter, together referred to as the Company, in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, or the "Merger".

 

After the Merger and looking forward, the legacy Destruction of Arteriosclerotic Blockages by laser Radiation Ablation laser and single-use catheter, together referred to as "DABRA", and related assets were no longer used and Catheter’s legacy lines of business were discontinued, but instead the Company has shifted the focus of its operations to Old Catheter’s product lines. Accordingly, the Company’s current activities primarily relate to Old Catheter’s historical business which comprises the design, manufacture and sale of new and innovative medical technologies primarily focused in the field of cardiac electrophysiology, or EP.

 

The Company’s primary product is the VIVO System, which is an acronym for View into Ventricular Onset System (“VIVO” or “VIVO System”), is a non- invasive imaging system that offers 3D cardiac mapping to help with localizing the sites of origin of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with structurally normal hearts prior to EP procedures. The VIVO System has achieved a CE Mark allowing it to be commercialized in the European Union and has been placed at several hospitals in Europe. United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(K) clearance in the United States was received and the Company began a limited commercial release of VIVO in 2021.

 

The Company’s newest product, Surgical Vessel Closing Pressure Device ("LockeT"), is a suture retention device indicated for wound healing by distributing suture tension over a larger area in the patient in conjunction with a figure of eight suture closure and is intended to temporarily secure sutures and aid clinicians in locating and removing sutures efficiently. In addition, LockeT is a sterile, Class I product that was registered with the FDA in February 2023, at which time initial shipments began to distributors. Clinical studies for LockeT began during the year ended December 31, 2023. These studies are planned to show the product’s effectiveness and benefits, including faster wound closure, earlier ambulation, potentially leading to early hospital discharge, and cost benefits. This information is intended to provide crucial data for marketing and to expand the Company's indications for use with the FDA.

 

The Company’s product portfolio also includes the Amigo® Remote Catheter System (the "AMIGO" or "AMIGO System"), a robotic arm that serves as a catheter control device. Prior to 2018, Old Catheter marketed Amigo. The Company owns the intellectual property related to Amigo, and this product is under consideration for future research and development of a generation 2 product.

 

Prior to the Merger, Catheter developed an advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. DABRA was developed as a tool in the treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease which commonly occurs in the legs. The Company has ceased marketing and operations related to DABRA.

 

 

                                                                   7

Going Concern

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company used $1.9 million in cash for operating activities. The Company has incurred recurring net losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $278.4 million.

 

Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future as the Company invests in its commercial capabilities. These negative cash flows and additional costs associated with the Merger paid during the year ended December 31, 2023, have substantially depleted the Company’s cash. Following the Merger with Old Catheter, management further reduced staff and other costs while assuming the operating costs of Old Catheter. Management will continue to monitor its operating costs and seek to reduce its current liabilities. Such actions may impair its ability to proceed with certain strategic activities. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $1.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. This amount will not be sufficient to fund the Company's operations through the end of May 2025. Because expected revenues are not adequate to fund planned expenditures and anticipated operating costs beyond such point, the Company is currently evaluating potential means of raising cash through future capital transactions and/or bridge loans. If unable to do so, the Company will be required to reduce its spending rate to align with expected revenue levels and cash reserves, although there can be no guarantee that it will be successful in doing so. Accordingly, the Company will likely be required to raise additional cash through debt or equity transactions and/or bridge loans to continue operations. It may not be able to secure financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all.

 

As a result of these factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and Old Catheter. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP"). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) establishes these principles to ensure financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are consistently reported. Any reference in these notes to applicable accounting guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative nongovernmental GAAP as found in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). Certain footnotes and other financial information normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. The operating results presented herein are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the year. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 1, 2024.

 

 

                                                                   8

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are based upon a number of estimates including, but not limited to, the accounting for the Old Catheter business combination (see Note 3, Business Combination), allowance for credit losses, evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, reserves for warranty costs, fair value of royalties payable, evaluation of probable loss contingencies, fair value of preferred stock and warrants issued, and the fair value of equity awards granted.

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents represent short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents is based on the creditworthiness of the financial institutions at which these funds are held. The Company has cash balances at financial institutions which throughout the year may exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of any such financial institution, the Company evaluates the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits. Any material loss that the Company may experience in the future could have an adverse effect on its ability to pay its operational expenses or make other payments and may require the Company to move its cash to other high quality financial institutions. Currently, the Company is reviewing its bank relationships in order to mitigate its risk to ensure that its exposure is limited or reduced to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection limits.

 

The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable exist to the full extent of amounts presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company does not require collateral from its customers to secure accounts receivable.

 

The Company had three customers that represented more than 90% of the Companies consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and three customers that represented more than 79% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other hedging arrangements.

 

Segment Reporting

 

The Company operates in one business segment, which is the marketing, sales and development of medical technologies focused in the field of cardiac electrophysiology.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in readily available checking and money market accounts. The Company maintains deposits in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits of $250,000, in the amount of $1.2 million at March 31, 2024.

Fair Value Measurements

 

Fair value represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to identify inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

 

Level 2 - Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and

 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.

 

Cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at carrying value which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

 

The royalties payable have unobservable inputs that are not supported by any market data. As such the Company developed its own assumptions and identified the inputs as Level 3. The revenue adjusted discount rate (“RADR”) was calculated using a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) approach for the level 3 measurement. The RADR considers the WACC from the Company’s impairment analysis and adjusts certain inputs to represent the risk profile of the revenue. Under the cost of equity section, the risk-free rate has changed to be commensurate with the royalties payable term. Additionally, the Beta and Company Specific Risk Premium have been adjusted to Revenue Beta and Revenue Specific Risk Premium, respectively. This adjustment was calculated by multiplying the respective metric by the quotient of equity volatility over revenue volatility. The remaining inputs from the Impairment WACC have remained unchanged.

 

The following table details the fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments:

Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13)

 

Under the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") impairment model, the Company develops and documents its allowance for credit losses on its trade receivables based on three portfolio segments: Hospitals – United States, Hospitals – Europe, and Distributors. The determination of portfolio segments is based primarily on the customers’ industry and geographical location. 

 

Our quantitative allowance for credit loss estimates under CECL was determined using the method that uses an aging schedule. The Company also considers qualitative adjustments that may relate to unique risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to further inform our estimate of the allowance for credit losses.

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses

 

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, net of allowance for credit losses, if applicable, and are unsecured and do not bear interest. 

 

The allowance for credit losses is based on the probability of future collection under the CECL impairment model in which the Company determines its allowance by applying the method based on an aging schedule. The Company also considers reasonable and supportable current information in determining its estimated loss rates, such as external forecasts, macroeconomic trends or other factors including customers’ credit risk and historical loss experience. The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis. Account balances are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and the balance is deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance. Changes in the allowance are recorded as adjustments to bad debt expense in the period incurred.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there is no reserve for expected credit losses within accounts receivable.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for those items that were potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technological developments or other economic factors.

 

 

                                                                   11

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: 

 

Machinery and equipment                                                                                                       2-5 years

Computer hardware and software                                                                                                2-5 years

VIVO DEMO/Clinical Systems                                                                                                      2 years

Furniture and fixtures                                                                                                          5 years

 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the leasehold improvement or the term of the underlying property’s lease.

 

The Company periodically reviews the residual values and estimated useful lives of each class of its property and equipment for ongoing reasonableness, considering long-term views on its intended use of each class of property and equipment and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance assets within those classes.

 

When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account balances and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred, whereas significant betterments are capitalized.

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

In accordance with ASC 360, Impairment and Disposals of Long-lived Assets, the Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Should the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss at that date. 

 

As a result of the sustained decline of the Company's stock price from the date of the Merger, the Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment. To determine whether the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group is recoverable, the Company determined the estimated future cash flows of the group for a period consistent with that of the primary assets of the group. The sum of the undiscounted cash flows was then compared to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, as of March 31, 2024. The Company concluded there was no impairment as of March 31, 2024.

 

Goodwill

 

In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price of Old Catheter over the fair value of net assets acquired, is carried at cost. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based test. The Company reviews goodwill for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

 

 

                                                                   12

To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of an income and market approach. To determine fair values, the Company is required to make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations including the rate of future revenue growth, capital requirements, and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. These assumptions require significant judgment. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the single step is to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, the difference is the amount of the goodwill impairment. The Company also completes a reconciliation between the implied equity valuation prepared and the Company’s market capitalization. The majority of the inputs used in the discounted cash flow model are unobservable and thus are considered to be Level 3 inputs. The inputs for the market capitalization calculation are considered Level 1 inputs. There were impairment charges of $0 and $56.1 million  recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, see Note 3, Business Combination and Note 7, Goodwill, for additional details. As of December 31, 2023, goodwill was fully impaired.

 

Royalties Payable

 

The Company is obligated to pay royalties under various royalty agreements Old Cather had entered into.  On January 9, 2023, prior to the consummation of the Merger, Old Catheter entered in an agreement with its Convertible Promissory Noteholders (“Noteholders”), which substantially consisted of amounts due to David A. Jenkins, previously Old Catheter's Chairman of the Board of Directors prior to the Merger, and, currently, the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, to forgive all accrued interest and future interest expense in exchange for a future royalty right. The Company will pay to the Noteholders a total royalty equal to approximately 12% of net sales of LockeT, commencing upon the first commercial sale, through December 31, 2035 (see Note 10, Royalties Payable).

 

In addition, Old Catheter had entered into an agreement with the inventor of LockeT in exchange for the assignment and all rights to LockeT. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will pay a 5% royalty on net sales up to $1 million in royalties. After $1 million has been paid, and if, and only if, a U.S. patent is granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, then the Company will continue to pay a royalty at a rate of 2% of LockeT net sales, until total cumulative royalties of $10 million have been paid (see Note 10, Royalties Payable).

 

During 2006 and 2007, Old Catheter entered into two investment grant agreements with a non-profit foundation for the purpose of funding the initial development of Old Catheter's AMIGO System. The agreement calls for the payment to the foundation, upon successful commercialization of the AMIGO System (see Note 10, Royalties Payable).

 

As of the date of the Merger, the royalties payable had an estimated fair value of approximately $14.2 million. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the royalties payable had an estimated fair value of $7.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. At each reporting period, the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow method utilizing a RADR which was 24.1% as of January 9, 2023, 28.0% as of December 31, 2023 and 29.0% as of March 31, 2024.

 

Product Warranty

 

The Company’s current products are warrantied against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose and properly maintained.  

 

Similarly, the DABRA products were warrantied against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose and appropriately maintained. Accordingly, the Company generally replaced catheters that kinked or failed to calibrate. The product warranty liability was determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor. The product warranty liability also includes the estimated costs of a product recall. 

 

 

                                                                   13



Table of Contents

 

Warranty expenses are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Changes in estimates to previously established warranty accruals resulted from current period updates to assumptions regarding repair and product recall costs and are included in current period warranty expense. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no accrued warranty balance.

 

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity

 

The Company relies on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, to classify certain redeemable and/or convertible instruments. The Company first determines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company will determine the liability classification if the financial instrument is mandatorily redeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares.

 

Once the Company determines that a financial instrument should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability section and the equity section of the balance sheet. The Company will determine temporary equity classification if the redemption of the financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e. at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent equity.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), and all related appropriate guidance. The core principle of this standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

 

The Company measures revenue based upon the consideration specified in the client arrangement, and revenue is recognized when the performance obligations in the client arrangement are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service to the customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods. To achieve this core principal, the Company applies the following five steps:

 

Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer

 

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

 

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

 

Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation

 

The Company’s primary product in 2024 is the VIVO System. The VIVO System offers 3D cardiac mapping to help with localizing the sites of origin of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with structurally normal hearts prior to electrophysiology studies. In addition to the VIVO System, customers are provided with VIVO Positioning Patch Sets, which are custom patches, that are used in conjunction with the VIVO System to complete the intended output of the VIVO System. The delivery of the VIVO System, including the VIVO Positioning Patch Sets represents the Company’s primary performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue upon the delivery of the VIVO system. The Company also provides customers with the option to pay for software upgrades in advance at the time of the contract's inception. Software upgrades are stand-ready services, whereby the Company will provide software upgrade services to the customer when and as upgrades are available. Terms of the period covered by the payment of software upgrades in advance can range from one year to multiple years. Customers have the option to renew terms covered by software upgrades at the end of each term. The stand-ready software upgrades represent the Company's second separate performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the term of the period. 

 

 

                                                                   14



Table of Contents

 

The Company invoices the customers after physical possession and control of the VIVO System is transferred to the customer and recognizes revenue upon delivery. The timing of payment for the corresponding invoices is dependent upon the credit terms identified in each contract. The Company invoices customers who pay for software upgrades in advance in conjunction with the invoice for the delivery of the VIVO System, and subsequent renewals of software upgrades are invoiced at the inception of the term. Revenue for these stand-ready services is recognized evenly over the term of the upgrade period, consistently with similar stand-ready services under ASC 606. Similar to the delivery of the VIVO System, the timing of payment for the corresponding invoices is dependent upon the credit terms identified in each contract.  The Company has elected the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract, as incurred, as opposed to recognizing the cost as an asset upon occurrence.

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company records stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) issued to employees, members of the Company’s board of directors and consultants in accordance with the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation. The Company evaluates whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or equity award for all stock-based compensation awards granted. The cost of an award of an equity instrument is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model (“Black-Scholes model”) which incorporates various assumptions including expected term, volatility and risk-free interest rate, and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Share-based compensation for an award with a performance condition is recognized when the achievement of such performance condition is determined to be probable. If the outcome of such performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur. 

 

As a result of the Merger, all unvested Old Catheter stock options were subject to accelerated vesting and therefore became fully vested, as of the closing date of the business combination. The Company recognized the fair value of the replacement options as included in consideration transferred to the extent they do not exceed the fair value of the equivalent Old Catheter options. Any incremental fair value was recognized in compensation expense in the post-combination period, with this recognized as a Day 1 expense due to the Old Catheter options becoming fully vested concurrent with the closing of the business combination.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Any resulting net deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied. Should the Company incur interest and penalties relating to tax uncertainties, such amounts would be classified as a component of interest expense and other expense, respectively.

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share of Common Stock

 

The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. A net loss cannot be diluted so when the Company is in a net loss position, basic and diluted loss per common share are the same. If in the future the Company achieves profitability, the denominator of a diluted earnings per common share calculation will include both the weighted average number of shares outstanding and the number of common stock equivalents, if the inclusion of such common stock equivalents would be dilutive. Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share include warrants, stock options, non-vested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and Series X Convertible Preferred (see Note 12, Net loss per Share).

 

Net loss attributable to common stockholders consists of net income or loss, as adjusted for actual and deemed dividends declared. The Company recorded a deemed dividend for the modification of existing warrants and issuance of new warrants during the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $0.8 million. The deemed dividend is added to the net loss in determining the net loss available to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

 

Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. These amendments do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

The Merger was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Topic 805, and the Company has been determined to be the accounting acquirer.  The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. The preliminary purchase price allocation reflects various preliminary fair value estimates and analyses, including certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill, which were subject to change within the measurement period as preliminary valuations were being finalized (generally one year from the acquisition date). Measurement period adjustments were recorded in the reporting period in which the estimates are finalized, and adjustment amounts were determined. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments based on changes to certain estimates and assumptions and their related impact to the purchase price allocation. Developed technology was revised from $35.1 million to $27.0 million; trademarks were revised from $1.7 million to $1.3 million; customer relationships were revised from $220 thousand to $62 thousand; goodwill was revised from $56.0 million to $60.9 million; and royalties payable were revised from $7.6 million to $14.2 million.

Note 7. Goodwill

 

In connection with the Merger, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets assumed of $60.9 million was recognized as goodwill. The Merger was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Topic 805, and the Company has been determined to be the accounting acquirer.  The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments based on changes to certain estimates and assumptions and their related impact to the purchase price allocation. As a result, goodwill was revised from $56.0 million to $60.9 million.

 

The Company tests Goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. Due to a sustained decrease in the Company’s share price during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company concluded that, in accordance with ASC 350, a triggering event occurred indicating that potential impairment exists and required the Company to assess if impairment exists as of March 31, 2023. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which resulted in the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeding the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, indicating that the goodwill of the reporting unit was impaired. The Company utilized a combination of an income and market approach to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach considered the discounted cash flow model, considering projected future cash flows (including timing and profitability), discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rate, and projected future economic and market conditions. The guideline public company market approach considered marketplace earnings multiples from within a peer public company group.  As of December 31, 2023, cumulative goodwill impairment charges of $60.9 million were incurred related to the Company’s single reporting unit and no goodwill remained as of this date.

The Company's lease agreements generally do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Therefore, the Company used a benchmark approach to derive an appropriate imputed discount rate. The Company benchmarked itself against other companies with similar credit ratings and of comparable quality and derived an imputed rate, which was used in a portfolio approach to discount its real estate lease liabilities. Management used an estimated incremental borrowing rate as detailed below for each lease.

South Carolina Office Lease Agreement

 

On September 27, 2022, Old Catheter entered into a lease agreement for office space located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The space is used for office and general use. The term of the lease began on October 1, 2022, is 38 months, and includes two months of free rental from the commencement date of the lease. The lease contains two separate 36 month renewal periods, which require 180 days notice of the Company's intention to exercise. As of the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company does not intend to exercise either of the two extension options. Total rent is $3,435 per month for the first ten months following the two months of free rent, with annual increases on the anniversary of the effective date. The Company has adopted the practical expedient under Topic 842, which permits the Company to account for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease payment. As a result, beginning at lease inception on October 1, 2022, the Company recognized both the lease payments and associated common area maintenance payments as a single lease payment. The Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate of 11.09% for this lease agreement.

 

New Jersey Office Lease Agreement

 

On December 7, 2022, Old Catheter entered into a lease agreement for office space located in Augusta, New Jersey. The space is used for office and general use.

Note 12. Net Loss per Share

 

The Company’s outstanding warrants to purchase common stock have participation rights to any dividends that may be declared in the future and are therefore considered to be participating securities. Participating securities have the effect of diluting both basic and diluted earnings per share during periods of income. During periods of loss, no loss is allocated to the participating securities since the holders have no contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company. 

 

Anti-dilutive common share equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share at March 31, 2024 consisted of Series A convertible preferred stock of 2,313,956 shares, Series X Convertible Preferred Stock of 12,656,011 shares, warrants of 11,042,137, stock options of 614,593, and no restricted stock awards or restricted stock units.

 

Anti-dilutive common share equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share at March 31, 2023 consisted of Series A convertible preferred stock of 4,501,060 shares, Series X convertible preferred stock of 12,656,011 shares, warrants of 11,148,858, stock options of 452,908, restricted stock awards of 556, and restricted stock units of 26.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consists of net loss, as adjusted for deemed dividends. The Company recorded a deemed dividend for the modification of existing warrants and issuance of the Series E warrants (see Note 13, Equity Offerings) of $0.8 million, during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Note 13. Equity Offerings

 

Warrant Inducement Offer

 

On January 9, 2023, the Company reduced the exercise price of certain existing warrants (the "Existing Warrants"), exercisable for 331,608 shares of the Company’s common stock held by a certain investor (the “Investor”), with exercise prices ranging from $14.00 to $526.50 per share to $4.00 per share (the "2023 Warrant Repricing"). In connection with the 2023 Warrant Repricing, the Company entered into a warrant inducement offer letter (the "2023 Inducement Letter"), with the Investor pursuant to which it would exercise up to all of the 331,608 Existing Warrants (the "Inducement Offer"). In consideration for exercising the Existing Warrants pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Inducement Letter, the Company received approximately $1.3 million in gross proceeds. The Company paid the placement agent aggregate cash fees of approximately $0.2 million related to the Inducement Offer which represented 8.0% of the gross proceeds received from the Inducement Offer plus other offering costs resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $1.1 million. In consideration for exercising the Existing Warrants pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Inducement Letter, the Company issued the Investor a new Series E common stock purchase warrant, or Series E Warrant (the "Series E Warrant"), to purchase 331,608 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The Series E Warrant is exercisable for five years from the date of stockholder approval. Exercise of the Series E Warrant in full was subject to approval of the Company's stockholders other than the Investor, which was obtained at a special meeting of the Company's stockholders held on March 21, 2023 (the "Stockholders' Meeting"). The incremental fair value of the repriced warrants amounted to $0.3 million and the fair value of Series E warrant totaled $1.9 million.  The relative fair value of such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in capital concurrent with the exercise of the Existing Warrants.

 

As a result of the 2023 Warrant Repricing and Inducement Offer, the Company presents a deemed dividend for the modification of Existing Warrants and issuance of the Series E Warrants of $0.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The deemed dividend was included in net loss attributable to common stockholders in the calculation of net loss per share in the unaudited consolidated condensed statements of operations.

 

The warrants, other than the Series E Warrants which are presented in a separate table below, were valued on the date of the 2023 Warrant Repricing using the Black-Scholes model based on the following assumptions:

Private Placement

 

On January 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Securities Purchase Agreement”) for a private placement (“Private Placement”), with the Investor. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Investor agreed to purchase, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.0 million, (a) Class A units at a price that was the lower of $3.00 per unit and 90% of the 5 day volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock immediately prior to obtainment of the approval of the Company’s stockholders of conversion of the PIPE Preferred Stock and PIPE Warrants (as each are defined below), each consisting of one share of common stock, one Series F common stock purchase warrant, or Series F Warrant, and one Series G common stock purchase warrant, or Series G Warrant, and together with the Series F Warrants (the “PIPE Warrants”) and (b) Class B units at a price of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of one share of a new series of the Company’s preferred stock, designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “PIPE Preferred Stock”), par value $0.0001, and one Series F Warrant and one Series G Warrant for each share of the Company’s common stock underlying the PIPE Preferred Stock (each share of which is convertible into a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $1,000 divided by the lower of $3.00 and 90% of the 5 day volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock immediately prior to the obtainment of the approval of the Company’s stockholders of conversion of the PIPE Preferred Stock and PIPE Warrants, or the Preferred Conversion Rate). The closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement and the sale and issuance of the Class A units and Class B units (and the issuance of any underlying common stock) were approved at the Stockholders’ Meeting. At the closing of the Private Placement, the Company issued 497,908 Class A units for proceeds of approximately $0.9 million and 7,203 Class B units for proceeds of approximately $7.1 million which were convertible into up to 4,501,060 shares of common stock, as well as the issuance of warrants described below.

 

The PIPE Warrants, including Series F warrants and Series G warrants, are exercisable at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the PIPE Warrants. The PIPE Warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the closing date of the Private Placement until the expiration thereof, except that the PIPE Warrants cannot be exercised if, after giving effect thereto, the purchaser would beneficially own more than 4.99%, or the Maximum Percentage, of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, which Maximum Percentage may be increased or decreased by the purchaser with written notice to the Company to any other percentage specified not in excess of 9.99%. The Series F Warrants have a term of two years from the date of stockholder approval, and the Series G Warrants have a term of six years from the date of stockholder approval. The Series F Warrants and Series G Warrants were approved at the Stockholders’ Meeting.

 

The Series F warrants and Series G warrants were valued, in aggregate, at approximately $5.5 million using the Black-Scholes model based on the following assumptions:

The proceeds from the Securities Purchase Agreement were allocated to the equity instruments issued based on their relative fair values and recorded in additional paid-in capital.

 

Shares of PIPE Preferred Stock, the conversion of which was approved at the Stockholders’ Meeting, convert into common stock at the option of the holder at the Preferred Conversion Rate, subject to certain ownership limitations as described below. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions.

 

Subject to limited exceptions, holders of shares of PIPE Preferred Stock will not have the right to convert any portion of their Preferred Stock if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or up to 9.99% at the election of the holder) of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion.

 

Holders of PIPE Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive dividends on shares of PIPE Preferred Stock equal, on an as-if-converted-to-common stock basis, and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock. Except as otherwise required by law, the PIPE Preferred Stock does not have voting rights.

 

The Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers requiring the Company to register the resale of the shares of common stock, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the shares issuable upon the conversion of the PIPE Preferred Stock. 

 

Placement Fees

 

In connection with offerings completed by the Company in 2022, (the "2022 Offerings"), the Company entered into an agreement with a placement agent that, subject to satisfaction of the requirements contained therein, called for a placement fee payable based on capital raised from certain investors for a definitive time following the expiration of the agreement. The accrued placement fee of approximately $1.4 million related to the 2022 Offerings is included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, the agreement called for the issuance of warrants with the following terms:

Note 14. Preferred Stock

 

Series X Convertible Preferred Stock

 

As described in Note 3, above, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all Old Catheter common stock shares issued and outstanding and convertible promissory notes, representing an aggregate principal of $25.2 million, were converted into a right to receive 14,649.592 shares of a new class of the Company’s preferred stock, designated Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

Series X Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights prior to the conversion into common stock. While there are generally no voting rights of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, there are protective rights regarding the sales of the company, change of control, etc. No currently outstanding share of Series X Preferred may convert into common stock until on or after July 9, 2024, and then, only if the Company’s common stock has been delisted from the NYSE American or has been approved for initial listing on the NYSE American or another stock exchange, at a rate of 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

 

                                                                   29

Upon consummation of the Merger, each holder of Old Catheter convertible promissory notes received, in exchange for discharge of the principal of his or its Notes, a number of shares of the Company's Series X Convertible Preferred Stock representing a potential right to convert into the Company's common stock in an amount equal to one common share for each $3.20 of principal amount.

 

On March 21, 2023, the Company held the Stockholders' Meeting, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, the issuance of 1,993,581 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 1,993.581 of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock which were issued upon the closing of the Merger, see Note 3, Business Combination. On March 23, 2023, the Company issued 1,974,905 shares of common stock upon the conversion of 1,974.905 of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock. On October 24, 2023, the remaining 18,676 shares of common stock were issued upon the conversion of 18.676 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock. The remaining 12,656.011 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock are expected to remain outstanding until at least July 9, 2024, and will convert thereafter up to 12,656,011 shares of common stock, only if the Company meets the initial listing standards of the NYSE American or another national securities exchange or is delisted from the NYSE American.

 

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

 

As described in Note 13, on January 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a Private Placement with the Investor. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were issued, the conversion of which was approved at the Stockholders’ Meeting. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converts into common stock at the option of the holder at the Preferred Conversion Rate, subject to certain ownership limitations as described below. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions.

 

Subject to limited exceptions, holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will not have the right to convert any portion of their Series A Convertible Preferred Stock if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion.

 

Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive dividends on shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock equal, on an as-if-converted-to-common stock basis, and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock. Except as otherwise required by law, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock does not have voting rights.

 

The Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers requiring the Company to register the shares of common stock, issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The shares have been registered for resale on an effective registration statement on Form S-1.

 

The following conversions of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock occurred subsequent to the issuance:

Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 625 shares of common stock. The common stock was issued pursuant to the exemption contained in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), which applies to transactions in which a security is exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange.  The shares issued have been registered for resale on an effective registration statement on Form S-1.

 

Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation

 

2018 Equity Incentive Plan

 

In September 2018, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) which provided for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and other forms of equity compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2018 Plan generally vest one-fourth on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the balance vesting monthly over the remaining three years. Restricted stock units granted under the 2018 Plan generally vest one third on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and one sixth every six months thereafter such that the award will be fully vested on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date. In July 2023, the 2018 Plan was replaced by the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2023 Plan"), as described below. As of July 2023, no additional awards could be made under the 2018 Plan and no shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance.

 

2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

 

In September 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) which permitted eligible employees to purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. Eligible employees could elect to withhold up to 15% of their base earnings to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or the purchase date, whichever was lower. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP automatically increased on January 1 of each fiscal year by the lesser of (1) 237 shares, (2) 1.25% of the total number of shares outstanding on December 31 of the preceding fiscal year, or (3) such other amount as the Company’s board of directors may determine.

 

The Company paused the ESPP in May 2022 and in April 2024, the Company formally terminated the ESPP. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, no cash was received from the exercise of purchase rights under the ESPP.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had issued 950 shares of common stock since inception of the ESPP, and 26 shares were reserved for future issuance. Upon termination of the ESPP in April 2024, the reserved shares were released back to the authorized pool.

 

2020 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan

 

In March 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) for the purpose of attracting, retaining and incentivizing employees in furtherance of the Company’s success. The 2020 Plan was adopted without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 303A.08 of the New York Stock Exchange. The 2020 Plan is used to offer equity awards as material inducements for new employees to join the Company. Upon adoption of the 2020 Plan, 640 shares of common stock were reserved for the granting of inducement stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and other forms of equity awards. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 540 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan. In April 2024, the Company terminated the 2020 Plan at which time the reserved shares were released back to the authorized pool.

 

Stock Options Assumed in Merger (See Note 3, Business Combination)

 

At the closing of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase Old Catheter common stock that had not previously been exercised prior to the closing of the Merger was assumed and converted into options to purchase 753,699 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Replacement Options”). Additionally, no Old Catheter options were amended in connection with the Merger. All the Replacement Options vested in accordance with the original terms of the grants in place at the time of the Merger. As a result, $3.4 million of purchase price consideration, which represented the estimated fair value of Old Catheter’s assumed stock options, and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the Replacement Options over the assumed Old Catheter stock options, were recognized upon the closing of the Merger.

 

2023 Equity Incentive Plan

 

In July 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2023 Plan, as defined above, which provided for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and other forms of equity compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and consultants.  Stock options granted under the 2023 Plan to employees and consultants generally will vest annually over a five-year period or as determined by the Board’s Compensation Committee, while grants to non-employee directors generally vest quarterly over a three-year period.  As of  March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 146,546 and 501,868 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance pursuant to the 2023 Plan.  The number of shares available for issuance under the 2023 Plan also includes a quarterly increase commencing on September 1, 2023 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 10% of the number equal to the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the applicable adjustment date less the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the adjustment date, but if such number is a negative number, then the increase will be zero; or (ii) such lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Board. 

 

On January 8, 2024, the Board approved the issuance of a total of 285,000 non-qualified stock options under the 2023 Plan. 75,000 of these non-qualified options were issued to non-employee directors that vest at 8 1/3% per quarter for 3 years with an exercise price of $0.40 and expiration date of January 8, 2034. The remaining 210,000 non-qualified options were issued to employees and consultants and vest at 20% per year for 5 years with an exercise price of $0.40 and expiration date of January 8, 2034.

 

On February 26, 2024, the Board approved the issuance of a total of 150,000 incentive stock options under the 2023 Plan. All options were issued to employees and vest at 20% per year for 5 years with an exercise price of $0.43 and expiration date of February 26, 2034.

 

The options issued during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 were valued at approximately $170 thousand using the Black-Scholes model based on the following assumptions on the date of issue:

Note 16. Income Taxes 

 

The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets.  The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future.

 

The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of March 31, 2024, except for the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration sales and use tax audit. The period covered by the audit is October 1, 2020 through March 31, 2023.

 

Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies

 

In the normal course of business, the Company is at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions. In management’s opinion, any potential loss resulting from the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding litigation.

 

 

                                                                   33

Note 18. Employee Benefit Plan

 

In January 2019, the Company established a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“401(k) Plan”). Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, all full-time employees were eligible to make voluntary contributions as a percentage or defined amount of compensation. The Company made matching contributions based on 100% of each employee’s contribution up to 3% and 50% of contributions between 3% and 5%, with the match-eligible contribution limited to 4% of the employee’s eligible compensation. The Company cancelled the 401(k) Plan effective March 10, 2023 and distributed all assets held by the 401(k) Plan to the participants. The Company had no expenses related to the matching contributions for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Overview

 

The registrant (together with our consolidated operating subsidiary, the “Company” or “Catheter”) was incorporated under the name “Ra Medical Systems, Inc.” as a Delaware corporation in July 2018.  A predecessor had been incorporated in California in September of 2002, but was reincorporated in 2018 in connection with our initial public offering.  The Company was initially formed to develop, commercialize and market an excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular and dermatological immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including the DABRA product line.

 

On January 9, 2023, the Company merged with the former Catheter Precision, Inc., or “Old Catheter”, a privately-held Delaware corporation (the “Merger”), and the business of Old Catheter became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which today is our only operating subsidiary. Following the Merger, we discontinued the Company’s legacy lines of business and the use of any of its DABRA-related assets. For further information about these historical lines of business, see “Item 1. Business” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.  Since the Merger, we have shifted the focus of our operations to Old Catheter’s product lines. Accordingly, our current activities primarily relate to Old Catheter’s historical business which comprises the design, manufacture and sale of new and innovative medical technologies focused in the field of cardiac electrophysiology, or “EP.”

 

Our primary product is the View into Ventricular Onset System or VIVO System (“VIVO” or “VIVO System”) which is a non-invasive imaging system that offers 3D cardiac mapping to help with localizing the sites of origin of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with structurally normal hearts prior to EP procedures.

 

Our newest product, LockeT, is a suture retention device indicated for wound healing by distributing suture tension over a larger area in the patient in conjunction with a figure of eight suture closure. LockeT is intended to temporarily secure sutures and aid clinicians in locating and removing sutures efficiently.

 

Our product portfolio also includes the Amigo® Remote Catheter System, or Amigo, a robotic arm that serves as a catheter control device. Prior to 2018, Old Catheter marketed Amigo. We own the intellectual property related to Amigo, and this product is under consideration for future research and development of a generation 2 product.

 

Pre-Merger Operations

 

The Company owns intellectual property related to an advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The Destruction of Arteriosclerotic Blockages by laser Radiation Ablation, laser and single-use catheter, together referred to as the DABRA Excimer Laser System or DABRA, was developed as a tool in the treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease which commonly occurs in the legs. The Company also previously marketed the Pharos laser which was used to treat proliferative skin conditions. The Company completed the sale of its Pharos laser business, or Dermatology Business, to STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. on August 16, 2021. 

 

The board of directors approved a reduction in force ("RIF") effective June 6, 2022, under which approximately 65% of Ra Medical's full-time employees were immediately terminated and provided one-time severance payments totaling approximately $0.6 million. In August and September 2022, an additional 20% of Legacy Ra Medical's employees were terminated and provided one-time severance payments totaling approximately $0.3 million. The purpose of the RIF was to preserve capital with the goal of maximizing the opportunities available to Legacy Ra Medical during the board of directors’ review of strategic alternatives.

 

 

                                                                   37



Table of Contents

 

As a result of the RIF and the board of directors’ review of strategic alternatives, the Company paused all engineering activities in June 2022. The Company has ceased marketing the DABRA Excimer Laser System and does not currently intend to commercialize the DABRA 2.0 catheter.

 

Post-Merger Operations

 

Looking forward, we do not expect to use our legacy DABRA-related assets or continue the Company's legacy lines of business, but instead have shifted the focus of our operations to Old Catheter’s product lines. Accordingly, our current activities primarily relate to Old Catheter’s historical business, which comprises the design, manufacture and sale of new and innovative medical technologies focused in the field of cardiac electrophysiology, or EP.

 

Our primary product is the VIVO System. We are focused on the design, market development and usage adoption of our VIVO System by cardiac electrophysiologists to enhance their ability to diagnose and treat cardiac arrhythmias. We have completed development, received regulatory clearance, and initiated sales of the VIVO System in the U.S. and Europe.

 

Our business strategy is to become a leading medical imaging company in the field of cardiac electrophysiology, and we are dedicated to developing and delivering electrophysiology products to provide patients, hospitals, and physicians with novel technologies and solutions to improve the lives of patients with cardiac arrhythmias. We aim to establish VIVO as an integral tool used by cardiac electrophysiologists during ablation treatment of ventricular arrhythmias by reducing procedure time and patient complications and increasing procedural success.

 

We have received FDA clearance to market and promote the VIVO System in the United States as a pre-procedure planning tool for patients with structurally normal hearts undergoing ablation treatment for idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. VIVO allows for the acquisition, analysis, display and storage of cardiac electrophysiological data and maps for analysis by a physician. We began a limited commercial launch of VIVO in 2021 and to date, VIVO has been utilized in more than 1,000 procedures in the U.S. and EU by over 30 physicians, with no reported device-related complications. 

 

We have been cleared to label the VIVO System with the CE Mark in the EU and certain other countries. The CE Mark designation, which affirms the product’s conformity with European health, safety, and environmental protection standards, allows us to market that product in countries that are members of the EU and the European Free Trade Association. Catheter has commenced limited sales of the VIVO System in Europe and the UK through independent distributors. Catheter’s international distributors are supported by two EU based full time consultants.

 

In addition, LockeT, a suture retention device, is a sterile, Class I product that was registered with the FDA in February 2023, at which time we began initial shipments to distributors. In May 2023, Catheter submitted LockeT for CE Mark approval. CE Mark approval is expected in the second half of 2024, at which time initial international shipments to distributors will begin. LockeT is indicated for wound healing by distributing suture tension over a larger area in the patient in conjunction with a figure of eight suture closure, and it is intended to temporarily secure sutures and aid clinicians in locating and removing sutures efficiently.

 

Clinical studies for LockeT began during the year ended December 31, 2023. The three phases of the current studies are planned to show the product’s effectiveness and benefits, including faster wound closure, earlier ambulation, potentially leading to early hospital discharge, and lower costs for the healthcare provider and/or insurance payor. This data is intended to provide crucial data for marketing and to expand our indications for use with the FDA.

 

 

                                                                   38

On December 28, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S., acting through the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General, and other settlement agreements with certain state attorneys general (collectively the "Settlement Agreements"), to resolve investigations and a related civil action concerning its marketing of the DABRA laser system and DABRA-related remuneration to certain physicians. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreements, if the Company was acquired or was otherwise involved in a change in control transaction (as defined in the Settlement Agreements) before the end of 2024, the Company was required to pay a settlement amount of $5.0 million. As a result of the Merger, the Company made payments of $4.7 million and $0.3 million to the DOJ and participating states, respectively, in February 2023.

 

Warrant Inducement Offer

 

On January 9, 2023, we reduced the exercise price of certain existing warrants, or the Existing Warrants, exercisable for 331,608 shares of the Company's common stock held by a certain investor (the “Investor”), with exercise prices ranging from $14.00 to $526.50 per share to $4.00 per share, or the Warrant Repricing. In connection with the Warrant Repricing, we entered into a warrant inducement offer letter, or the Inducement Letter, with the Investor pursuant to which it would exercise up to all of the 331,608 Existing Warrants, or the Inducement Offer. In consideration for exercising the Existing Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Inducement Letter, we received approximately $1.3 million in gross proceeds. We paid the placement agent aggregate cash fees of approximately $0.2 million related to the Inducement Offer which represented 8.0% of the gross proceeds received from the Inducement Offer plus other offering costs. In consideration for exercising the Existing Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Inducement Letter, we issued the Investor a new Series E common stock purchase warrant, or Series E Warrant, to purchase 331,608 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The Series E Warrant is exercisable for five years from the date of stockholder approval. Exercise of the Series E Warrant in full was approved by the Company's stockholders at the special Stockholders’ Meeting held on March 21, 2023. The incremental fair value of the repriced warrants amounted to $0.3 million and the fair value of Series E warrant totaled $1.9 million.  The relative fair values of such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in capital concurrent with the exercise of the Existing Warrants. The Company registered the shares of common stock underlying the Series E Warrant for resale in February 2023.

 

Securities Purchase Agreement

 

On January 9, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement"), for a private placement (the "Private Placement"), with the Investor. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, on March 23, 2023, the Investor purchased, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.0 million, (a) 497,908 Class A Units at a price of $1.60029 per Class A Unit, each consisting of one share of common stock, one Series F Common Stock Purchase Warrant, or Series F Warrant, and one Series G Common Stock Purchase Warrant, or Series G Warrant, and together with the Series F Warrant, the PIPE Warrants, and (b) 4,501,060 Class B Units at a price of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of one share of a new series of the Company’s preferred stock, designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001, or the PIPE Preferred Stock, and one Series F Warrant and one Series G Warrant for each share of the Company’s common stock underlying the PIPE Preferred Stock, each share of which is convertible into approximately 625 shares of the Company’s common stock, or the Preferred Conversion Rate. The closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement and the sale and issuance of the Class A Units and Class B Units (and the issuance of any underlying common stock) was approved at the special Stockholders’ Meeting held March 21, 2023. 

 

 

                                                                   39

The PIPE Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the PIPE Warrants. The PIPE Warrants are exercisable at any time until the expiration thereof, except that the PIPE Warrants cannot be exercised if, after giving effect thereto, the purchaser would beneficially own more than 4.99%, or the Maximum Percentage, of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, which Maximum Percentage may be increased or decreased by the purchaser with written notice to the Company to any other percentage specified not in excess of 9.99%. The Series F Warrants have a term of two years from the date of stockholder approval, and the Series G Warrants have a term of six years from the date of stockholder approval. Stockholder approval of the Series F Warrants and Series G Warrants was obtained at the special Stockholders’ Meeting held on March 21, 2023.

 

Shares of PIPE Preferred Stock, the conversion of which was approved at the special Stockholders’ Meeting held on March 21, 2023, convert into common stock at the option of the holder at the Preferred Conversion Rate, subject to certain ownership limitations as described below. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions.

 

Subject to limited exceptions, holders of shares of PIPE Preferred Stock do not have the right to convert any portion of their Preferred Stock if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion.

 

Holders of PIPE Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on shares of PIPE Preferred Stock equal, on an as-if-converted-to-common stock basis, and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock. Except as otherwise required by law, the PIPE Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. However, as long as any shares of PIPE Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the PIPE Preferred Stock, (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the PIPE Preferred Stock, (b) alter or amend the Certificate of Designation for the PIPE Preferred Stock, (c) amend its certificate of incorporation or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holders of PIPE Preferred Stock, (d) increase the number of authorized shares of PIPE Preferred Stock, or (e) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. The PIPE Preferred Stock does not have a preference upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company. The holders of PIPE Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company the same amount that a holder of the Company’s common stock would receive if the PIPE Preferred Stock were fully converted (disregarding for such purposes any conversion limitations) to the Company’s common stock, which amounts will be paid pari passu with all holders of the Company’s common stock.

 

The Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers requiring the Company to register the resale of the shares of its common stock, the shares issuable upon exercise of the PIPE Warrants and the shares issuable upon the conversion of the PIPE Preferred Stock. These registration statements were declared effective in April 2023.

 

The net proceeds from the Private Placement and the Warrant Repricing have been used to advance the development and commercialization of our novel electrophysiology technologies and solutions and to support general corporate purposes.

Adoption of 2023 Equity Incentive Plan

 

On July 11, 2023, we held an Annual Meeting where our stockholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (“2023 Plan”) that authorizes us to grant options, restricted stock and other equity-based awards. No issuance of options were granted under the 2023 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, options to purchase an aggregate of 410,000 shares were outstanding and 146,546 shares remain available for grant under the 2023 Plan, subject to adjustment as provided therein. See Note 20, Subsequent Events, of our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of option grants made subsequent to March 31, 2024. 

 

Components of our Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

Revenues 

 

Product sales revenues prior to the Merger consisted of sales of catheters for use with the DABRA laser in our atherectomy clinical trials.

 

After the Merger, our legacy DABRA laser is no longer in use and we have shifted the focus of our operations to Old Catheter’s product lines. Accordingly, our current activities primarily relate to Old Catheter’s historical business which comprises the design, manufacture and sale of new and innovative medical technologies focused in the field of cardiac electrophysiology, or EP.

 

Our primary product in 2024 is the VIVO System. The VIVO System offers 3D cardiac mapping to help with localizing the sites of origin of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with structurally normal hearts prior to electrophysiology studies. In addition to the VIVO System, customers are provided with VIVO Positioning Patch Sets, which are custom patches, that are used in conjunction with the VIVO System to complete the intended output of the VIVO System. The delivery of the VIVO System, including the VIVO Positioning Patch Sets represents our primary performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of the VIVO system. We also provide customers with the option to pay for software upgrades in advance at the time of the contract's inception. Software upgrades are stand-ready services, whereby we will provide software upgrade services to the customer when and as upgrades are available. Terms of the period covered by the payment of software upgrades in advance can range from one year to multiple years. Customers have the option to renew terms covered by software upgrades at the end of each term. The stand-ready software upgrades represent our second separate performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the term of the period. 

 

 

                                                                   41



Table of Contents

 

We invoice the customers after physical possession and control of the VIVO System is transferred to the customer and recognize revenue upon delivery. The timing of payment for the corresponding invoices is dependent upon the credit terms identified in each contract. We invoice customers who pay for software upgrades in advance in conjunction with the invoice for the delivery of the VIVO System, and subsequent renewals of software upgrades are invoiced at the inception of the term. Revenue for these stand-ready services is recognized evenly over the term of the upgrade period, consistently with similar stand-ready services under ASC 606. Similar to the delivery of the VIVO System, the timing of payment for the corresponding invoices is dependent upon the credit terms identified in each contract. We have elected the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract, as incurred, as opposed to recognizing the cost as an asset upon occurrence. 

 

We are a business that has operations within multiple countries. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 90% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. This shift of revenue to predominantly international customers is a result of timing of orders placed and not expected to continue.

 

Cost of Revenues

 

Cost of revenues for product sales consisted primarily of costs of components for use in our products, the labor used to produce our products, and the manufacturing overhead that supports production.

 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

 

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A"), expenses consist of employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses. Other SG&A expenses include amortization of intangible assets and accretion of royalties payable acquired in the Merger (for the three months ended March 31, 2023), professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and facility-related expenses.

 

Research and Development Expenses

 

Research and development ("R&D"), expenses are expensed as incurred and include the following: research grants; product development; cost of clinical studies to support new products and product enhancements, including expanded indications; supplies used for internal R&D and clinical activities; and cost of outside consultants who assist with technology development and clinical affairs.

 

 

                                                                   42

Revenues

 

The decrease in revenues of approximately $3 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due to lower product sales of the VIVO System products.

 

Cost of Revenues

 

The decrease in cost of revenues of approximately $5 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due to the lower cost of revenues of the VIVO Positioning Patches. During 2024, changes to the manufacturing process of the Vivo Positioning Patches led to a reduction in the manufacturing cost of approximately 40%.

 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

 

The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in salaries and benefits of $2.0 million relating to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, a decrease in legal fees of $2.0 million that were primarily incurred in connection with the Merger, a decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.4 million that resulted from intangible assets acquired in the Merger, of which the useful lives and fair value of those intangible assets were finalized during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Further, a decrease in stock based compensation of approximately $1.4 million, of which, $1.3 million was related to the one time stock compensation for Old Catheter stock options assumed in the Merger, a decrease of accounting/audit fees of approximately $0.5 million, a decrease of investor relations and SEC fees of approximately $0.1 million, a decrease in other selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 million, and a decrease of other fees of approximately $0.1 million. 

 

Research and Development Expenses

 

The decrease in research and development expenses of approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in clinical study costs of $0.1 million. This decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuation of the historical products of Ra Medical that were under development. 

 

 

                                                                   43

Impairment Charges

 

We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting level annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. As a result of the Merger with Old Catheter the Company recognized $56.1 million of goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Due to a sustained decrease in our share price during the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, we concluded that in accordance with ASC 350 a triggering event occurred indicating that potential impairment exists that required us to assess if impairment existed as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. In accordance with ASC 350 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which resulted in the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, indicating that the goodwill of the reporting unit was impaired.  We utilized a combination of an income and market approach to assess the fair value of the reporting unit as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. The income approach considered the discounted cash flow model, considering projected future cash flows (including timing and profitability), discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rate, and projected future economic and market conditions while the guideline public company market approach considered marketplace earnings multiples from within a peer public company group. We recorded the impairment charge of $60.9 million within loss on impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2023, cumulative goodwill impairment charges of $60.9 million were incurred related to our single reporting unit. The remaining balance of goodwill was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2023.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, no impairment charges were incurred.

 

Change in fair value of royalties payable

 

As of the date of the Merger, the royalties payable was calculated using a discounted cash flow method utilizing a discount rate of 24.1%. From the Merger date through March 31, 2023, the Company's accounting policy was to accrete the royalties payable, which was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. Subsequent to March 31, 2023, the Company changed its accounting policy to remeasure the royalties payable and record it at fair value, which is presented within other income on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. At each reporting period, the fair value of the royalties payable is calculated using the discounted cash flow method. At March 31, 2024, the discount rate was 29%, The change in fair value of the royalties payable for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was a decrease of $0.1 million. The change between three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is driven by both the change in fair value of the royalties payable as well the change in accounting policy. 

 

Other income, Net

 

The decrease in other income (expense), net of approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in investment income.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $278.4 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used from operating activities was approximately $1.9 million. We have incurred recurring net losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception.

 

 

                                                                   44



Table of Contents

 

We expect operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future as we invest in our commercial capabilities. These negative cash flows and additional costs associated with the Merger paid during the year ended December 31, 2023 have substantially depleted our cash. Following the Merger with Old Catheter, we further reduced staff and other costs while assuming the operating costs of Old Catheter. We will continue to monitor our operating costs and seek to reduce our current liabilities. Such actions may impair our ability to proceed with certain strategic activities. As of March 31, 2024, we had $1.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this amount will not be sufficient to fund our operations through the end of May 2025. Because expected revenues are not adequate to fund our planned expenditures and anticipated operating costs beyond such point, we are currently evaluating potential means of raising cash through future capital transactions and/or bridge loans. If we are unable to do so, we will be required to reduce our spending rate to align with expected revenue levels and cash reserves, although there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Accordingly, we will likely be required to raise additional cash through debt or equity transactions and/or bridge loans to continue our operations, and if we are unable to do so, we will be required to suspend a portion or all of our operations. We may not be able to secure financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all.

 

As a result of these factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 are issued. The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of $1.9 million consisted of a net loss of $2.6 million, partially offset by an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million and non-cash expenses of $0.6 million, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million and a change in fair value of royalties payable of $0.1 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Accordingly, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented.

 

The Company’s Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The information set forth below relates to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates. The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. 

 

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to business combinations, including the determination of the purchase price and related allocations to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, provisions for legal contingencies, income taxes, deferred income tax, asset valuation allowances, valuation of warrant liabilities, share based compensation and revenues. Our estimates are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.

 

We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

 

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets-Useful Lives

 

Intangible assets acquired from business combinations are initially measured at their estimated fair values and are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining useful life or carrying value of the amortizing intangible should be revised and adjusted, if necessary. Should the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss at that date.

 

 

                                                                   46

Stock-Based Compensation 

 

We calculate the cost of awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued to employees, members of our board of directors and nonemployee consultants using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model, or Black-Scholes model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate. The expected term of the options is the estimated period of time until exercise and was determined using the SEC’s safe harbor rules, using an average of vesting and contractual terms, as we did not have sufficient historical experience of similar awards. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatilities of certain “guideline” companies, as the Company does not have sufficient historical stock price data. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent term. The estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, adjusted for actual forfeitures at the time they occur.

 

Royalties Payable

 

We are obligated to pay royalties under various royalty agreements Old Cather had entered into. On January 9, 2023, prior to the consummation of the Merger, Old Catheter entered in an agreement with its Convertible Promissory Noteholders, which substantially consisted of amounts due to David A. Jenkins, previously Old Catheter's Chairman of the Board of Directors prior to the Merger, and, currently, the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, to forgive all accrued interest and future interest expense in exchange for a future royalty right. We will pay to the Noteholders a total royalty equal to approximately 12% of net sales of LockeT, commencing upon the first commercial sale, through December 31, 2035. 

 

In addition, Old Catheter had entered into an agreement with the inventor of LockeT in exchange for the assignment and all rights to LockeT. Pursuant to the agreement, we will pay a 5% royalty on net sales up to $1 million in royalties. After $1 million has been paid, and if, and only if, a U.S. patent is granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, then we will continue to pay a royalty at a rate of 2% of LockeT net sales, until total cumulative royalties of $10 million have been paid.

 

During 2006 and 2007, Old Catheter entered into two investment grant agreements with a non-profit foundation for the purpose of funding the initial development of Old Catheter's AMIGO System. The agreement calls for the payment of sales-based royalties to the foundation, upon successful commercialization of the AMIGO System. We are not currently selling the AMIGO System.

 

New Accounting Pronouncements

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. These amendments do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently reviewing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 

 

                                                                   47

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and for income taxes paid. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is required to adopt this standard prospectively in fiscal year 2025 for the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2025. The accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's related disclosures.

 

Effective January 1, 2023, repurchases are subject to a nondeductible excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 equal to 1.0% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, subject to certain limitations. There was no impact to our financial condition or results of operations in 2023 or for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as a result of the excise tax.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not applicable.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, with the participation of our Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2024. Our objective in designing our disclosure controls and procedures is that they provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, due to the existence of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.  As disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the reasons set forth therein, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer had previously concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In preparation of our financial statements for the period covered by this report, we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to our control environment that existed as of March 31, 2024, as described below. 

 

Specifically, we identified material weaknesses with respect to (1) the lack of segregation of duties, (2) the lack of designed and operating review controls with respect to oversight of the financial reporting process, (3) errors with respect to the review of work performed by service providers, (4) errors in connection with accounting for the royalty obligation acquired in the merger with Old Catheter, (5) use of an incorrect discount rate in calculating the fair value of the royalty obligation,  and (6) timing of revenue recognition.

 

 

                                                                   48

Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes that the Financial Statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly Report and in its Quarterly and Annual Reports filed during and with respect to the year ended December 31, 2023 fairly present, in all material respects, our balance sheets, statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented.

 

Remediation Plan

 

Management is in the process of developing a remediation plan and believes significant progress has been made, including the following remediation items:

 

1. Segregation of duties –All payroll items are now reviewed by our Interim Chief Financial Officer prior to processing the payroll. Invoices are entered by one clerk and checks cut by another, after approval from the Interim CFO authorizing which invoices to pay. Checks are signed by the Chief Executive Officer. Wires are entered by one clerk and approval is required by the Interim Chief Financial Officer. Addition of a permanent Chief Financial Officer would strength the reviews/controls already in place and a search is currently in process.

 

2. Lack of designed and operating review controls with respect to oversight of the financial reporting process – A third party contractor prepares the financial reports and they are reviewed and approved by management prior to inclusion in any filings. Addition of a permanent Chief Financial Officer will create an additional layer of review.

 

3. Errors with respect to the review of work performed by service providers – work performed by service providers is reviewed and any errors identified are sent back to service provider for resolution before being incorporated into the company’s financial reports.

 

4. Errors in connection with accounting for the royalty obligations acquired in the merger with Old Catheter – the first royalty calculations did not include the royalty for LockeT inventor. Any new contracts are now reviewed by the Interim Chief Financial Officer for any assets or liabilities that would need to be recorded.

 

5. Use of an incorrect discount rate in calculating the fair value of the royalty obligation – Calculations are reviewed by management to ensure inputs are reasonable prior to incorporating the calculations into the Company’s financial reports.

 

6. Timing of revenue recognition – Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer. We have implemented a tracking spreadsheet for all shipments which contains delivery date, and invoicing/recognition of revenue is then dated to match the delivery date. This is reviewed at month end by the Interim Chief Financial Officer to ensure revenue is recognized in the proper period.

 

The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate.  Additional anticipated remediation measures include continuing assessment of the need to expand the Company’s current accounting and financial reporting teams to include individuals with requisite experience to meet the requirements associated with the increasing operations of a publicly traded company, establishment of policies and procedures to ensure full review and sign offs with respect to the inputs sent to third-party service providers as well as the reports and documentation upon the completion of their work prior to any adjustments being made to the financial statements, establishment of  policies and procedures related to the review of all contracts the Company enters into to ensure any terms or conditions are evaluated for any accounting required or accounting treatment or disclosure, and establishment of policies and procedures to review the inputs to royalties payable and other fair value calculations as well as the outputs impacting the balance at each reporting period.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Except as noted above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 

 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

 

Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
