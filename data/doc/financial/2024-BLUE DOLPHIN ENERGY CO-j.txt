Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

  

(1) Organization

 

Company Overview

Blue Dolphin was formed in 1986 as a Delaware corporation.  The company is an independent downstream energy company operating in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.  Operations primarily consist of a light sweet-crude, 15,000-bpd crude distillation tower, and approximately 1.25 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity in Nixon, Texas.  Blue Dolphin trades on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol “BDCO.”

 

Assets are organized in two business segments: ‘refinery operations’ (owned by LE) and ‘tolling and terminaling services’ (owned by LRM and NPS). ‘Corporate and other’ includes Blue Dolphin subsidiaries BDPL (inactive pipeline and facilities assets), BDPC (inactive leasehold interests in oil and gas wells), and BDSC (administrative services).  See “Note (4)” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our business segments.

 

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” or “ours,” refer to Blue Dolphin, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole.

 

Jonathan Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, and an Affiliate together controlled 83% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report.  An Affiliate also operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, funds working capital requirements during periods of working capital deficits, guarantees certain of our third-party secured debt, and is a significant customer of our refined products.  Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries are currently parties to a variety of agreements with Affiliates. See “Note (3)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to Affiliate agreements, arrangements, and risks associated with working capital deficits.

 

Going Concern Assessment

Certain conditions and events were noted that initially caused management to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern.  These conditions and events include historical working capital deficits and significant current debt in default. We had positive working capital of $0.3 million at  March 31, 2024 compared to a working capital deficit of $6.1 million at  December 31, 2023, representing a $6.4 million improvement. Our significant current debt is primarily the result of bank debt to Veritex and GNCU being in default. Excluding accrued interest, the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $40.6 million and $39.4 million at at March 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023, respectively.  The $1.1 million increase in current debt between the periods primarily related to the Kissick Debt falling within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2024. 

 

Our current assets totaled $52.8 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $49.3 million at  December 31, 2023, representing a $3.5 million increase.  Our current liabilities totaled $52.5 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $55.4 million at  December 31, 2023, representing a $2.9 million decrease.  Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, our current liabilities totaled $12.0 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $16.0 million at  December 31, 2023, representing a $4.0 million decrease.  

 

Management believes that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they become due through the generation of cash flows from operations and liquidation of current working capital amounts for a reasonable period (defined as one year from the issuance of these financial statements).  To bolster working capital reserves, management continues efforts to restructure debt obligations and reduce cash requirements.  Management acknowledges that uncertainty remains related to future operating margins.  However, management has a reasonable expectation of Blue Dolphin's ability to generate adequate working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on our long-term debt.  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

Forbearance Agreements

Veritex Forbearance Agreements. Under the Veritex Forbearance Agreement, LE and LRM paid Veritex: (i) $4.3 million in past due principal and interest at the non-default rate (excluding late fees), (ii) $1.0 million into a payment reserve account, and (iii) $0.04 million in Veritex attorney fees. The Veritex Forbearance Agreement expired on September 30, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex First Amended Forbearance Agreement. The First Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on December 29, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement.  The Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29, 2024.  During each of these forbearance periods, Veritex agreed to forbear from testing borrowers’ compliance with financial covenants as specified in the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 and forbear from exercising its rights or remedies with respect to non-compliance with the financial covenants. 

 

Kissick Forbearance Agreement. Pursuant to the Kissick Forbearance Agreement, Kissick Noteholder agreed to forbear from exercising any of its rights and remedies related to existing defaults pertaining to payment violations under the Kissick Debt.  Under the terms of the Kissick Forbearance Agreement, LE agreed to make monthly principal and interest payments totaling $0.5 million beginning in April 2023, continuing on the first of each month through February 2025, with a final payment of $0.4 million to Kissick Noteholder on March 1, 2025. LE paid Kissick Noteholder $1.5 million and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of the filing date of this report, the Kissick Debt was in forbearance related to past defaults prior to April 2023.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

LEH Payment Agreement.  Pursuant to the LEH Payment Agreement, LEH agreed to forbear from exercising any of its rights and remedies related to existing defaults pertaining to payment violations under the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement.  Under the terms of the LEH Payment Agreement, BDPL agreed to make interest-only monthly payments approximating $0.05 million beginning in May 2023, continuing on the fifteenth of each month through April 2025. Beginning in May 2025, BDPL agreed to make principal and interest monthly payments approximating $0.4 million through April 2027. Interest will be incurred throughout the agreement term, including the interest-only payment period. BDPL paid LEH approximately $0.1 million and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of the filing date of this report, the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement was in forbearance related to past defaults prior to May 2023.

 

Defaults. As of March 31, 2024 and through the filing date of this report, we were in default under the NPS Term Loan Due 2031 due to covenant violations.  The Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29, 2024.  The LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 were in default due to covenant violations for the period March 30, 2024 through the filing date of this report. Defaults may permit lenders to declare the amounts owed under the related loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise their rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies under secured loan agreements that are in default could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations.  In such a case, the trading price of our Common Stock and the value of an investment in our Common Stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our Common Stock losing their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety.  If we are unable to manage this, we may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

 

Refining Margins

Our results of operations and liquidity are highly dependent upon the margins we receive for our refined products. The dollar per bbl commodity price difference between crude oil and condensate (input) and refined products (output) is the most significant driver of refining margins, and they have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. The general outlook for the oil and natural gas industry for 2024 remains unclear given uncertainties surrounding general macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, and COVID-19.

 

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $6.6 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $1.12 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $10.1 million, or $0.68 per share, decrease in net income between the periods resulted from less favorable refining margins on lower refinery throughput, production, and sales volumes. We cannot assure investors that refining margins will remain positive and demand will increase.

 

Working Capital Improvements

We had working capital of $0.3 million at  March 31, 2024 and a working capital deficit of $6.1 million at  December 31, 2023, representing a $6.4 million improvement.  Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had $40.9 million and $33.3 million in working capital at  March 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a $7.6 million increase. The significant increase in working capital between the periods was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable - related party and inventory. We continue to actively explore additional funding to refinance and restructure debt and further improve working capital.

 

Operating Risks

Successful execution of our business strategy depends on several critical factors, including having adequate working capital, favorable refining margins, and maintaining operation of the Nixon refinery.

 

  ● Working Capital. As noted above, we have historically had working capital deficits primarily due to having significant current

     debt. Sufficient working capital is necessary to meet contractual, operational, regulatory, and safety needs. Our short-term

     working capital needs are primarily related to (i) purchasing crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, (ii)

     reimbursing LEH for direct operating expenses and paying the LEH operating fee under the Third Amended and Restated Operating

     Agreement, (iii) servicing debt, (iv) maintaining and improving the Nixon facility through capital expenditures, and (v) meeting

     regulatory compliance requirements. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to the repayment of long-term debt

     obligations. To avoid business disruptions and manage cash flow, we optimize receivables and payables by prioritizing payments,

     optimize inventory levels based on demand, monitor discretionary spending, and carefully manage capital

     expenditures.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

  ● Refining Margins. Refining margins, which are affected by commodity prices and refined product demand, are volatile, and a

     reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital. Crude oil

     refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, we must maximize yields of higher value finished petroleum

     products and minimize costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the spread between these commodity prices decreases, our

     margins are negatively affected. Although an increase or decrease in the commodity price for crude oil and other feedstocks

     generally results in a similar increase or decrease in commodity prices for finished petroleum products, typically there is a

     time lag between the two. The effect of crude oil commodity price changes on our finished petroleum product commodity prices

     therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully the market adjusts to reflect these changes. Unfavorable margins may

     have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity. To remain competitive in a volatile commodity price

     environment, we adjust throughput and production based on market conditions and adjust our product slate based on commodities

     pricing.

 

  ● Nixon Refinery Operation. We maintain relationships with suppliers that source and repair key components of the Nixon refinery. We

     expect our suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of component products and, when components are sent out for repair, to timely

     deliver components. However, in some cases, increases in demand or supply chain disruptions have led to part and component

     constraints. We use several suppliers and monitor supplier financial viability to mitigate supply-based risks that could cause a

     business

     disruption.

 

General macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, and COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the extent to which these factors impact our working capital, commodity prices, refined product demand, supply chain, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and future prospects will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. We can provide no guarantees that: our business strategy will be successful, Affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs when we experience working capital deficits, we will meet regulatory requirements to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) and decommission offshore pipelines and platform assets, we can obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or margins on our refined products will be favorable. Further, if third parties exercise their rights and remedies under secured loan agreements that are in default, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.  If we are unable to manage this, we may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

 

  

(2)   Principles of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include Blue Dolphin and its subsidiaries, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim consolidated financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC under Article 10 of Regulation S-X and the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. In management’s opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, disclosures are adequate, and the presented information is not misleading.

 

The consolidated balance sheet as of  December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited financial statements at that date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, or for any other period.

 

Significant Accounting Policies

A summary of significant Blue Dolphin accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are representations of management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

 

Use of Estimates.  The nature of our business requires that we make estimates and assumptions in accordance with U.S.GAAP.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although commodity price volatility, recession and inflation, armed conflicts in the Middle East and Europe and associated sanctions on Russian crude products, and severe weather resulting from climate change have impacted these estimates and assumptions, we are continually working to mitigate future risks. However, the extent to which these factors may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.

 

We assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with information reasonably available to us as of March 31, 2024 and through the filing date of this report.  The accounting matters assessed included, but not limited to, our allowance for credit losses, inventory and related reserves, and the carrying value of long-lived assets, assessing Blue Dolphin's ability to continue as a going concern and evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash. Cash and cash equivalents represent liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash balances are maintained in depository and overnight investment accounts with financial institutions that, at times, may exceed insured deposit limits. Although management historically deemed this a normal business risk, options to limit risk are being evaluated given current capital, credit, and commodity markets and financial institution health.  Restricted cash, non-current portion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflected amounts held in a payment reserve account by Veritex as security for payments under the LE Term Loan Due 2034. In the event that banks in which we maintain our cash balances (including restricted cash) fail, there can be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would intervene.

 

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows:

 

                                                                               March 31,          December 31,    

                                                                                  2024                2023        

                                                                                       (in thousands)              

                                                                                                                  

  Cash and cash equivalents                                                $           11,123  $           18,713 

  Restricted cash, noncurrent                                                           1,000                   5 

                                                                           $           12,123  $           18,718 

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses.  Accounts receivable are presented net of any necessary allowance(s) for credit losses.  Receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. An allowance for credit losses is established, when necessary, based on prior experience and other factors which, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating bad debts.  Management assesses collectability of the customer’s account based on current aging status, collection history, and financial condition.  Based on a review of these factors, management establishes or adjusts the allowance for specific customers and the entire accounts receivable portfolio.  We had an allowance for credit losses of $0 and $0.06 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Financial Instruments.  Our financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value as it carries interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate.

 

Inventory. Inventory primarily consists of refined products, crude oil and condensate, and chemicals.  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined by the average cost method, and net realizable value determined based on estimated selling prices less associated delivery costs.  If the net realizable value of our refined products inventory declines to an amount less than our average cost, we record a write-down of inventory and an associated adjustment to cost of goods sold. See “Note (7)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to inventory.

 

Property and Equipment.

Refinery and Facilities. We typically make ongoing improvements to the Nixon facility based on operational needs, technological advances, and safety and regulatory requirements.  We capitalize additions to refinery and facilities assets, and we expense costs for repairs and maintenance as incurred.  We record refinery and facilities at cost less any adjustments for depreciation or impairment.  We adjust the asset and the related accumulated depreciation accounts for the refinery and facilities asset’s retirement and disposal, with the resulting gain or loss included in the consolidated statements of operations.  For financial reporting purposes, we compute refinery and facilities assets depreciation using the straight-line method with an estimated useful life of 25 years; we depreciate refinery and facilities assets when placed in service.  We did not record any impairment of our refinery and facilities assets for the periods presented.

 

Pipelines and Facilities. We record our pipelines and facilities at cost less any adjustments for depreciation or impairment.  We computed depreciation using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 22 years. Per FASB ASC guidance, we performed impairment testing of our pipeline and facilities assets in 2016. Upon completion of testing, we fully impaired our pipeline assets at December 31, 2016.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

Construction in Progress (CIP). CIP expenditures, including capitalized interest, relate to construction and refurbishment activities and equipment for the Nixon facility.  These expenditures are capitalized as incurred. Depreciation begins once the asset is placed in service.  See “Notes (8) and (11)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to refinery and facilities assets, oil and gas properties, pipelines and facilities assets, and CIP.

 

Leases.  We determine whether a contract or agreement is or contains a lease at inception. If the contract is or includes a lease and has a term greater than one year, we recognize a ROU asset and lease liability as of the commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. We determine the present value of the lease payments by using the implicit rate when readily determinable. If the implicit rate is not defined, we use the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments to present value. We adjust lease terms to include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options.

 

For operating leases, we record lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term; we record lease expenses in the appropriate line on the income statement based on the leased asset’s intended use.  For finance leases, we amortize lease payments for the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the leased asset’s useful life or the lease term; we record amortization expenses on the income statement in ‘depreciation and amortization expense;’ we record interest expense on the income statement in ‘interest and other expense.

’

 

Revenue Recognition. 

Refinery Operations Revenue. We recognize revenue from refined products sales when we meet our performance obligation to the customer.  We meet our performance obligation when the customer receives control of the product. The customer accepts control of the product when the product is lifted.  Under bill and hold arrangements, the customer takes control of the product when added to the customer’s bulk inventory as stored at the Nixon facility. We allocate a transaction price to each separately identifiable refined product load. 

 

We consider a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of a control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the refined product, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, our rights to payment, and transfer of legal title. In each case, the term between the sale and when payment is due is not significant.  We include incurred transportation, shipping, and handling costs in the cost of goods sold. We do not include excise and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities in revenue.

 

Tolling and Terminaling Revenue. Tolling and terminaling revenue represents fees under (i) terminal services agreements whereby a customer agrees to pay a certain fee per storage tank based on tank size over time for the storage of products and (ii) tolling agreements, whereby a customer agrees to pay a certain fee per gallon or barrel for throughput volumes moving through the naphtha stabilizer unit and a fixed monthly reservation fee for the use of the naphtha stabilizer unit.

 

We typically satisfy performance obligations for tolling and terminaling operations over time. We determine the transaction price at agreement inception based on the guaranteed minimum amount of revenue over the agreement term. We allocate the transaction price to the single performance obligation that exists under the agreement. We recognize revenue in the amount for which we have a right to invoice. Generally, payment terms do not exceed 30 days.

 

Revenue from storage tank customers may, from time to time, include fees for ancillary services, such as in-tank and tank-to-tank blending.  These services are considered optional to the customer.  The fixed cost under the customer’s storage tank agreement does not include ancillary services fees. We consider ancillary services as a separate performance obligation under the storage tank agreement. We satisfy the performance obligation and recognize the associated fee when we complete the requested service.

 

Deferred Revenue. Deferred revenue represents a liability related to a revenue-producing activity as of the balance sheet date.  We record unearned revenue, which usually consists of customer prepayments, when we receive the cash payment. Once we satisfy the performance obligation, we recognize revenue in conformity with GAAP.

 

Contract Balances. The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable and customer pre-payments and deposits (contract liabilities) on our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are billed as products are lifted and sold or upon signing of bulk sales contracts. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in a short-term liability. We sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These deposits are liquidated when revenue is recognized. 

 

Unearned Contract Renewal Income. We recognize deferred revenue from suppliers for upfront payments received but not yet earned as a reduction of cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the term of the supply contract.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)





 

Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes federal and state taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate  may be different than expected if the federal and state statutory rates were applied to income from continuing operations due to certain items that are deductible or included in income for tax purposes that are not deductible or included for financial statement purpose.

 

The benefit of an uncertain tax position is recognized in the financial statements if it meets a minimum recognition threshold. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to meet the more-likely-than-not criteria, the benefit recorded in the financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. At  December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no uncertain tax positions for which a reserve or liability was necessary.

 

Deferred Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we are unable to conclude that realization of the deferred income tax assets is more likely than not.

 

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. Additionally, we reassess our long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or group of assets. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or group of assets is recognized.  Management uses significant judgment in forecasting future operating results and projected cash flows.  If conditions or assumptions change, material impairment charges could be necessary.

 

Commodity price market volatility associated with general macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, and COVID-19 could affect the value of certain of our long-lived assets.   As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not record any impairment of our long-lived assets. However, impairment may be required in the future if external events or circumstances change or if internal conditions shift materially.

 

Asset Retirement Obligations. We record a liability for the discounted fair value of an ARO in the period incurred. We also capitalize the corresponding cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted towards its future value each period, and we depreciate the capitalized cost over the useful life of the related asset. We recognize a gain or loss if we settle the liability for an amount other than the amount recorded.

 

Refinery and Facilities. We believe we have no legal or contractual obligation to dismantle or remove the refinery and facilities assets. Further, we believe that these assets have indeterminate lives because we cannot reasonably estimate the dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire these assets.  Management will record an asset retirement obligation for these assets when a definitive obligation arises, and retirement dates are evident.

 

Pipeline and Facilities; Oil and Gas Properties. Management uses significant judgment to estimate future asset retirement costs for our pipelines, related facilities, and oil and gas properties. These costs relate to dismantling and disposing of certain physical assets, plugging and abandoning wells, and restoring land and sea beds. Factors considered include regulatory permitting requirements, asset structural integrity, water depth, third-party equipment availability, and mobilization/demobilization costs.  We review our assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis.  See “Note (11)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to AROs.

 

Computation of Earnings Per Share. We present basic and diluted EPS.  Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.  We calculate diluted EPS by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS includes the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares of common stock were converted to common stock that then shared in the entity’s earnings.  We do not currently have issued options, warrants, or similar instruments.  Convertible shares, if granted, are not included in the computation of earnings per share if anti-dilutive.  See “Note (14)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to EPS.

 

New Pronouncements Adopted

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not adopt any ASUs.

 

New Pronouncements Issued, Not Yet Effective

 

  ● ASU 2023-09 — Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). In December 2023, the FASB issued

     ASU 2023-09, requiring us to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide

     additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require us to disaggregate

     our income taxes paid disclosure by federal and state taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual

     jurisdictions. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 in the fourth quarter of 2025. ASU 2023-09 allows for adoption using either a

     prospective or retrospective transition

Forbearance and Defaults.

LEH Payment Agreement.  Pursuant to the LEH Payment Agreement, LEH agreed to forbear from exercising any of its rights and remedies related to existing defaults pertaining to payment violations under the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement.  Under the terms of the LEH Payment Agreement, BDPL agreed to make interest-only monthly payments approximating $0.05 million beginning in May 2023, continuing on the fifteenth of each month through April 2025. Beginning in May 2025, BDPL agreed to make principal and interest monthly payments approximating $0.4 million through April 2027. Interest will be incurred throughout the agreement term, including the interest-only payment period. BDPL paid LEH approximately $0.1 million and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of the filing date of this report, the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement was in forbearance related to past defaults.

 

Covenants, Guarantees and Security.

The BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that we consider usual and customary for a credit facility of this type.  Certain BDPL property serves as collateral under the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement.

 

See “Notes (1) and (10)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding defaults under our secured loan agreements and their potential effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

(4) Revenue and Segment Information

 

We have two reportable business segments: (i) refinery operations, which derives revenue from refined product sales, and (ii) tolling and terminaling, which derives revenue from storage tank rental fees, ancillary services fees (such as for in-tank blending) and tolling and reservation fees for use of the naphtha stabilizer at the Nixon refinery. ‘Corporate and other’ as presented in the segment information includes BDSC, BDPL, and BDPC.

 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue.  We present revenue in the table below under ‘Segment Information’ separated by business segment because management believes this presentation is beneficial to users of our financial information.

 

Receivables from Contracts with Customers.  We present accounts receivable from contracts with customers as accounts receivable, net on our consolidated balance sheets.

 

Contract Liabilities.  Our contract liabilities consist of unearned revenue from customers in the form of prepayments.  We include unearned revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  See “Note (9)” to our consolidated financial statements for more information related to unearned revenue.

 

Remaining Performance Obligations.  Most of our customer contracts are settled immediately and therefore have no remaining performance obligations.

(5) Concentration of Risk

 

Bank Accounts

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of risk consist primarily of cash, trade receivables and payables. We maintain cash balances at financial institutions in Houston, Texas. The FDIC insures certain financial products up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor.  At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash balances (including restricted cash) exceeded the FDIC insurance limit per depositor by $11.4 million and $18.2 million, respectively. Instability and volatility in the capital, credit, and commodity markets, as well as with financial institutions, could adversely affect our cash balances (including restricted cash) in excess of FDIC insurance limits per depositor. In the event that banks in which we maintain our cash balances (including restricted cash) fail, there can be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would intervene.

 

Key Supplier

Operation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. On  December 29, 2023, we entered a new crude supply agreement with MVP, effective  January 1, 2024. This agreement provides a firm source of light-sweet Eagle Ford crude oil to the Nixon facility under improved credit terms, and management believes that MVP can provide us with adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate for the foreseeable future.  Related to the crude supply agreement, MVP stores crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement. At March 31, 2024, accounts payable for crude oil and condensate was $1.3 million.

 

During 2023, we operated under a crude supply agreement with Tartan.  Tartan also stored crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement.  In a letter dated October 31, 2023, Tartan provided LE and NPS the required 60 days’ notice of its intention to terminate the crude supply agreement and terminal services agreement. The effective date of the termination was December 31, 2023.  During Q1 2023, the vast majority of our crude was sourced from Tartan under the crude supply agreement.  At March 31, 2023, accounts payable for crude oil and condensate was $0.

 

Our financial health has been materially and adversely affected by significant current debt, certain of which is in default, historical net losses, working capital deficits, and margin volatility. If we are required to obtain our crude oil and condensate without the benefit of a long-term crude supply agreement, our exposure to the risks associated with volatile crude oil prices  may increase, crude oil transportation costs could increase, and our liquidity  may be reduced. Similarly, if producers experience crude supply constraints and increased transportation costs, our crude acquisition costs  may rise, or we  may not receive sufficient amounts to meet our needs, which could result in refinery downtime and could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Customers

Significant Customers. We routinely assess the financial strength of our customers.  To date, we have not experienced significant write-downs in accounts receivable balances.  We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.

One of our significant customers is LEH, an Affiliate. The Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under the Amended and Restated Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and sells the jet fuel to the DLA under preferential pricing terms due to its HUBZone certification.  The jet fuel, which is stored at the Nixon Facility, is lifted by the Affiliate as needed.  For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Affiliate accounted for 30.7% and 30.3% of total revenue from operations, respectively.

 

Customer Concentration.  Our customer base consists of refined petroleum product wholesalers.  Economic changes similarly affect our customers positively or negatively, which impacts our overall exposure to credit risk. Economic changes include uncertainties related to commodity price volatility, recession and inflation, and armed conflicts in the Middle East and Europe and associated sanctions on Russian crude products.  Historically, we have had no significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.

 

Refined Product Sales

We sell our products primarily in the U.S. within PADD 3.  Occasionally we sell refined products to customers that export to other countries, such as naphtha and distillate to Mexico.  Total refined product sales by distillation (from light to heavy) for the periods indicated consisted of the following:

The Veritex Forbearance Agreement expired on September 30, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex First Amended Forbearance Agreement. The First Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on December 29, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement.  The Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29, 2024.  During each of these forbearance periods, Veritex agreed to forbear from testing borrowers’ compliance with financial covenants as specified in the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 and forbear from exercising its rights or remedies with respect to non-compliance with the financial covenants.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

Defaults. As of March 31, 2024 and through the filing date of this report, we were in default under the NPS Term Loan Due 2031 due to covenant violations.  We were also in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034; the Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29, 2024. Defaults may permit lenders to declare the amounts owed under the related loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise their rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies under secured loan agreements that are in default could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations.  In such a case, the trading price of our Common Stock and the value of an investment in our Common Stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our Common Stock losing their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety.

 

We can provide no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under secured loan agreements that are in default, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) LE, LRM, NPS, or BDPL will be able to refinance or restructure the debt, and/or (iii) third parties will provide future forbearances or default waivers, particularly if the banks with whom we have relationships fail. If one or more banks fail, we could be exposed to additional events of default (if not cured or waived) under existing secured loan agreements. Defaults under our secured loan agreements and any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies related to such defaults may have a material adverse effect on our business, the trading price of our Common Stock, and on the value of an investment in our Common Stock, and holders of our Common Stock could lose their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety. If the debt associated with secured loan agreements is accelerated and we are unable to refinance or restructure the debt or obtain default waivers, we may have to consider other options, including selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs, reducing cash requirements, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating. See “Notes (1) and (3)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding defaults under our secured loan agreements and their potential effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

(11) AROs

 

Refinery and Facilities

Management has concluded that there is no legal or contractual obligation to dismantle or remove refinery and facilities assets. Management believes that refinery and facilities assets have indeterminate lives under FASB ASC guidance for estimating AROs because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire these assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a legal or contractual obligation to dismantle or remove refinery and facilities assets arises and a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of these assets, we will estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using present value techniques.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

Pipelines and Facilities and Oil and Gas Properties

We have AROs associated with decommissioning our pipelines and facilities assets, as well as plugging and abandoning our oil and gas properties.  We recorded a discounted liability for the fair value of an ARO with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time the asset was installed or placed in service, and we depreciated the amount added to property and equipment. From time to time we record an increase in liability or an impairment due to changes in estimates or the timing of decommissioning the assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 we did not record an increase in liability or an impairment related to our pipeline and facilities assets.

 

Because our pipelines and facilities assets have been inactive for an extended period, BOEM mandated that they be decommissioned. In October 2023, management met with BSEE to discuss BDPL’s path forward for meeting decommissioning requirements.  Management worked with a consultant to develop a decommissioning plan, and BDPL is following the plan. Separately, management is exploring alternatives to reactivate the assets under a potential alternate Rights-of-Use and Easement (RUE).  Based on updated estimates for pipeline decommissioning, platform removal, and associated costs, as well as resource availability and projected weather conditions, we believe decommissioning and remediation of all associated INCs will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2024.  However, BDPL’s work plan does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to comply with BSEE’s mandate or of BSEE’s authority to impose financial penalties. Further, there can be no assurance that BDPL will be able to complete the anticipated work or predict the outcome of BSEE INCs. Accordingly, we did not record a liability related to potential penalties on our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BDPL maintained $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets, which amount does not include potential penalties.

 

Due to BDPL’s failure to complete decommissioning of the offshore pipeline and platform assets and remedy associated INCs within the timeframe mandated by BSEE, BDPL could be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failing to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL’s operator designation, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.  On January 26, 2024, BSEE assessed a civil penalty of $0.2 million against BDPL for failure to complete annual platform inspections in a timely manner.  We recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of  March 31, 2024.  Although BDPL filed an appeal to the civil penalty on  March 25, 2024, BDPL filed a motion to withdraw the appeal on April 17, 2024.  BDPL paid the civil penalty related to platform inspections on April 19, 2024.

 

ARO liability as of the dates indicated was as follows:

(12) Lease Obligations

 

Lease Obligations

Office Lease.  We maintain our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas.  In May 2023, BDSC signed a 12-month extension to its existing operating lease. The extended term commenced on September 1, 2023 and expires on August 31, 2024. Under the amended agreement, the annual rent was reduced from $31.00 per square foot to $30.00 per square foot, resulting in a monthly base rental amount of $0.02 million.  Management is currently exploring leasing options.

 

An Affiliate, LEH, subleases a portion of the Houston office space. BDSC received sublease income from LEH totaling $0.01 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. See “Note (3)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to the Affiliate sub-lease.

 

Tank Lease. LE leases tanks from Ingleside under the LE Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement. Lease expense associated with the LE Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement totaled $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Due to its one-year term, the lease is being treated as short term.  As a result, the lease was not recorded on our balance sheet. See “Note (3)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to the LE Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement.

(13) Income Taxes

 

The Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was enacted into law in August 2022.  The IRA imposes a 15% alternative minimum tax on corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income during the most recently completed three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion. We do not fall within the category of “applicable corporations” and are therefore exempt from payment of an alternative minimum tax.

Deferred Income Taxes

Balances for deferred income tax represent the effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts and the actual income tax basis of our assets and liabilities; the balances also reflect NOL carryforwards. We record the balances based on tax rates we expect to be in effect when paid. NOL carryforwards and deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce future taxable income.

 

Valuation Allowance.  As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets.  This assessment (of whether there is more than a 50% probability that our deferred tax asset is realizable) depends on the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of any NOL carryforwards. During the year ended  December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance was reduced to zero based upon the expected utilization of the net deferred tax asset as a result of positive evidence that was evaluated, including recent earnings history and expectations for future taxable income.

 

At   March 31, 2024, there were no uncertain tax positions for which a reserve or liability was necessary. 

 

NOL Carryforwards

Under IRC Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on using pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an “ownership change” occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of stockholders who own more than 5% (after applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than fifty percent [50% over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years)]. Based on the tax rule, ownership changes occurred in 2005 and 2012. The 2005 ownership change related to a series of private placements; the 2012 ownership change related to a reverse acquisition.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

The 2005 and 2012 ownership changes limit the use of pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. The annual use limitation generally equals the value of the common stock, on an aggregate basis, when the ownership change occurred multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate. The 2012 ownership change will subject approximately $16.3 million in NOL carryforwards generated before the ownership change to an annual use limitation of approximately $0.6 million per year. We  may use any unused portions of the limitation in subsequent years. Because of the yearly restriction, approximately $6.7 million in NOL carryforwards generated before the 2012 ownership change will expire unused and are excluded in the NOL carryforward presented below. NOL carryforwards generated after the 2012 ownership change but before 2018 are not subject to an annual use limitation; we can use these NOL carryforwards for 20 years in addition to NOL carryforward amounts generated before the ownership change. NOL carryforwards generated beginning in 2018  may only be used to offset 80% of taxable income and are carried forward indefinitely.

 

NOL Carryforwards Available for Use. NOL carryforwards that remained available for future use for the periods indicated were as follow (amounts shown are net of NOLs that will expire unused because of the IRC Section 382 limitation):

Diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was the same as basic EPS as there were no stock options or other dilutive instruments outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.

 

Shareholders are entitled to receive such dividends as  may be declared by our Board out of funds legally available for such purpose. However, no dividend  may be declared or paid unless after-tax profit was made in the preceding fiscal year, we comply with covenants in our secured loan agreements, we are current on all required debt payments, and we have received prior written concurrence from certain lenders.

(15) Commitments and Contingencies

 

Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement

See “Note (3)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to operation and management of all Blue Dolphin assets by an Affiliate under the Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement.

 

Offshore Pipelines and Platform Requirements

BDPL has pipelines and platform assets subject to BSEE’s idle iron regulations.  Idle iron regulations require lessees and rights-of-way holders to permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when they are no longer useful for operations.  Until such structures are abandoned or removed, lessees and rights-of-way holders are required to inspect and maintain the assets in accordance with regulatory requirements.

 

Platform Inspections.  We are required by BSEE to perform annual structural inspections of our offshore platform, as well as to perform monthly platform checks of navigational aids, fog horns, and lifesaving equipment. In  March 2023, BSEE issued BDPL an INC for failing to perform the required 2021 and 2022 structural surveys for the GA-288C platform and for failing to provide BSEE with such survey results. In  April 2023, BSEE granted BDPL an extension for completing the required platform inspection until  May 30, 2023.  Although BDPL requested a second extension, BSEE denied BDPL’s request. BDPL completed the platform inspection on  August 26, 2023 and submitted the survey report to BSEE on  September 6, 2023. Because BDPL failed to comply with the INC within the allotted timeframe, BSEE proposed an administrative civil penalty of approximately $0.2 million on  October 24, 2023.  The proposed administrative civil penalty was finalized on  January 26, 2024, for $0.2 million.  We recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of  March 31, 2024.  Although BDPL filed an appeal to the civil penalty on  March 25, 2024, BDPL filed a motion to withdraw the appeal on April 17, 2024.  BDPL paid the civil penalty related to platform inspections on April 19, 2024.

 

Decommissioning Obligations.  Because our pipelines and facilities assets have been inactive for an extended period, BOEM mandated that they be decommissioned. In  October 2023, management met BSEE to discuss BDPL’s path forward for meeting decommissioning requirements. Management worked with a consultant to develop a decommissioning plan, and BDPL submitted its decommissioning plan to the agency in  November 2023. Although the decommissioning of these assets was delayed due to cash constraints associated with historical net losses and the impact of COVID-19, a significant portion of the decommissioning project was completed from late  December 2023 to mid-  February 2024. Based on updated estimates for pipeline decommissioning, platform removal, and associated costs, as well as resource availability and projected weather conditions, we believe decommissioning and remediation of all associated INCs will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2024.  However, BDPL’s work plan does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to comply with BSEE’s mandate or BSEE’s authority to impose financial penalties. Further, there can be no assurance that BDPL can complete anticipated work or predict the outcome of BSEE INCs.  Accordingly, we did not record a liability related to potential penalties on our consolidated balance sheets as of  March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Due to BDPL’s failure to comply with BSEE requirements, BDPL could still be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failing to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL’s operator designation, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.  At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BDPL maintained $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets, which amount does not include potential penalties.

 

Defaults Under Secured Loan Agreements with Third Parties and Related Parties

See “Notes (1), (3), and (10)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to defaults under our secured and unsecured debt agreements.

 

Financing Agreements and Guarantees

Indebtedness.  See “Notes (1), (3), and (10)” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to Affiliate and third-party indebtedness and defaults thereto.

 

Guarantees.  Affiliates provided guarantees on certain debt of Blue Dolphin and its subsidiaries.  The maximum amount of any guarantee is equal to the principal amount and accrued interest, which amounts are reduced as payments are made.  See “Notes (1), (3), and (10)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to Affiliate and third-party guarantees associated with indebtedness and defaults thereto.

 

Health, Safety and Environmental Matters

The operations of certain Blue Dolphin subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum products and hazardous substances; the emission and discharge of materials into the environment; waste management; characteristics and composition of jet fuel and other products; and the monitoring, reporting and control of air emissions. These operations also require numerous permits and authorizations under various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Failing to obtain and comply with these permits or environmental, health, or safety laws could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions, or a revocation of our permits.

Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal matters incidental to the routine operation of our business, such as mechanic’s liens and contract-related disputes. We  may also become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory, and other matters. Large, sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties  may be sought from us in some matters, which  may require years to resolve. Although we cannot provide assurance, we believe that an adverse resolution of the matters described below would not have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or consolidated results of operations.

 

Resolved Matters.

Pilot Dispute Related to Terminal Services Agreement. Effective  May 9, 2019, NPS and Pilot entered into a Terminal Services Agreement, pursuant to which NPS agreed to store jet fuel purchased by Pilot at the Nixon facility. On  August 25, 2022, Pilot provided the 60-day notice of its intent to terminate the Terminal Services Agreement, which became effective on  October 24, 2022. As of the Terminal Services Agreement termination date, approximately 185,000 bbls of Pilot’s jet fuel remained at the Nixon facility.

 

On  October 28, 2022, Pilot commenced an action and application for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) against NPS in Harris County District Court (the “Texas Action”). After a hearing on the application on  October 28, 2022, Pilot’s application for the TRO was denied the same day.  On  December 2, 2022, NPS filed its answer in the Texas Action. On  December 6, 2022, NPS provided notice under Section 7.206(a) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code ("TBCC") of its intent to sell the remaining inventory of Pilot’s jet fuel at the Nixon facility by  January 7, 2023. After negotiations, NPS agreed to forbear from exercising its remedies under the TBCC while the parties explored a potential dispute compromise pursuant to the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, with a forbearance period terminating on  February 28, 2023. As part of the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, Pilot paid NPS approximately $1.5 million in  January 2023. 

 

On  March 31, 2023, NPS and Pilot executed the Pilot Forbearance Amendment, extending the forbearance period and all deadlines in the unresolved Texas Action to  June 15, 2023.  As part of the Pilot Forbearance Amendment, Pilot paid NPS approximately $1.1 million and $0.2 million in  April and  June 2023, respectively. The parties also negotiated the sale of all 185,000 bbls of stored jet fuel in  April 2023. On  June 16, 2023, following the expiration of the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, the parties agreed to extend the deadline for responses to outstanding discovery requests in the Texas Action to  August 31, 2023. On  August 28, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion to stay this case in anticipation of planned mediation in  December 2023 to settle all outstanding disputes.

 

Pilot Settlement Agreement.  A confidential Settlement Agreement by and among LEH, NPS, LE, LRM, Lazarus San Antonio Refinery, LLC, and Blue Dolphin (together the "Lazarus Entities"), on the one hand, and Pilot, Starlight Relatively Holdings LLC, Starlight Relativity Acquisition Company LLC, Tartan, The San Antonio Refinery LLC, and Falls City Terminal LP (together, the "Pilot Entities"), on the other hand, was executed on  December 29, 2023.  Among other matters addressed, NPS's contract-related dispute related to set-off payments and LRM’s contracted-related dispute involving a revenue-sharing arrangement for storing and selling crude oil with Pilot and Tartan, respectively, were fully resolved, and the parties agreed to mutually release all claims against each other.  Further, Pilot and NPS agreed to take such actions as necessary to dismiss the Texas Action.  For the avoidance of doubt, all contractual agreements between the Lazarus Entities and Pilot Entities were terminated.

 

OSHA Settlement Agreement. In  September 2022, we entered into an Informal Settlement Agreement with OSHA related to process safety management violations at the Nixon refinery. Under the agreement, we paid penalties totaling $0.05 million in  November 2022. We remediated a significant portion of identified violations before  December 31, 2022. We remediated the remaining violations on a progressive schedule by  April 2023.

 

Unresolved Matters.

BOEM Supplemental Pipeline Bonds. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator’s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the statutory bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning pipelines and platforms at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 

Historically, BDPL maintained $0.9 million in pipeline bonds with BOEM to decommission its trunk pipeline offshore in federal waters.  In  March 2018, BOEM ordered BDPL to provide additional financial assurance totaling approximately $4.8 million for five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way, an increase of approximately $3.9 million.  In  June 2018, BOEM issued BDPL INCs for each right-of-way that failed to comply. BDPL appealed the INCs to the IBLA.  Although the IBLA granted multiple extension requests, the Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior indicated that BOEM would not consent to further extensions. The solicitor’s office signaled that BDPL’s adherence to decommissioning its offshore pipelines and platform would likely help in future discussions with BOEM related to the INCs. Fulfilling abandonment obligations related to the subject assets will significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of supplemental pipeline bonds required by BOEM, which  may serve to partially or fully resolve the INCs.

 

BDPL’s pending appeal of the BOEM INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance or of BOEM’s authority to impose financial penalties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet additional supplemental pipeline bond requirements. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional supplemental pipeline bonds or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We cannot predict the outcome of the supplemental pipeline bond INCs.  Accordingly, we did not record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of  March 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023.  At both  March 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in pipeline rights-of-way surety bonds issued to BOEM through RLI. However, as noted below, RLI desires to reduce its risk profile related to BDPL's bonds.  Of the pipeline rights-of-way bonds, $0.7 million was credit-backed and $0.2 million was cash-backed.

 

RLI Surety Bonds.   Blue Dolphin currently has several surety bonds through RLI as required by different regulatory agencies, including BOEM and the Railroad Commission of Texas. The bonds total approximately $1.25 million in the aggregate, of which $0.2 million is collateralized in cash. In  June,  July, and  December 2023, RLI demanded Blue Dolphin provide additional cash collateral or a letter of credit totaling approximately $1.0 million or provide bond exonerations and replacement bonds.  Although Blue Dolphin received a proposal from another surety to replace the RLI bonds at a 50% collateral requirement, management was hopeful Blue Dolphin and RLI could reach an understanding whereby the existing bonds could be maintained until BDPL completed decommissioning of the subject assets. Abandonment of BDPL’s offshore pipeline and platform assets will eliminate the need for all BOEM supplemental pipeline bonds, reducing the amount of surety bonds held by RLI from $1.25 million to $0.25 million.  On  February 19, 2024, RLI filed suit against Blue Dolphin, BDPL, and BDEX seeking an injunction for the payment of approximately $1.0 million of additional collateral for the bonds. BDPL filed its answer to RLI's lawsuit on April 23, 2024 denying RLI's claims.

 

TCEQ Proposed Agreed Order. In  October 2021, LRM received a proposed agreed order from the TCEQ for alleged solid and hazardous waste violations discovered during an investigation from  January to  March 2020.  The proposed agreed order assessed an administrative penalty of $0.4 million and identified actions needed to correct the alleged violations. In  September 2023, TCEQ presented its final penalty offer of $0.35 million, which LRM accepted. Although LRM believes the penalty matter is resolved, LRM expects to continue working with TCEQ to remediate certain open items fully. At   March 31, 2024, we accrued $0.4 million on our balance sheet within accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to this matter.

 

BSEE Civil Penalties. We are required by BSEE to perform annual structural inspections of our offshore platform, as well as to perform monthly platform checks of navigational aids, fog horns, and lifesaving equipment. In  March 2023, BSEE issued BDPL an INC for failing to perform the required 2021 and 2022 structural surveys for the GA- 288C platform and for failing to provide BSEE with such survey results. In  April 2023, BSEE granted BDPL an extension for completing the required platform inspection until  May 30, 2023.  Although BDPL requested a second extension, BSEE denied BDPL’s request.  BDPL completed the platform inspection on  August 26, 2023 and submitted the survey report to BSEE on  September 6, 2023. Because BDPL failed to comply with the INC within the allotted timeframe, BSEE proposed an administrative civil penalty of approximately $0.2 million on  October 24, 2023.  The proposed administrative civil penalty was finalized on  January 26, 2024, for $0.2 million.  We recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of  March 31, 2024.  Although BDPL filed an appeal to the civil penalty on  March 25, 2024, BDPL filed a motion to withdraw the appeal on April 17, 2024.  BDPL paid the civil penalty related to platform inspections on April 19, 2024.

 

On April 26, 2024, BDPL received a civil penalty advisory letter from BSEE of the same date related to INCs issued by the agency in September 2023.  The letter indicates that the agency is reviewing the INCS, which relate to BDPL's offshore assets in federal waters.  BSEE will provide BDPL information related to its review within 90 days from the date of its letter.

 

Defaults under Secured Loan Agreements. We are currently in default under certain secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties. See “Notes (1), (3), and (10)” for additional disclosures related to third-party and related-party debt, default on such debt, and the potential effects of such defaults on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If third parties exercise their rights and remedies due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following discussion and analysis is management’s perspective of our current financial condition and results of operations, as well as significant trends that may affect future performance.  All statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain.  See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.  You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report, as well as with the business strategy, risk factors, and financial statements and related notes included thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Overview and Outlook

 

Company Overview

Blue Dolphin is an independent downstream energy company operating in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.  Our subsidiaries operate a light sweet-crude, 15,000-bpd crude distillation tower with more than 1.25 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity in Nixon, Texas.  Our assets are primarily organized in two segments: refinery operations (owned by LE) and tolling and terminaling services (owned by LRM and NPS).  Subsidiaries that are reflected in corporate and other include BDPL (inactive pipeline assets), BDPC (inactive leasehold interests in oil and gas wells), and BDSC (administrative services). Blue Dolphin was formed in 1986 as a Delaware corporation and is traded on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol “BDCO”.

 

Jonathan Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, and an Affiliate together controlled 83% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report.  An Affiliate also operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, funds working capital requirements during periods of working capital deficits, guarantees certain of our third-party secured debt, and is a significant customer of our refined products.  Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries are currently parties to a variety of agreements with Affiliates.  See “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements– Note (3)” for additional disclosures related to Affiliate agreements, arrangements, and risks associated with working capital deficits.

 

Going Concern Assessment

Certain conditions and events were noted that initially caused management to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern.  These conditions and events include historical working capital deficits and significant current debt in default. We had positive working capital of $0.3 million at March 31, 2024 compared to a working capital deficit of $6.1 million at December 31, 2023, representing a $6.4 million improvement. Our significant current debt is primarily the result of bank debt to Veritex and GNCU being in default. Excluding accrued interest, the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $40.6 million and $39.4 million at at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  The $1.1 million increase in current debt between the periods primarily related to the Kissick Debt falling within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2024. 

 

Our current assets totaled $52.8 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $49.3 million at December 31, 2023, representing a $3.5 million increase.  Our current liabilities totaled $52.5 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $55.4 million at December 31, 2023, representing a $2.9 million decrease.  Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, our current liabilities totaled $12.0 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $16.0 million at December 31, 2023, representing a $4.0 million decrease.  

 

Management believes that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they become due through the generation of cash flows from operations and liquidation of current working capital amounts for a reasonable period (defined as one year from the issuance of these financial statements).  To bolster working capital reserves, management continues efforts to restructure debt obligations and reduce cash requirements.  Management acknowledges that uncertainty remains related to future operating margins.  However, management has a reasonable expectation of Blue Dolphin's ability to generate adequate working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on our long-term debt.  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

Business Operations Update

During the first quarter of 2024, oil and gas commodity prices trended downward compared to the first quarter of 2023. Less favorable refining margins on lower refinery throughput, production, and sales volumes contributed to Blue Dolphin reporting net income of $6.6 million, or $0.44 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (“Q1 2024”) compared to the same period a year earlier. We reported net income of $16.8 million, or $1.12 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (“Q12023”). Our full operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 including operating results by segment, can be found within ‘—Results of Operations.’

 

We used cash flow from operations of $6.3 million for Q1 2024. The use in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a build in inventory in preparation for an upcoming turnaround.  At March 31, 2024, we had approximately $11.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found within ‘—Liquidity and Capital Resources.’

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

General Trends and Outlook

Uncertainties remain surrounding general macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, COVID-19, and the extent to which these factors may impact working capital, commodity prices, refined product demand, our supply chain, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and future prospects will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence. We can provide no guarantees that: our business strategy will be successful, Affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs when we experience working capital deficits, we will meet regulatory requirements to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) and decommission offshore pipelines and platform assets, we can obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or margins on our refined products will be favorable. Further, if third parties exercise their rights and remedies under secured loan agreements that are in default, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

 

Liquidity and Access to Capital Markets

We continue to actively explore additional funding to refinance and restructure debt and further improve working capital. During 2023, we entered into the Veritex First Amended Forbearance Agreement, Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement (which has expired), Kissick Forbearance Agreement, and LEH Payment Agreement.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, or refinance existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or restructure debt, certain of which is currently in default, or forbear or waive defaults and lenders exercise their rights with respect to the debt, we may not, in the short term, be able to purchase crude oil and condensate or meet debt payment obligations. In the long term, we may not be able to manage business disruptions, such as those experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, or execute our business strategy. We may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

 

Changes in Regulations

Our operations and the operations of our customers have been, and will continue to be, affected by political developments and federal, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations that are increasing in number and becoming more stringent and complex. These laws and regulations include, among other things, permitting requirements, environmental protection measures such as limitations on methane and other greenhouse gas emissions, and renewable fuels standards. The number and scope of the regulations with which we and our customers must comply has a meaningful impact on our and their businesses, and new or revised regulations, reinterpretations of existing regulations, and permitting delays or denials could adversely affect the profitability of our assets.

 

Business Strategy and Accomplishments

Our primary business objectives are to improve our financial profile and refining margins by executing the below strategies, modified as necessary, to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances:

 

                                

Optimize Existing Asset Base   ●   Maintain safe operations and enhance health, safety, and environmental systems. 

                               ●   Plan and manage turnarounds and downtime.

                                

                                

Improve Operational            ●   Reduce or streamline variable costs incurred in production. 

 Efficiencies

                               ●   Increase throughput capacity and optimize product slate. 

                               ●   Increase tolling and terminaling revenue.

                                

                                

Seize Market Opportunities     ●   Leverage existing infrastructure to engage in renewable energy projects. 

                               ●   Take advantage of market opportunities as they arise.

                                

 

Successful execution of our business strategy depends on multiple factors.  These factors include (i) having adequate working capital to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements, (ii) maintaining safe and reliable operations at the Nixon facility, (iii) meeting contractual obligations, (iv) having favorable margins on refined products, and (v) collaborating with new partners to develop and finance clean energy projects.  Our business strategy involves risks.  Accordingly, we cannot assure investors that our plans will be successful.  If we are unsuccessful, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs, or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock and the value of an investment in our common stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our common stock losing their investment in our common stock in its entirety.

 

Optimize Existing Asset Base

In January 2024 the Nixon facility was down for 3 days due to frigid temperatures. Following this event, management completed the installation of additional anti-icing chemical storage at the plant and is working on further improvements to protect the facility from severe cold weather. In anticipation of the shift to warm weather conditions, management is also making improvements to the facility to reduce heat-related injuries, including the planned installation of a 'cool down room' for personnel, contractors, and drivers.  Throughout 2024 we will continue to focus on improvements in day-to-day plant operations and identifying safety and mechanical process improvements to optimize plant operations, particularly considering extreme heat in Texas.

 

Improve Operational Efficiencies

During Q1 2024, management progressed with upgrading the Nixon facility's terminal management software.  Once complete, key elements of the plant's terminal loading functions will be automated, improving order management, bills of lading delivery, and reporting.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

Seize Market Opportunities

In 2021, we announced plans to leverage our existing infrastructure to establish adjacent lines of business, capture growing market opportunities, and capitalize on renewable energy growth. Rising demand for renewable energy is attributable to various factors, including growing public support, U.S. governmental actions to increase energy independence, and environmental concerns related to climate change. Throughout 2023, management had meaningful discussions with potential commercial partners and these efforts continue in 2024. Reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties, or other assessments on renewable energy projects, could result in, among other things, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects and us abandoning the development of renewable energy projects.

Crude Oil and Condensate Supply

Operation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. On December 29, 2023, we entered a new crude supply agreement with MVP, effective January 1, 2024. This agreement provides a firm source of light-sweet Eagle Ford crude oil to the Nixon facility under improved credit terms, and management believes that MVP can provide us with adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate for the foreseeable future.  Related to the crude supply agreement, MVP stores crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement. At March 31, 2024, accounts payable for crude oil and condensate was $1.3 million.

 

During 2023, we operated under a crude supply agreement with Tartan.  Tartan also stored crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement.  In a letter dated October 31, 2023, Tartan provided LE and NPS the required 60 days’ notice of its intention to terminate the crude supply agreement and terminal services agreement. The effective date of the termination was December 31, 2023.  During Q1 2023, the vast majority of our crude was sourced from Tartan under the crude supply agreement.  At March 31, 2023, accounts payable for crude oil and condensate was $0.

 

Our financial health has been materially and adversely affected by significant current debt, certain of which is in default, historical net losses, working capital deficits, and margin volatility. If we are required to obtain our crude oil and condensate without the benefit of a long-term crude supply agreement, our exposure to the risks associated with volatile crude oil prices may increase, crude oil transportation costs could increase, and our liquidity may be reduced. Similarly, if producers experience crude supply constraints and increased transportation costs, our crude acquisition costs may rise, or we may not receive sufficient amounts to meet our needs, which could result in refinery downtime and could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  If we are unable to manage this, we may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

 

Products and Markets

Our market is the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which is represented by the EIA as Petroleum Administration for PADD 3.  We sell our products primarily in the U.S. within PADD 3.  Occasionally, we sell refined products to customers that export to other countries, such as naphtha and distillate to Mexico.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

The Nixon refinery’s product slate is adjusted based on market demand. We currently produce a single finished product – jet fuel – and several intermediate products, including naphtha, HOBM, and AGO.  An Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under the Amended and Restated Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and sells the jet fuel to the DLA under preferential pricing terms due to the Affiliate's HUBZone certification.  The product sales agreement with the Affiliate has a one-year term with automatic renewals.  Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing.

 

Customers. Customers for our refined products include distributors, wholesalers, and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston – San Antonio – Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts in place with most of our customers, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms. Certain of our contracts require our customers to prepay and us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation on a forward-looking basis, which could result in higher or lower relative prices on future sales of our refined products.

 

Competition. Most of our competitors are larger than us and are engaged on a national or international level in many segments of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, gathering and transportation, and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined products slate because of changing commodity prices, market demand, and refinery operating costs.

 

Safety and Downtime. We operate the refinery in a manner that is materially consistent with industry safety practices and standards. EPA, OSHA, and comparable state and local regulatory agencies provide oversight for personnel safety, process safety management, and risk management to prevent or minimize the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Our storage tanks are equipped with leak detection devices. We also have response and control plans in place for spill prevention and emergencies.

 

The Nixon refinery periodically undergoes planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. We typically complete a planned turnaround annually to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. However, the timing of planned turnarounds is adjusted to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Occasionally, unplanned shutdowns occur. Unplanned downtime can occur for a variety of reasons; however, common reasons for unplanned downtime include repair/replacement of disabled equipment, crude deficiencies associated with cash constraints, high temperatures, and power outages.

 

We are particularly vulnerable to operation disruptions because all our refining operations occur at a single facility. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime results in lost margin opportunity, reduced refined products inventory, and potential increased maintenance expense, all of which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.

 

Midstream Operations

Our tolling and terminaling segment consists of the following assets and operations:

Products and Customers. The Nixon facility’s petroleum storage tanks and infrastructure are primarily suited for crude oil and condensate and refined products, such as naphtha, jet fuel, diesel, and fuel oil.  Our storage customers are typically from the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston – San Antonio – Dallas/Fort Worth area).  Shipments are received and redelivered from the Nixon facility via third party trucks.  Contract terms range from month-to-month to three years.

 

Operations Safety. Our midstream operations are operated in a manner materially consistent with industry safe practices and standards.  These operations are subject to OSHA regulations and comparable state and local regulators. Storage tanks used for terminal operations are designed for crude oil and condensate and refined products, and most are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our terminal operations have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies.

Inactive Operations

We own other pipeline and facilities assets and have leasehold interests in oil and gas properties.  These assets are inactive.  We account for these inactive operations in ‘corporate and other.’  Our pipeline assets have been fully impaired since 2016 and our oil and gas leasehold interests have been fully impaired since 2011. Our pipeline assets and oil and gas leasehold interests had no revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.  See “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements – Note (15)” related to pipelines and platform decommissioning requirements and related risks.

Results of Operations

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our consolidated financial results of operations is presented below and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements in “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements.” The financial statements, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but they should not serve as the only criteria for predicting future performance.

 

Major Influences on Results of Operations. Our results of operations and liquidity are highly dependent upon the margins that we receive for our refined products. The dollar per bbl commodity price difference between crude oil and condensate (input) and refined products (output) is the most significant driver of refining margins, and they have historically been subject to wide fluctuations.  When the spread between these commodity prices decreases, our margins are negatively affected. To improve margins, we must maximize yields of higher-value finished petroleum products and minimize costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. Although an increase or decrease in the commodity price for crude oil and other feedstocks generally result in a similar increase or decrease in commodity prices for finished petroleum products, typically there is a time lag between the two. The effect of crude oil commodity price changes on our finished petroleum product commodity prices therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully the market adjusts to reflect these changes.  Unfavorable margins may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.

 

The general outlook for the oil and natural gas industry for the remainder of  2024 remains unclear given uncertainties surrounding general macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, and COVID-19. We can provide no assurances that refining margins and demand will remain at current levels.

 

How We Evaluate Our Operations. Management uses certain financial and operating measures to analyze segment performance. These measures are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: refinery operations gross profit (deficit), refining gross profit (deficit) per bbl, tolling and terminaling gross profit (deficit), intercompany processing fees, refinery throughput, production and sales data, and refinery downtime.

 

Refining Gross Profit (Deficit) per Bbl. We use refining gross profit (deficit) per bbl as a downstream benchmark. This non-GAAP measure supplements presented GAAP financial information. Management uses refining gross profit (deficit) per bbl to analyze our core refining results of operations, assess internal performance against budgeted and forecasted amounts, and evaluate impacts on our financial performance considering potential capital investments. As this non-GAAP measure has important limitations as an analytical tool, it should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial measures. We believe this measure may help investors, analysts, lenders, and rating agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with presented GAAP financial results.

 

Storage Tank Rental Revenue and Ancillary Services Fees. Tolling and terminaling revenue primarily represents storage tank rental fees and ancillary services fees (such as for in-tank blending) associated with customer tank rental agreements. As a result, tank rental revenue and ancillary services fees combined are one of the measures management uses to evaluate the performance of our tolling and terminaling business segment.

 

Operating Costs and Expenses. We manage operating costs and expenses in tandem with meeting environmental, safety, and regulatory requirements while maintaining the mechanical integrity of our assets. Operating costs and expenses are comprised primarily of labor, repair, other maintenance, and utility costs. Refinery operating expenses generally remain stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but they can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed and the timing of those expenses within the reporting period. Tolling and terminaling operating costs and expenses are relatively fixed.

 

Intercompany processing fees. We have an intercompany tolling agreement in place between LE and LRM related to naphtha throughput volumes moving through the naphtha stabilizer unit at the Nixon facility. Although intercompany transactions are eliminated during consolidation, evaluation of intercompany processing fees provides investors with helpful information related to our tolling and terminaling business segment.

 

Refinery Throughput, Production, and Sales Data. The revenue generated from the refinery operations business segment primarily depends on the crude oil volumes processed into refined products and the refined products volumes sold to customers. These volumes are affected by the supply and demand of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products in the direct and indirect markets served by our assets, as well as refinery downtime.

 

Refinery Downtime. The Nixon refinery periodically experiences planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime results in lost margin opportunity, potential increased maintenance expense, and reduced refined products inventory, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our payment obligations.

Consolidated Results

Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of our refinery operations and tolling and terminaling business segments.

 

Q1 2024 Versus Q1 2023

Overview.  Net income for Q1 2024 totaled $6.6 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $1.12 per share, in Q1 2023. The $10.1 million, or $0.68 per share, decrease in net income between the periods was the result of less favorable refining margins on lower refinery throughput, production, and sales volumes.

 

Total Revenue from Operations.  Total revenue from operations was $91.0 million for Q1 2024 compared to $116.7 million for Q1 2023, representing a decrease of 22.0%.  The decrease related to declines in both refinery operations and tolling and terminaling revenue. Compared to Q1 2023, refinery operations revenue declined 21.6% in Q1 2024 primarily due to lower sales volume (17.3%). Tolling and terminaling revenue declined 45.2% as tank rental fees associated with temporary terminal service fees from Pilot in Q1 2023 did not recur in Q1 2024. 

 

Total Cost of Goods Sold.  Total cost of goods sold was $79.2 million for Q1 2024 compared to $96.2 million for Q1 2023, representing a decrease of 17.6%.  The decrease was related to lower sales volume.  On a per bbl basis, direct operating expenses between the periods remained relatively flat at less than $1.00.

 

Total Gross Profit.  Gross profit totaled $11.8 million for Q1 2024 compared to gross profit of $20.5 million for Q1 2023. The 42.3% decrease in gross profit between the periods was the result of less favorable refining margins and lower refinery production and sales volume in Q1 2024.

 

Total General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $1.0 million in Q1 2024 compared to $1.2 million in Q1 2023, representing a decrease of 18.6%. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in professional service fees, including legal expenses.

 

Total Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses remained flat at $0.7 million for both Q1 2024 and Q1 2023.

 

Total Other Income (Expense).  Total other expense in Q1 2024 totaled $1.4 million compared to total other expense of $1.3 million in Q1 2023, representing a decrease of 2.7%. The decrease was due to lower related party interest expenses in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023.  Total other expense primarily relates to interest expense associated with third-party and related party secured loan agreements.

Midstream Operations

 

Our tolling and terminaling business segment is owned by LRM and NPS.  Assets within this segment include petroleum storage tanks and loading and unloading facilities. Tolling and terminaling revenue is derived from storage tank rental fees, ancillary services fees (such as for in-tank blending), and tolling and reservation fees for use of the naphtha stabilizer.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

Capital Resources and Liquidity

We had working capital of $0.3 million at March 31, 2024 and a working capital deficit of $6.1 million at December 31, 2023, representing a $6.4 million improvement.  Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had $40.9 million and $33.3 million in working capital at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a $7.6 million increase. The significant increase in working capital between the periods was due to increases in accounts receivable - related party and inventory.

 

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.1 million and $18.7 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of $7.6 million.  Restricted cash, noncurrent totaled $1.0 million and $0.0 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and related to a Veritex payment reserve account. Accounts receivable—related party, which was associated with the sale of jet fuel to LEH, totaled $11.7 million and $4.2 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

We generally rely on revenue from operations, including sales of refined products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, Affiliates, and financing to meet our liquidity needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to: (i) purchasing crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, (ii) reimbursing LEH for direct operating expenses and paying the LEH operating fee under the Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, (iii) servicing debt, (iv) maintaining and improving the Nixon facility through capital expenditures, and (v) meeting regulatory compliance requirements. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations.

 

During 2023, we entered into the Veritex First Amended Forbearance Agreement, Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement (which has expired), Kissick Forbearance Agreement, and LEH Payment Agreement. We continue to actively explore additional funding to refinance and restructure debt and further improve working capital. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all.

 

Refining margins, which are affected by commodity prices and refined product demand, are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital. Similarly, capital, credit, and commodity markets, as well as armed conflicts in the Middle East and Europe continue to evolve, and the extent to which these factors may impact our working capital, commodity prices, refined product demand, supply chain, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence.  In the long term, we may not be able to manage business disruptions or execute our business strategy. We may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

Cash Flow from Operations.  We used cash flow from operations of $6.3 million for Q1 2024 compared to cash flow from operations of $13.8 million for Q1 2023. The $20.0 million decrease in cash flow from operations between the periods was primarily due to a build in inventory in preparation for an upcoming turnaround, an increase in accounts receivable—related party resulting from a change in payment terms from net 15 to net 30 under the Amended and Restated Jet Fuel Sales Agreement, decommissioning costs associated with our pipelines and facilities assets, and quicker payment turnarounds related to accounts payable.

 

Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $0 for both Q1 2024 and Q1 2023. Due to continued uncertainties surrounding general macroeconomic conditions related to inflation, interest rates, and capital and credit markets, geopolitical tensions, including military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and escalations in the Middle East, and COVID-19, we anticipate continuing to limit capital expenditures throughout 2024. However, to the extent we can capitalize on green energy growth opportunities, we may finance capital expenditures through project-based government loans.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

We account for our capital expenditures in accordance with GAAP. We also classify capital expenditures as ‘maintenance’ if the expenditure maintains capacity or throughput or as ‘expansion’ if the expenditure increases capacity or throughput capabilities. Although classification is generally a straightforward process, in certain circumstances the determination is a matter of management judgment and discretion.  We budget for maintenance capital expenditures throughout the year on a project-by-project basis. Projects are determined based on maintaining safe and efficient operations, meeting customer needs, complying with operating policies and applicable law, and producing economic benefits, such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses.

 

Financing Activities.  During Q1 2024, Blue Dolphin made payments debt principal totaling $0.3 million.  During Q1 2023, Blue Dolphin made payments on debt principal totaling $0.6 million and paid off amounts owed to LEH totaling $1.2 million related to a June 2017 promissory note, as amended, for Blue Dolphin working capital.

Lease Agreements.

Office Lease.  We maintain our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas.  In May 2023, BDSC signed a 12-month extension to its existing operating lease.  The extended term commences on September 1, 2023 and expires on August 31, 2024.  Under the amended agreement, the annual rent was reduced from $31.00 per square foot to $30.00 per square foot, resulting in a monthly base rental amount of $0.02 million.  Management is currently exploring leasing options.

 

An Affiliate, LEH, subleases a portion of the Houston office space. BDSC received sublease income from LEH totaling $0.01 million for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

 

Tank Lease. LE leases tanks from Ingleside under the LE Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement.  Lease expense associated with the LE Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement totaled $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Forbearances and Defaults.

Veritex Forbearance Agreements. Under the Veritex Forbearance Agreement, LE and LRM paid Veritex: (i) $4.3 million in past due principal and interest at the non-default rate (excluding late fees), (ii) $1.0 million into a payment reserve account, and (iii) $0.04 million in Veritex attorney fees. The Veritex Forbearance Agreement expired on September 30, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex First Amended Forbearance Agreement. The First Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on December 29, 2023, and was superseded by the Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement.  The Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29, 2024.  During each of these forbearance periods, Veritex agreed to forbear from testing borrowers’ compliance with financial covenants as specified in the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 and forbear from exercising its rights or remedies with respect to non-compliance with the financial covenants. 

 

Kissick Forbearance Agreement. Pursuant to the Kissick Forbearance Agreement, Kissick Noteholder agreed to forbear from exercising any of its rights and remedies related to existing defaults pertaining to payment violations under the Kissick Debt.  Under the terms of the Kissick Forbearance Agreement, LE agreed to make monthly principal and interest payments totaling $0.5 million beginning in April 2023, continuing on the first of each month through February 2025, with a final payment of $0.4 million to Kissick Noteholder on March 1, 2025. LE paid Kissick Noteholder $1.5 million and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of the filing date of this report, the Kissick Debt was in forbearance related to past defaults prior to April 2023.

 

LEH Payment Agreement.  Pursuant to the LEH Payment Agreement, LEH agreed to forbear from exercising any of its rights and remedies related to existing defaults pertaining to payment violations under the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement.  Under the terms of the LEH Payment Agreement, BDPL agreed to make interest-only monthly payments approximating $0.05 million beginning in May 2023, continuing on the fifteenth of each month through April 2025. Beginning in May 2025, BDPL agreed to make principal and interest monthly payments approximating $0.4 million through April 2027. Interest will be incurred throughout the agreement term, including the interest-only payment period. BDPL paid LEH approximately $0.1 million and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. As of the filing date of this report, the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement was in forbearance related to past defaults prior to May 2023.

 

Defaults. As of March 31, 2024 and through the filing date of this report, we were in default under the NPS Term Loan Due 2031 due to covenant violations.  We were also in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034; the Veritex Second Amended Forbearance Agreement expired on March 29 2024. Defaults may permit lenders to declare the amounts owed under the related loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise their rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies under secured loan agreements that are in default could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations.  In such a case, the trading price of our Common Stock and the value of an investment in our Common Stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our Common Stock losing their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

We can provide no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under secured loan agreements that are in default, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) LE, LRM, NPS, or BDPL will be able to refinance or restructure the debt, and/or (iii) third parties will provide future forbearances or default waivers, particularly if the banks with whom we have relationships fail. If one or more banks fail, we could be exposed to additional events of default (if not cured or waived) under existing secured loan agreements. Defaults under our secured loan agreements and any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies related to such defaults may have a material adverse effect on our business, the trading price of our Common Stock, and on the value of an investment in our Common Stock, and holders of our Common Stock could lose their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety. If the debt associated with secured loan agreements is accelerated and we are unable to refinance or restructure the debt or obtain default waivers, we may have to consider other options, including selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs, reducing cash requirements, filing bankruptcy, or ceasing operating.

 

Concentration of Customers Risk

We routinely assess the financial strength of our customers.  To date, we have not experienced significant write-downs in accounts receivable balances.  We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.

One of our significant customers is LEH, an Affiliate. The Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under the Amended and Restated Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and sells the jet fuel to the DLA under preferential pricing terms due to its HUBZone certification.  The jet fuel, which is stored at the Nixon Facility, is lifted by the Affiliate as needed.  For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Affiliate accounted for 30.7% and 30.3% of total revenue from operations, respectively. Accounts receivable by the Affiliate represented $11.7 million at March 31, 2024.

 

Regulatory Activities

BOEM. See "Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings —Unresolved Matters—BOEM Supplemental Pipeline Bonds." 

 

BSEE. Offshore Pipelines and Platform Requirements .  

BDPL has pipelines and platform assets subject to BSEE’s idle iron regulations.  Idle iron regulations require lessees and rights-of-way holders to permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when they are  no longer useful for operations.  Until such structures are abandoned or removed, lessees and rights-of-way holders are required to inspect and maintain the assets in accordance with regulatory requirements. 

 

Platform Inspections.  We are required by BSEE to perform annual structural inspections of our offshore platform, as well as to perform monthly platform checks of navigational aids, fog horns, and lifesaving equipment. In March 2023, BSEE issued BDPL an INC for failing to perform the required 2021 and 2022 structural surveys for the GA-288C platform and for failing to provide BSEE with such survey results. In April 2023, BSEE granted BDPL an extension for completing the required platform inspection until May 30, 2023.  Although BDPL requested a second extension, BSEE denied BDPL’s request. BDPL completed the platform inspection on August 26, 2023 and submitted the survey report to BSEE on September 6, 2023. Because BDPL failed to comply with the INC within the allotted timeframe, BSEE proposed an administrative civil penalty of approximately $0.2 million on October 24, 2023.  The proposed administrative civil penalty was finalized on January 26, 2024, for $0.2 million.  We recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of  March 31, 2024.  Although BDPL filed an appeal to the civil penalty on March 25, 2024, BDPL filed a motion to withdraw the appeal on April 17, 2024.  BDPL paid the civil penalty related to platform inspections on April 19, 2024.

 

Decommissioning Obligations.  Because our pipelines and facilities assets have been inactive for an extended period, BOEM mandated that they be decommissioned. In October 2023, management met BSEE to discuss BDPL’s path forward for meeting decommissioning requirements. Management worked with a consultant to develop a decommissioning plan, and BDPL submitted its decommissioning plan to the agency in November 2023. Although the decommissioning of these assets was delayed due to cash constraints associated with historical net losses and the impact of COVID-19, a significant portion of the decommissioning project was completed from late December 2023 to mid- February 2024. Based on updated estimates for pipeline decommissioning, platform removal, and associated costs, as well as resource availability and projected weather conditions, we believe decommissioning and remediation of all associated INCs will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2024.  However, BDPL’s work plan does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to comply with BSEE’s mandate or BSEE’s authority to impose financial penalties. Further, there can be no assurance that BDPL can complete anticipated work or predict the outcome of BSEE INCs.  Accordingly, we did not record a liability related to potential penalties on our consolidated balance sheets as of  March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Due to BDPL’s failure to comply with BSEE requirements, BDPL could still be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failing to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL’s operator designation, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.  At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BDPL maintained $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets, which amount does not include potential penalties.

Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies.  Our significant accounting policies relate to use of estimates, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses, inventory, property and equipment, leases, revenue recognition, income taxes, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, asset retirement obligations, and computation of earnings per share.

 

Estimates. The nature of our business requires that we make estimates and assumptions in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although commodity price volatility, recession and inflation, armed conflicts in the Middle East and Europe and associated sanctions on Russian crude products, and severe weather resulting from climate change have impacted these estimates and assumptions, we are continually working to mitigate future risks. However, the extent to which these factors may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.

 

We assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with information reasonably available to us as of March 31, 2024 and through the filing date of this report.  The accounting matters assessed included, but not limited to, our allowance for credit losses, inventory, and related reserves, and the carrying value of long-lived assets.

 

New Accounting Standards and Disclosures

New Pronouncements Adopted.  During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not adopt any ASUs.

 

New Pronouncements Issued, Not Yet Effective. 

 

  ● ASU 2023-09 — Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). In December 2023, the FASB issued

     ASU 2023-09, requiring us to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide

     additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require us to disaggregate

     our income taxes paid disclosure by federal and state taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual

     jurisdictions. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 in the fourth quarter of 2025. ASU 2023-09 allows for adoption using either a

     prospective or retrospective transition

     method.

 

  ● ASU 2023-07 — Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). In November 2023, the

     FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, requiring us to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to our chief operating

     decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require us to disclose the title and position of our CODM and how the CODM

     uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 is

     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within physical years beginning after December

     15, 2024.  Early adoption is permitted.  We will adopt ASU 2023-07 in our fourth quarter of 2024 using a retrospective transition

     method.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Legal Proceedings

  

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal matters incidental to the routine operation of our business, such as mechanic’s liens and contract-related disputes.  We may also become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings, and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory, and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters and certain matters may require years to resolve. Although we cannot provide assurance, we believe that an adverse resolution of the matters described below would not have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or consolidated results of operations.

 

Resolved Matters

Pilot Dispute Related to Terminal Services Agreement. Effective May 9, 2019, NPS and Pilot entered into a Terminal Services Agreement, pursuant to which NPS agreed to store jet fuel purchased by Pilot at the Nixon facility. On August 25, 2022, Pilot provided the 60-day notice of its intent to terminate the Terminal Services Agreement, which became effective on October 24, 2022. As of the Terminal Services Agreement termination date, approximately 185,000 bbls of Pilot’s jet fuel remained at the Nixon facility.

 

On October 28, 2022, Pilot commenced an action and application for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) against NPS in Harris County District Court (the “Texas Action”). After a hearing on the application on October 28, 2022, Pilot’s application for the TRO was denied the same day.  On December 2, 2022, NPS filed its answer in the Texas Action. On December 6, 2022, NPS provided notice under Section 7.206(a) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code ("TBCC") of its intent to sell the remaining inventory of Pilot’s jet fuel at the Nixon facility by January 7, 2023. After negotiations, NPS agreed to forbear from exercising its remedies under the TBCC while the parties explored a potential dispute compromise pursuant to the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, with a forbearance period terminating on February 28, 2023. As part of the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, Pilot paid NPS approximately $1.5 million in January 2023. 

 

On March 31, 2023, NPS and Pilot executed the Pilot Forbearance Amendment, extending the forbearance period and all deadlines in the unresolved Texas Action to June 15, 2023.  As part of the Pilot Forbearance Amendment, Pilot paid NPS approximately $1.1 million and $0.2 million in April and June 2023, respectively. The parties also negotiated the sale of all 185,000 bbls of stored jet fuel in April 2023. On June 16, 2023, following the expiration of the Pilot Forbearance and Accommodation Agreement, the parties agreed to extend the deadline for responses to outstanding discovery requests in the Texas Action to August 31, 2023. On August 28, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion to stay this case in anticipation of planned mediation in December 2023 to settle all outstanding disputes.

 

Pilot Settlement Agreement.  A confidential Settlement Agreement by and among LEH, NPS, LE, LRM, Lazarus San Antonio Refinery, LLC, and Blue Dolphin (together the "Lazarus Entities"), on the one hand, and Pilot, Starlight Relatively Holdings LLC, Starlight Relativity Acquisition Company LLC, Tartan, The San Antonio Refinery LLC, and Falls City Terminal LP (together, the "Pilot Entities"), on the other hand, was executed on December 29, 2023.  Among other matters addressed, NPS's contract-related dispute related to set-off payments and LRM’s contracted-related dispute involving a revenue-sharing arrangement for storing and selling crude oil with Pilot and Tartan, respectively, were fully resolved, and the parties agreed to mutually release all claims against each other.  Further, Pilot and NPS agreed to take such actions as necessary to dismiss the Texas Action.  For the avoidance of doubt, all contractual agreements between the Lazarus Entities and Pilot Entities were terminated.

 

OSHA Settlement Agreement. In September 2022, we entered into an Informal Settlement Agreement with OSHA related to process safety management violations at the Nixon refinery. Under the agreement, we paid penalties totaling $0.05 million in November 2022. We remediated a significant portion of identified violations before December 31, 2022. We remediated the remaining violations on a progressive schedule by April 2023.

Legal Proceedings & Risk Factors

 

Unresolved Matters

BOEM Supplemental Pipeline Bonds. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator’s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the statutory bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning pipelines and platforms at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.

 

Historically, BDPL maintained $0.9 million in pipeline bonds with BOEM to decommission its trunk pipeline offshore in federal waters.  In March 2018, BOEM ordered BDPL to provide additional financial assurance totaling approximately $4.8 million for five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way, an increase of approximately $3.9 million.  In June 2018, BOEM issued BDPL INCs for each right-of-way that failed to comply. BDPL appealed the INCs to the IBLA.  Although the IBLA granted multiple extension requests, the Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior indicated that BOEM would not consent to further extensions. The solicitor’s office signaled that BDPL’s adherence to decommissioning its offshore pipelines and platform would likely help in future discussions with BOEM related to the INCs. Fulfilling abandonment obligations related to the subject assets will significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of supplemental pipeline bonds required by BOEM, which may serve to partially or fully resolve the INCs. 

 

BDPL’s pending appeal of the BOEM INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance or of BOEM’s authority to impose financial penalties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet additional supplemental pipeline bond requirements. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional supplemental pipeline bonds or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We cannot predict the outcome of the supplemental pipeline bond INCs.  Accordingly, we did not record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in pipeline rights-of-way surety bonds issued to BOEM through RLI. However, as noted below, RLI desires to reduce its risk profile related to BDPL's bonds.  Of the pipeline rights-of-way bonds, $0.7 million was credit-backed and $0.2 million was cash-backed.

 

RLI Surety Bonds. Blue Dolphin currently has several surety bonds through RLI as required by different regulatory agencies, including BOEM and the Railroad Commission of Texas. The bonds total approximately $1.25 million in the aggregate, of which $0.2 million is collateralized in cash. In June, July, and December 2023, RLI demanded Blue Dolphin provide additional cash collateral or a letter of credit totaling approximately $1.0 million or provide bond exonerations and replacement bonds.  Although Blue Dolphin received a proposal from another surety to replace the RLI bonds at a 50% collateral requirement, management was hopeful Blue Dolphin and RLI could reach an understanding whereby the existing bonds could be maintained until BDPL completed decommissioning of the subject assets. Abandonment of BDPL’s offshore pipeline and platform assets will eliminate the need for all BOEM supplemental pipeline bonds, reducing the amount of surety bonds held by RLI from $1.25 million to $0.25 million.  On February 19, 2024, RLI filed suit against Blue Dolphin, BDPL, and BDEX seeking an injunction for the payment of approximately $1.0 million of additional collateral for the bonds. BDPL filed its answer to RLI's lawsuit on April 23, 2024 denying RLI's claims.

 

TCEQ Proposed Agreed Order. In October 2021, LRM received a proposed agreed order from the TCEQ for alleged solid and hazardous waste violations discovered during an investigation from January to March 2020.  The proposed agreed order assessed an administrative penalty of $0.4 million and identified actions needed to correct the alleged violations. In September 2023, TCEQ presented its final penalty offer of $0.35 million, which LRM accepted. Although LRM believes the penalty matter is resolved, LRM expects to continue working with TCEQ to remediate certain open items fully. At   March 31, 2024, we accrued $0.4 million on our balance sheet within accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to this matter. 

 

BSEE Civil Penalties. We are required by BSEE to perform annual structural inspections of our offshore platform, as well as to perform monthly platform checks of navigational aids, fog horns, and lifesaving equipment. In March 2023, BSEE issued BDPL an INC for failing to perform the required 2021 and 2022 structural surveys for the GA- 288C platform and for failing to provide BSEE with such survey results. In April 2023, BSEE granted BDPL an extension for completing the required platform inspection until May 30, 2023.  Although BDPL requested a second extension, BSEE denied BDPL’s request.  BDPL completed the platform inspection on August 26, 2023 and submitted the survey report to BSEE on September 6, 2023. Because BDPL failed to comply with the INC within the allotted timeframe, BSEE proposed an administrative civil penalty of approximately $0.2 million on October 24, 2023.  The proposed administrative civil penalty was finalized on January 26, 2024, for $0.2 million.  We recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of March 31, 2024.  Although BDPL filed an appeal to the civil penalty on March 25, 2024, BDPL filed a motion to withdraw the appeal on April 17, 2024.  BDPL paid the civil penalty related to platform inspections on April 19, 2024.

 

On April 26, 2024, BDPL received a civil penalty advisory letter from BSEE of the same date related to INCs issued by the agency in September 2023.  The letter indicates that the agency is reviewing the INCS, which relate to BDPL's offshore assets in federal waters.  BSEE will provide BDPL information related to its review within 90 days from the date of its letter. 

 

Defaults under Secured Loan Agreements. We are currently in default under certain secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties. See “Notes (1), (3), and (10)” for additional disclosures related to third-party and related-party debt, default on such debt, and the potential effects of such defaults on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If third parties exercise their rights and remedies due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, careful consideration should be given to the risk factors discussed under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business.  There have been no material changes in our assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
