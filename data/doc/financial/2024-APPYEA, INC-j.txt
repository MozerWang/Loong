Since its incorporation and as of the financial statements date, Sleepx holds 66.7% of the voting interest of Ta-nooma.

 

Strategic Development

 

The company flagship product is AppySleep – A Biofeedback snoring treatment wristband, combined with the AppySleep App (“AppySleep”).

 

The AppySleep product is currently in serial manufacturing and commercial stage.

 

Financial position

 

The financial statements are presented on a going-concern basis. To date, the Company has not generated any significant revenues, suffered recurring losses from operations, incurred negative cash flows from operating activities, and is dependent upon external sources for financing its operations. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,570,000 and a stockholders’ deficiency of $3,153,000. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to finance its operating activities by raising capital. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing needed for its long-term research and development activities on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If the Company will not have sufficient liquidity resources, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates or may be required to implement cost reduction measures and may be required to delay part of its development programs.

 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments for the values of assets and liabilities and their classification that may be necessary in the event that the Company is no longer able to continue its operations as a “going concern”.

 

                                                                   9

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The interim financial statements do not include a full disclosure as required in annual financial statements and should be read with the annual financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2023 from which the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet dated December 31, 2023, was derived. The accounting policies implemented in the interim financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies implemented in the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023, except of the following accounting pronouncement adopted by the Company.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

 

Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)” (“ASU 2020-06”), which is intended to address issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. For convertible instruments, ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stocks, and enhances information transparency by making targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share guidance on the basis of feedback from financial statement users. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements.

 

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326),” referred to herein as ASU 2016-13, which significantly changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 replaced the existing incurred loss model with an expected credit loss model that requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on most financial assets and certain other instruments. Under ASU 2016-13 credit impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses, rather than as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset. The impairment allowance is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. Once the new pronouncement is adopted by the Company, the allowance for credit losses must be adjusted for management’s current estimate at each reporting date. The new guidance provides no threshold for recognition of impairment allowance. Therefore, entities must also measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. For instance, trade receivables that are either current or not yet due may not require an allowance reserve under current generally accepted accounting principles, but under the new standard, the Company will have to estimate an allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables under ASU 2016-13. The Company determined the adoption of this new accounting guidance and the effect on its financial statements throughout the period until implementation, and have no impact on the financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” related to improvements to income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update require enhanced jurisdictional and other disaggregated disclosures for the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

 

Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements

 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company’s management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue Recognition at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.

 

We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.

 

Our contracts are typically governed by a customer purchase order. The contract generally specifies the delivery of what constitutes a single performance obligation. If an arrangement involves multiple performance obligations, the items are analyzed to determine the separate units of accounting, whether the items have value on a standalone basis and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of their standalone selling price. The total contract transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based upon the relative standalone selling prices of the performance obligations. The standalone selling price is based on an observable price for services sold to other comparable customers.

 

As discussed in more detail below, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services under the terms of a contract and is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. We do not have any material extended payment terms, as payment is due at or shortly after the time of the sale. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue.

 

A contract liability is recognized as deferred revenue when we invoice customers, or receive customer cash payments, in advance of satisfying the related performance obligation(s) under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when we have satisfied the related performance obligation.

 

We have one main revenue stream: wristband sales, with the AppySleep App. For this revenue stream, our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, and therefore, revenue is recognized at point in time when a customer takes control of the good or asset created by the service. Factors that may indicate transfer of control are when we have the right to receive payment for the good or service, when the legal title of the asset has been transferred, physical possession of the asset has been transferred, the customer obtains the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and the customer accepts the asset. For customers, control is transferred upon delivery.

 

We leverage drop-ship shipments with our partners and suppliers to deliver wristbands to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-ship arrangements on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction when the product is received by the customer because we control the product prior to transfer to the customer. We also assume primary responsibility for the fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if something were to happen to the hardware during shipping, we set the price of the product charged to the customer.

 

The Company intend to recognize records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.

 

                                                                   10

               C.   On January 1, 2024, the Company engaged with a note holder as a consultant. For his services, he was granted a

               D.   During the first quarter of 2024, the company received an additional investment of $456,431 and registered shares

                     to be issued from that investment in the amount of 7,500,000 common

                     shares.

                     

               E.   On August 11, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court against our Chairman and majority

                     shareholder, Boris Molchadsky, G.P.I.S Ltd., an entity controlled by Mr. Molchadsky, Nexsense, Inc. (the former

                     shareholder of SleepX Ltd.) and SleepX, Ltd., our subsidiary (collectively, the “Defendants”) [Civil lawsuit

                     number 25441-08-22]. The suit was filed by a fund operating out of Israel. A copy of the claim was served to the

                     defendants only six months after it was submitted to court, on February 21, 2023. The lawsuit is based on the

                     alleged breach of partnership and loan agreements as well as other related allegations, including violation of

                     agreements reached in a mediation proceeding that took place in 2015. On July 24, 2023, the Defendants (except

                     for Nexsense, Inc.) filed a statement of defense, denying the allegations and argued that the claim should be

                     dismissed, due to the statute of limitations, lack of cause of action, lack of jurisdiction, delay in filing the

                     claim, and respecting SleepX, also due to the lack of legal rivalry between SleepX and the

                     plaintiff.

                     

                    Recently, the Magistrate’s Court in Tel Aviv accepted the request regarding lack of material jurisdiction, and the

                     claim was then transferred to the economic department of the District Court in Tel

                     Aviv.

                     

                    A preliminary hearing was held on February 14, 2024. The presiding judge did not rule on the preliminary pleadings

                     and urged the parties to attempt mediation before the ruling. The parties are considering different mediators

                     (which must be mutually agreed to) and following the selection of a mediator, the parties will schedule a date

                     for the

                     mediation.

                     

                    The Company cannot, at this stage, know the effects, if any, of these actions on its subsidiary SleepX and / or

                     the Company, and accordingly, no provision was

                     recorded.

Overview

 

AppYea, Inc. is a digital health company, focused on the development of accurate wearable monitoring solutions to treat sleep apnea and snoring and fundamentally improve quality of life.

 

Our solutions are based on our proprietary intellectual property portfolio comprised of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies for the tracking, analysis, and diagnosis of vital signs and other physical parameters during sleep time, offering extreme accuracy at affordable cost.

 

AI is a broad term generally used to describe conditions where a machine mimics “cognitive” functions associated with human intelligence, such as “learning” and “problem solving. Basic AI includes machine learning, where a machine uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about a given phenomenon. The machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and algorithms that provide it with the ability to learn how to perform the task.

 

General Background

 

Snoring is a general disorder caused due to repetitive collapsing and narrowing of the upper airway. Individuals with snoring problems are at increased risk of accidental injury, depression and anxiety, heart disease and stroke. Currently available treatments include surgical and non-surgical devices.

 

According to Fior Markets, a market intelligence company, the Global Anti-Snoring Treatment Market is expected to grow from USD 4.3 billion in 2020 to USD 8.6 billion by 2028, with a 9.07% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. While North America had the largest market share of 28.12% in 2020, Asia-Pacific region is witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles in emerging economies.

 

Currently available anti-snoring devices consist mainly of oral appliances that are recommended for use by patients suffering from snoring or obstructive sleep apnea. These appliances are put before sleep and have a simple function of pushing either the lower jaw or the tongue forward. This keeps the epiglottis parted from the uvula and prevents the snoring sound created by the vibration of soft tissues of palate.

 

                                                                   17



                                                                    

 

Sleep apnea is a severe sleep condition in which individuals frequently stop breathing in their sleeping, this leads to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and the rest of the body which, in turn may lead to critical problems. There are three main types of apneas: (i) Obstructive Sleep Apnea (“OSA”), the most common form caused by the throat muscles relaxing during sleep; (ii) Central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain doesn’t send the proper signals to the muscles that control the breathing; and (iii) complex sleep apnea syndrome, which occurs when an individual suffers from both OSA and central sleep apnea. While OSA is a common disorder in the elderly population, affecting approximately 13 to 32% of people aged over 65, sleep apnea can occur at any age and affects approximately 25% of men and nearly 10% of women.

 

In 2020, North America dominated the sleep apnea device market, as it accounted for 49% of the revenue, the global market size was valued at USD 3.7 billion and is expected to expand by 6.2% CAGR, according to a report by Grand View Research Inc., reaching USD 6.1 billion by 2028.

 

The global sleep apnea and snoring market is driven in large part by solutions that can be applied in at home-settings or healthcare settings, as these tools will drive decisions regarding specific treatments and the associated outlays. However, despite advances in medical imaging and other diagnostic tools, misdiagnosis remains a common occurrence. We believe that improved diagnoses and outcomes are achievable through the adoption of AI-based decision support tools.

 

Our Products and Product Candidates

 

Our initial focus is on the development of supporting solutions utilizing our proprietary platform. Our current business plan focuses on two principal devices and an App currently in development:

 

AppySleep – Biofeedback snoring treatment wristband, combined with the AppySleep App.

 

The AppySleep app uses unique algorithms developed by SleepX combined with sensors to monitor physiological parameters during sleep. Based on real time reactions, the wristband will vibrate, when necessary, in order to decrease the snoring and regulate breathing by gently bringing the user to a lighter sleep or change his sleep position and thus ceasing the snoring event.

 

The AppySleep product is currently in serial manufacturing stage and sales.

 

AppySleep LAB – Is a medical application, intended for downloading on a smartphone, and used to monitor breathing patterns in the sleep and identify sleep apnea episodes without direct contact to the user.

 

The AppySleep LAB product is to begin final calibration, following which we will file for 510(k) FDA approval.

 

AppySleep PRO – is a wristband for the treatment of sleep apnea using biofeedback in combination with AppySleep LAB app. The unique algorithms of AppySleep LAB, combined with the wristband sensors, monitor sleep apnea events and additional physiological parameters during sleep, and when necessary, the wristband vibrates according to real time events, in order to decrease and cease sleep apnea events.

 

The AppySleep PRO and AppySleep LAB are currently in development stages, following which it would be ready to begin the testing stage in preparation for filing for FDA approval.

 

Our Strategy

 

We started marketing of the AppySleep app and wristband in the first quarter of 2024. Concurrently, we plan to file a 510(k) FDA submission for the AppySleep LAB app for the non-contact diagnosis of sleep apnea during 2024, and an FDA process for AppySleep PRO for the treatment of sleep apnea during 2026.

 

Our goal over the next five years is to establish our technology and related products as the gold standard for the targeted sectors. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

 

                                                                   18



                                                                    

 

Develop and expand a balanced and diverse pipeline of products and product candidates. Our core platform technologies will include innovative anti-snoring and sleep apnea related devices and product candidates in various development and clinical stages. We plan to add products and product candidates to our pipeline by expanding our technologies being developed to additional indications and through investing in new technologies, products and product candidates. By maintaining this multi-product approach, we aim to provide a broad and comprehensive product offering, which we believe will result in multiple value inflection events, reduced risks to our potentially business associated with a particular product or product candidate and increased return on investment. Furthermore, product candidates that we develop may create attractive collaboration opportunities with diagnostics, medical devices and medical supplies companies.

 

Maintain a global, diverse network of specialists to accelerate knowledge synergies and innovation. We will utilize a global network of specialists to identify large and growing patient populations with significant unmet needs, evaluate and prioritize potential technologies, assist in designing development plans and diagnostic protocols and determine potential indications of our platform technologies to our target patient populations in various territories. We believe that maintaining this diverse network of specialists and industry specialists will allow us to continue to maximize knowledge and cost synergies, utilize shared commercial infrastructure across products, reduce risks of development and commercialization delays to our overall business and leverage our current and future platform technologies and technologies for additional products and product candidates.

 

Establish distribution channels to maximize the commercial potential of our products. We plan to seek out collaborative arrangements with major healthcare providers and consumer specialists to facilitate market adoption of our product candidates. We believe that such institutions are well positioned to directly benefit from improvements in accurate diagnosis and reduction of cost of care associated with the use of our product candidates. We also believe that the marginal cost of our product candidates compared to potential savings will make it economical for healthcare institutions to adopt our products regardless of whether or not additional costs of purchase of these products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs and commercial insurance companies. Through cooperation with healthcare providers, we aim to develop and prove an economic model beneficial to them. In parallel, we intend selling directly, through our website and other online webstores worldwide. Thereafter, we plan to engage with private insurance plans to develop reimbursement programs encouraging the use of our product candidates. We expect that adoption rates of our product candidates will increase if hospitals and other medical institutions are compensated, in full or in part, for additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.

 

We established a logistical distribution facility in the US.

Key Financial Terms and Metrics

 

The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.

 

Revenues

 

We have generated $13,000 in revenues from product sales as of 03.31.2024.

 

Research and Development Expenses

 

The process of researching and developing our product candidates is lengthy, unpredictable, and subject to many risks. We expect to continue incurring substantial expenses for the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates. We are unable, with any certainty, to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those expenses will be incurred. The design and development of our devices will consume a large proportion of our current, as well as projected, resources.

 

Our research and development costs include costs are comprised of:

 

● internal recurring costs, such as personnel-related costs (salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other costs), materials and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs attributable to research and development functions; and

 

                                                                   20



                                                                    

 

● fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as programing, preclinical testing, manufacturing and related testing and clinical trial activities.

 

General and Administrative Expenses

 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other personnel-related costs associated with executive, administrative and other support staff. Other significant general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with professional fees for accounting, auditing, insurance costs, consulting and legal services, along with facility and maintenance costs attributable to general and administrative functions.

 

Financial Expenses

 

Financial expenses consist primarily impact of exchange rate derived from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar currencies. Other financial expenses include bank’s fees and interest on long term loans. Financial income derives mainly from change in derivative value of convertible loans.

Revenues. We recorded revenues of $13,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 from sales of our AppySleep wristband.

 

No revenues were recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

 

Research and Development Expenses, Research and development expenses increased from $9,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $60,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to increased investment in intellectual property and development of our products during the first quarter of 2024.

 

Sales and Marketing. We recorded sales and marketing expenses of $54,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 for sales of our AppySleep wristband through Amazon and our website.

 

No sales and marketing expenses were recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

 

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased from $427,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $294,000 for the for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to salary and professional services expenses, of which $147,281 were non-cash stock based non-cash compensation expenses resulting from options awards to our management and advisors.

 

                                                                   21



                                                                    

 

Loss. Loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1,244,000 and is primarily attributable to change in fair value of convertible loans caused mainly by the rise in the stock price.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

From inception, we have funded our operations from a combination of loans and sales of equity.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had a total of $373,000 in cash resources and approximately $3,825,000 of liabilities, all of which are current liabilities.

 

AppYea has experienced operating losses since its inception and had a total accumulated deficit of $7,570,000 as of March 31, 2024. We expect to incur additional costs and require additional capital. We have incurred losses in nearly every year since inception. These losses have resulted in significant cash used in operations. During the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash used in operations was approximately $257,000 and $97,000, respectively. We need to continue and amplify our research and development efforts for our product candidates (which are in various stages of development), strengthen our patent portfolio, establish operations processes and pursue FDA clearance and international regulatory approvals as we continue to conduct these activities, we expect the cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.

 

The following table provides a summary of operating, investing, and financing cash flows for the period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively:

 

                                                                                       For the three months ended        

                                                                                  March 31, 2024       March 31, 2023

Net cash used in operating activities                                           $          257,000               97,000 

Net cash used in investment activities                                          $           50,000                    0 

Net cash provided by Financing Activities                                       $          456,000              141,000 

 

Between June 2023 and March 2024, we raised an aggregate of $955,330 from private placement of shares of our common stock at a per share price of $0.01 and the issuance of warrants, exercisable for a two year period from the date of issuance for an identical number of shares at a per share exercise price of $0.04, and additional $225,000 from public capital raised through the company effective prospectus. In respect of the raise the investors are entitled to an aggregate 118,032,953 shares of our common stock and identical number of warrants, of which 86,776,100 have already been issued. The subscription proceeds are being used to complete the IOS design and development of our biofeedback snoring treatment wristband (AppySleep product) as well as general corporate matters.

 

Management believes that funds on hand, will enable us to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the third quarter of 2024. We need to raise additional operating capital in order to maintain operations as presently conducted and to realize our business plan.

 

Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date of these consolidated financial statements. However, the Company has incurred substantial losses. Our current liabilities exceed our current assets and available cash is not sufficient to fund the expected future operations. The Company is raising additional capital through debt and equity securities in order to continue the funding of its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company can raise enough funds or generate sufficient revenues to pay its obligations as they become due, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying value of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty.

 

We cannot be sure that future funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Due to often volatile nature of the financial markets, equity and debt financing may be difficult to obtain.

 

                                                                   22



                                                                    

 

We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of private or public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights, future revenue streams, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through private or public equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

 

Going Concern

 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We have a stockholders’ deficit of $3,153,000 and a working capital deficit of $3,407,000 on March 31 2024, as well as negative operating cash flows. Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the Quarter ended March 31, 2024, includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring losses and limited operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not Applicable.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2024, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

As a result of our evaluation, we identified a material weakness in our controls related to segregation of duties and other immaterial weaknesses in several areas of data management and documentation. Our management is composed of a small number of professionals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. Accordingly, and as a result of the material weakness identified above, we have concluded that the control deficiencies result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls. We continue to employ and refine a structure in which critical accounting policies, issues and estimates are identified, and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple reviews by executives. We expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future which we believe will mitigate the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

Except for the material weakness noted above, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   23



                                                                    

 

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

In August 11, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court against our Chairman and majority shareholder, Boris Molchadsky, G.P.I.S Ltd., an entity controlled by Mr. Molchadsky, Nexsense, Inc. (the former shareholder of SleepX Ltd.) and SleepX, Ltd., our subsidiary (collectively, the “Defendants”) [Civil lawsuit number 25441-08-22]. The suit was filed by a fund operating out of Israel. A copy of the claim was served to the defendants only six months after it was submitted to court, on February 21, 2023.

 

The lawsuit is based on the alleged breach of partnership and loan agreements as well as other related allegations, including violation of agreements reached in a mediation proceeding that took place in 2015.

 

The suit alleges that the Defendants, amongst other things, did not disclose to the plaintiff certain transactions to which the Plaintiff was presumably entitled to compensation and hence the plaintiff demanded an accounting of the transactions and refund of amounts invested. With respect to SleepX. the plaintiff alleged that it made a deal with Nexsense, Inc. which wasn’t disclosed to the plaintiff, while allegedly the technology and patents of Nexsense, Inc. were transferred to SleepX (which was established shortly before the reverse merger between AppYea and SleepX), thus allegedly aimed to the concealment of assets from the plaintiff.

 

On July 24, 2023, the Defendants (except for Nexsense, Inc.) filed a statement of defense, denying the allegations and argued that the claim should be dismissed, due to the statute of limitations, lack of cause of action, lack of jurisdiction, delay in filing the claim, and respecting SleepX, also due to the lack of legal rivalry between SleepX and the plaintiff.

 

In addition, the Defendants submitted several preliminary requests to dismiss the claim outright, including a plea to dismiss the claim on the grounds it was submitted to the magistrate court, which is not the competent court according to law, due to the economic nature of the claim. Nexsense, Inc. submitted a request to dismiss the claim against it because it was not properly served under the law (given the different service rules for defendants whose domicile is outside of Israel).

 

Recently, the Magistrate’s Court in Tel Aviv accepted the request regarding lack of material jurisdiction, and the claim was then transferred to the economic department of the District Court in Tel Aviv.

 

A preliminary hearing was held on February 14, 2024. The presiding judge did not rule on the preliminary pleadings and urged the parties to attempt mediation before the ruling. The parties are considering different mediators (which must be mutually agreed to) and following the selection of a mediator, the parties will schedule a date for the mediation.

 

We cannot, at this stage, know the effects, if any, of these actions on our subsidiary SleepX and / or the Company. However, SleepX together with the other Defendants, intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

 

Aside from the disclosure above, from time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions related to our intellectual property. Although the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions related to our intellectual property. Although the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
