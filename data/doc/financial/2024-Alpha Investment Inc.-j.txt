CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

 

This report includes forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Words such as, but not limited to, “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “targets,” “likely,” “aim,” “will,” “would,” “could,” and similar expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operation, business strategy and financial needs. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:

 

          ·         our lack of significant revenues and history of losses,

 

          ·         our ability to continue as a going concern,

 

          ·         our ability to raise additional working capital as necessary,

 

          ·         our ability to satisfy our obligations as they become due,

 

          ·         the failure to successfully commercialize our product or sustain market acceptance,

 

          ·         the reliance on third party agreements and relationships for development of our business,

 

          ·         the control exercised by our management,

 

          ·         the impact of government regulation on our business,

 

          ·         our ability to effectively compete,

 

          ·         the possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property,

 

          ·         the lack of a public market for our securities and the impact of the penny stock rules on trading in our common

                     stock should a public market ever be

                     established.

 

You should read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements including those made in this report, in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other sections of this report include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on these statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and our business.

ALPHA INVESTMENT INC

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

Alpha Investment Inc, formerly GoGo Baby, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on February 22, 2013 under the laws of the State of Delaware to develop, create, manufacture and market, toys for small children which would be designed to attach to car seats and amuse and entertain children during a drive, without distracting the attention of the driver. The Company, however, encountered significant constraints in raising sufficient capital to fully implement its business plan.

 

To better reflecting management’s shifted focus of the Company’s business to real estate and other commercial lending, on March 30, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State changing its name from “Gogo Baby, Inc.” to “Alpha Investment Inc.” The name change and a corresponding change in the Company’s OTC markets trading symbol from GGBY to ALPC received approval from FINRA and became effective as of April 19, 2017.

 

On March 11, 2019, the Company, through Alpha Mortgage Notes I, LLC (the “SPV”) entered into an operating agreement with Alameda Partners LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Alameda Partners”). Alameda Partners acquired a ten percent (10%) equity interest in the SPV in exchange for a payment of $1,000,000 to the Company and is the managing member of the SPV. The capital is intended for use in implementing the Company’s strategy of acquiring commercial real estate performing notes and support other related growth initiatives and assets acquisitions for the Company The principals of Alameda Partners have significant long-term of experience in the commercial real estate industry as property developers, owners, and managers and currently hold over $50 million in commercial real estate assets. Pursuant to the operating agreement for the SPV, Alameda Partners is entitled to monthly distributions in cash or stock equal to $10,000.  As of March 31, 2023, the SPV has not completed any transactions.

 

On July 30, 2020, Alpha entered a joint venture transaction with Parsons Energy Group, LLC (“Parsons”) with respect to leasehold mining rights then held by Parsons on approximately 1,200 acres located in Independence, Wisconsin.

 

On July 21, 2021, the Company and Parsons entered into an Unwinding Agreement (the “Unwinding Agreement”), pursuant to which the joint venture was unwound. Under the Unwinding Agreement, Parsons returned the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the Company for cancellation and the Company assigned the Interest in Legacy Sand back to Parsons and exchanged mutual releases.

 

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN

 

Future issuances of the Company’s equity or debt securities will be required for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a going concern. The Company’s present revenues are insufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $11,056,477 as of March 31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company used $27,827 of cash in operations and incurred a net loss of $115,473. The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company's ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. Securing additional financing, the successful development of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

 

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) which we considered as necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the

 

                                                                   9 

 

                                                                    

Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or the full year.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Alpha Mortgage Notes I, LLC, which is controlled by the Company through its 90% ownership interest, and Paris Med CP-LLC (“Paris Med”), a variable interest entity for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingences. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $297 in cash.

 

Loans Receivable, net and Allowance for Losses

 

The Company records its investments in loans receivable at the lower of cost or fair value. Costs are the gross loan receivables less unamortized costs of issuance and deferred origination fees. Origination fees collected at the time of investment are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized into net interest income over the lives of the related loans. Issuance costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment and amortized against net interest income over the lives of the related loans.

 

When a loan receivable is placed on non-accrual status, the related interest receivable is charged to bad debt of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status, the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest during the non-accrual period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria.

 

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses on its investments in real estate loans receivable for estimated credit impairment.  Management’s estimate of losses is based on several factors including the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, prevailing economic conditions and the underlying collateral securing the loan.  Additions to the allowance are provided through a charge to earnings and are based on an assessment of certain factors, which may indicate estimated losses on the loans.  Actual losses on loans are recorded first as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses.  Generally, subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recognized as income.

 

Estimating allowances for loan losses requires significant judgment about the underlying collateral, including liquidation value, condition of the collateral, competency and cooperation of the related borrower and specific legal issues that affect loan collections or taking possession of the property on an individual loan receivable basis.  Management has no active loans receivable as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

                                                                  10 

 

                                                                    

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 740, "Income Taxes". Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

 

The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 740-10-25, Income Taxes – Overall – Recognition (“ASC Topic 740-10-25”) with respect to the accounting for uncertainty of income tax positions. ASC Topic 740-10-25 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As of March 31, 2024, tax years since 2018 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the Internal Revenue Service for any of the open tax years.

 

Revenue Recognition and Investment Income

 

Origination fees collected at the time of investment are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized into net interest income over the lives of the related loans. Issuance costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment and amortized against net interest income over the lives of the related loans. The Company records interest income in accordance with ASC subtopic 835-30 "Imputation of Interest", using the effective interest method. The Company had no interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, the related interest receivable is charged to bad debt of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status, the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest during the non-accrual period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria.

 

The Company suspends recognizing interest income when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all payments according to the contractual terms of the underlying agreements. Management considers all information available in assessing collectability. Collectability is measured on a receivable-by-receivable basis by either the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective rate, the observable market price for the receivable or the fair value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous receivables, such as pre-settlement funding transactions, are collectively assessed for collectability. Receivables, including those arising from the sale of loan origination services, is charged off when in the Company's judgment, the receivable or portion of the receivable is considered uncollectible.

 

Payments received on past due receivables and finance receivables the Company has suspended recognizing interest income on are applied first to principal and then to accrued interest. Interest income on past due receivables and finance receivables, if received, is recorded when received. The Company generally does not resume recognition of interest income once it has been suspended. At December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated the collectability of its loans and lines of credit receivable, in light of economic conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, established an allowance account to bring these to $0. Accordingly, there is no imputed interest receivable for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.

 

From time to time the Company may make available for use its mailing lists and customer lists to other firms in the same or complimentary markets. For the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company received $1,660 for its lists.

The Company holds a 10% interest in Paris Med, of which the remaining 90% interest is held by Omega.  Through March 31, 2022, the Company has provided 100% of the funding to Paris Med, which has provided a construction loan to a third party.  This loan receivable is the sole asset of Paris Med.  The Company determined that Paris Med was a variable interest entity based on various qualitative and quantitative factors including but not limited to: 1) financing of Paris Med’s sole asset was received by the Company, which is disproportionate to the Company’s ownership interest and 2) the Company and Omega, a related party, organized the entity for the purpose of facilitating the Company’s activities.  As of March 31, 2024, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary because it has provided substantially all of its financial support and is the only party at risk.  As of March 31, 2024, Paris Med has total assets of $0 because the Company established a full reserve for this loan until such time as the loan is repaid. See Note 4.  For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Paris Med had no activity.

 

Fair Value

 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their estimated fair market value based on the short-term maturity of this instrument. The carrying value of the Company’s loans receivable approximate fair value because their terms approximate market rates.

 

Net Loss Per Share

 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. 36,667 shares underlying convertible preferred stock were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, because their impact was anti-dilutive.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable. The Company maintains its cash in bank and financial institution deposits that at times may exceed federally insured limits. 

 

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of the allowance for loan losses, loss contingencies, useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.

 

                                                                  15 

 

                                                                    

Loans Receivable, net and Allowance for Losses

 

The Company records its investments in loans receivable at cost less unamortized costs of issuance and deferred origination fees. Origination fees collected at the time of investment are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized into net interest income over the lives of the related loans. Issuance costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment and amortized against net interest income over the lives of the related loans.

 

When a loan receivable is placed on non-accrual status, the related interest receivable is reversed against interest income of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status, the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest during the non-accrual period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria.

  

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses on its investments in real estate loans receivable for estimated credit impairment.  Management’s estimate of losses is based on a number of factors including the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, prevailing economic conditions and the underlying collateral securing the loan.  Additions to the allowance are provided through a charge to earnings and are based on an assessment of certain factors, which may indicate estimated losses on the loans.  Actual losses on loans are recorded first as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses.  Generally, subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recognized as income.

 

Estimating allowances for loan losses requires significant judgment about the underlying collateral, including liquidation value, condition of the collateral, competency and cooperation of the related borrower and specific legal issues that affect loan collections or taking possession of the property on an individual loan receivable basis.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As of March 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive and financial officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures; as is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of Exchange Act. We recognize that there are material weaknesses related to our internal controls. Therefore, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This includes ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Furthermore, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

                                                                  16 

 

                                                                    

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive and financial officer) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We have designed our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP), and include those policies and procedures that:

 

     ·    pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           disposition of our

           assets;

 

     ·    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in

           accordance with authorization of our management and directors;

           and

 

     ·    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our

           assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive and financial officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

 

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of the end of the period covered in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K. The Chief Executive Officer has concluded that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position and results of operations.

 

This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Chief Executive Officer’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
