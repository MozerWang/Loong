APPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO THE (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF MARCH 31, 2024

 

NOTE A—BUSINESS ACTIVITY

 

AppSoft Technologies (the "Company”) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada March 24, 2015. The Company’s fiscal year-end is December 31st. Appsoft is a developer of innovative games/mobile apps as well as Esports/E-gaming platforms, including Esportsreporter, a leading news channel for all things esports and professional gaming. Coverage includes events with live reporters as well as conducting face-to-face and virtual interviews with professional players in the space. We are currently building a following on digital media to generate revenue from sales, sponsorships, or merchandise from our fanbase and advertisers published on our ad supported content.

 

NOTE B—GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a deficit accumulated of $969,860 and cash used in operations of $13,001 at the period ended March 31, 2024.

 

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months from the date when these financial statements were issued. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise because of this uncertainty.

 

To address these aforementioned, management has undertaken the following initiatives: 1) enter into discussions to secure additional equity funding from current or new shareholders; 2) undertake a program to continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing working capital requirements and minimum expenditure commitments; 3) continue their focus on maintaining an appropriate level of corporate overhead in line with the Company’s available cash resources.

 

NOTE C—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation- The financial statements included herein were prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). All adjustments have been made which in the opinion of management are necessary, normal, and recurring in nature for presentation.

 

Interim filings should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual report as of December 31, 2023.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents- For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

 

Management’s Use of Estimates- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements above reflect all the costs of doing business.

 

Revenue Recognition- On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 (“ASC 606”), requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new revenue standard replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and permits the use of either the full retro30spective or modified retrospective transition method. The Company adopted this standard using the modified basis effective January 1, 2019, and given the Company's limited revenue, the modified retrospective basis has no material impact on prior years given the limited revenue.

 

 

                                                                   6



 

 

APPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO THE (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF MARCH 31, 2024

 

NOTE C—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES—CONT’D

 

 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) - The Company reports Comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to the Company during the period covered in the financial statements.

 

Net Income per Common Share- Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. There was a total of 1,936,000 upon conversion of preferred stock as of March 31, 2024.

 

Deferred Taxes- The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments- The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

 

Accounts Receivable- Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off in the year they become uncollectible. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance in Accounts Receivable was $0 and $0.

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets- The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The Company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Stock-Based Compensation- The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.

 

Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities- The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy 

 

 

                                                                   7

defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 

Level 1   Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

Level 2   Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly

           observable as of the reporting

           date.

Level 3   Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

 

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s note payable approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangement at the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at March 31, 2024, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for the year ended 2024 and early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company does not expect that the guidance will have material impacts on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures. 

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2025 and early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures. 

 

Other pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

NOTE D-SEGMENT REPORTING

 

The Company follows the guidance set forth by section 280-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for reporting and disclosure on operating segments of the Company. It also requires segment disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company determined that it did not have any separately reportable operating segments as of March 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 Series A Cumulative, Convertible Preferred Shares (Preferred Stock) at $.0001 par value per share. During the period from inception (March 24, 2015) through December 31, 2016, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock at $.05 per share to Ventureo, LLC in exchange for $50,000 in cash and Phone Apps with a fair market value of $50,000 for a total of $100,000. The shares of “Preferred Stock” are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.005 per share. The holder of the “Preferred Stock” may not convert any portion of the “Preferred Stock” if, after giving effect to such conversion, the holder would beneficially own in excess of 4.99%, except that the holder may, by written notice to the Company, increase or decrease this percentage up to a maximum of 9.99%, provided that any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company.  Upon a liquidation event, the Company shall first pay to the holders of the “Preferred Stock” an amount per share equal to the Original Issue Price (i.e., $0.05 per share of Series A Preferred Stock), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preference Amount”). After full payment of the liquidation preference amount to the holders of the “Preferred Stock,” the Company will then distribute the remaining assets to holders of common stock, other junior preferred shares (if any) and the “Preferred Stock” on an as-if-converted-basis. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock and senior to any other shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future.

AS OF MARCH 31, 2024

 

NOTE F – INCOME TAX

 

The Company provides for income taxes under (now included under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), 740), Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.

 

ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For Federal income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards that expire through 2030. The net operating loss carry forward as of March 31, 2024 is approximately $969,860 and as of March 31, 2023 is $923,600 approximately. The total deferred tax assets are approximately $204,000 and $194,000 for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements because after evaluating our own potential tax uncertainties, the Company has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that have a greater than 50% likelihood of reversal if the Company were to be audited. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:

 

The Company is not obligated to pay State Income Taxes because it is a Nevada corporation. The Company does not currently have any tax returns open for examination.

 

NOTE G--NOTES PAYABLE AND NOTE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT

 

The total amount of the Notes Payable is $405.643 and bears interest at 2% per year. Interest expense for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1,984 and $1,704, respectively. Total accrued interest as of March 31, 2024 is $29,824.

 

Detail of the Notes Payable is as follows:

 

2018 Notes Payable 

 

2018 Principal and Interest were consolidated into promissory note in the amount of $160,314. The note bears interest at 2% per year. 

 

On November 30, 2018, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with its Creditors under which each Creditor agreed to cancel the Original Notes issued and accept a new promissory note in the amount of $160,314 from the Company evidencing the amount of principal and accrued interest thereon through such date owed to the Creditor that mature on December 31, 2021 in exchange for the Original Notes.

 

In consideration for the exchange of the Original Notes for the New Notes, the Company agreed to reduce the price at which each share of Series A Preferred Stock, of which Ventureo is the sole holder, converts into Common Stock from $0.005 per share to $0.0002 per share. The Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation reflecting the change of the conversion price. The Company’s Board approved the Agreement by unanimous written consent to action on November 30, 2018, and the Majority Holders approved the Agreement by the Stockholder Consent on December 4, 2018. 

 

Although new borrowings are not yet formalized into a note agreement, the Company and the lender agree that the new loans have the same terms and conditions for the formalized notes.

 

2019 Notes Payable

 

In 2019 an additional $42,106 was incurred in promissory notes. The note bears interest at 2% per year.

 

 

                                                                   10

BGS Drawdown Promissory Note

 

On December 31, 2020, the Company executed a Drawdown Promissory Note in favor of Bryan Glass Securities, Inc. (“BGS”) under which the Company is entitled to borrow up to an aggregate of $150,000 during the 2020 and 2021 calendar years (the “Drawdown Note”). The original drawdown amount was $50,000 but has been increased to $150,000 in 2021. Under the Drawdown Note, the Company must request a drawdown against the instrument not less than three days prior to the date on which it requires the proceeds stating the amount of the drawdown and the purposes to which the proceeds will be applied. BGS is entitled to approve or decline an advance of all or a portion of the drawdown request. The unpaid principal amount of the Drawdown Note bears interest at the rate of 2% per year. On October 17, 2022, BGS agreed to extend the maturity date of the Drawdown Note to December 31, 2024. On January 1, 2023, the Drawdown Note amount was increased from $150,000 to $400,000.

 

     ·    During the year 2020, $38,800 of the drawdown was borrowed.

           

     ·    During the year 2021, $62,721 of the drawdown was borrowed.

           

     ·    During the year 2022, $24,775 of the drawdown was borrowed.

           

     ·    During the year 2023, $63,827 of the drawdown was borrowed.

           

     ·    During the 1st quarter of 2024, $13,100 of the drawdown was borrowed.

  

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has borrowed an aggregate of $203,223 from BGS under the Drawdown Note and the sum of $196,777 remains available for advances thereunder.

 

NOTE H—WRITE-OFF OF PAYABLES

 

During the 1st quarter 2023, management has asked legal counsel to render an opinion with respect to the collectability of an outstanding Payable carried on the books since July 2015. Reference:  Laws governing the statute of limitations relating to contractual obligations in Nevada are set forth in Title 2, Civil Practice, Chapter 11, of the Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”), entitled “Limitations of Actions,” comprising NRS 11.190 through NRS 11.250. 

 

With respect to contractual obligations, under Nevada law, a plaintiff must commence an action permitted at law within the specific time period allotted under Chapter 11 of the NRS. If the action is not brought within the allotted time period, the defendant may assert a defense that the of limitations. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense in which the defendant introduces evidence, which, if found to be credible, will negate criminal or civil liability, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts. The party raising the affirmative defense has the burden of proof on establishing that it applies. In a civil action in which a creditor demands payment on a written instrument evidencing a debt, the successful assertion of the statute of limitations defense will bar collection of the debt. In order to assert the statute of limitations as a defense, a defendant must specifically assert the defense in its answer. If a defendant fails to specifically plead the defense, it will be deemed to be waived. Since no action to enforce such liabilities was brought before December 31, 2022, it is our opinion that the Liability is time-barred from collection under the laws of Nevada and may be removed from the Company’s current balance sheet. 

 

Given the foregoing, the following existing liabilities would be time barred by the statute of limitations:

 

Nature of Liability   Amount    Date Created   Written Instrument                   Maturity Date                     Date on which

                                                                                                                       Statute of

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Forward Looking Statements

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Report.

 

The information in this discussion and elsewhere in this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “may,” “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “could,” “estimate,” “continue” and similar expressions or variations identify forward-looking statements.

 

Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to:

 

     ·    Our failure to develop or acquire and publish new Apps that achieve market acceptance or we do not continue to enhance our

           existing

           Apps.

     ·    Our inability to maintain a good relationship with the markets where our Apps are distributed.

     ·    Our inability to keep pace with technological changes and market conditions in the Apps industry.

     ·    Our inability to compete against a wide range of companies that market Apps, many of which have significantly greater

           resources than we

           do.

     ·    Our ability to obtain financing as and when needed on acceptable terms.

 

We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

 

Overview

 

We develop, publish and market Apps for smartphones and tablet devices and own and operate Esportsreporter.com, a news channel for esports enthusiasts. We derive revenue from sales, or downloads, of our Apps and from advertisements published on our ad-supported game titles and from advertisements published on Esportsreporter.com. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we did not generate any revenue. During the period, we focused our development efforts on our esports segments. Over the course of 2024, we will seek to generate revenue from the sale of software titles that we are developing through our Gamerfy App development website and from paid advertisements published on Esportsreporter.com as we seek to re-launch the site with more focus on video gameplay.

 

Our Apps titles include games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of consumers. We offer all of our game titles in both a free advertisement-supported version and a paid version that does not display ads. We believe that the ad supported versions allow for wider dissemination of our titles to consumers who might not otherwise spend money for an App without first playing the game.

 

 

                                                                   13



 

 

We market, sell and distribute our games through as Apple’s App Store, a direct-to-consumer digital storefront. We currently expect to advertise our Apps through the digital storefronts, our own website, social media, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, through mobile ad networks and search engine optimization, or SEO, tools.

 

We expect to develop and acquire new Apps to expand our existing product offerings, as our resources permit. We rely on third party designers, developers and programs to develop new Apps. We also solicit ideas for new titles from unrelated parties. We evaluate prospects based on a variety of factors. If we conclude that a particular prospect is worth pursuing, we may fund the development of the App through launch and beyond.

 

We have been growing our Esports efforts from a simple news site to in-depth interviews with current and former champions, and now we are moving into video gameplay content.

 

We have been constrained in our development and acquisition activities by a lack of cash. Our ability to pursue and achieve our objectives is predicated on our receipt of meaningful revenue from sales of our existing Apps and those we may release in the future and from our ability to raise capital from outside sources.

 

Growth Strategies and Outlook

 

Our principal growth strategy entails developing and acquiring new Apps to supplement our existing Apps portfolio. Our primary focus will be to release new game titles. We seek to solicit new games and concepts that we may acquire from third parties. We also will seek to develop and publish free-to-play games. Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee, through “in-app purchases” utilizing virtual currency that may be purchased through digital storefronts, and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenues for us. We may seek to acquire franchises around which we develop games, including movies, television programs, toys and other cultural phenomena that lend themselves to gamification.

 

During the first quarter of 2022, we launched a video game incubator, Gamerfy.com, which will seek to acquire and commercialize the next generation of game titles with particular focus on community play, the Metaverse and NFT’s, each of which would allow us to sell into rapidly growing market segments. We expect Gamerfy to be the principal source of new games for us for the foreseeable future. We have identified a heuristics process for investment decisions and have identified key professionals for employment and as executive members of Gamerfy.

 

During the second quarter of 2021, we launched Esportsreporter.com, a news channel for a broad spectrum of esports and gaming. We are currently building a following on digital media and expect to monetize the site and our audience utilizing an array of proven techniques, including generating revenue from sales, sponsorships, merchandise, and advertiser supported content. We expect to direct a significant percentage of our capital resources on Esportsreporter.com during 2024.

 

Our revenues will depend significantly on growth in the mobile games market and our ability to develop or acquire and publish Apps that are well-received by consumers. In addition, because our products are purchased with disposable income, our success is dependent on the overall strength of the economy in the United States. We expect to invest resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce new Apps and continue to update our existing Apps, and to the extent that Apps into which we have invested significant capital are not successful, our business and financial condition could be harmed. We operate in an environment that is extremely competitive for users against a continually increasing number of developers, many of which are significantly larger than us and have other competitive advantages. We expect to allocate a material portion of our operating revenue and capital that we receive to sales and marketing initiatives in connection with the launch and promotion of our games in an effort to drive sales.

 

Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend not only on our ability to generate meaningful our revenues, but also on our ability to manage our operating expenses. Currently, we have one full-time employee, who receives compensation when and as determined by the Board. For the foreseeable further, we expect to utilize the services of independent contractors and consultants, who we believe are readily available for our purposes, in order to manage our personnel costs. We also will continue to maintain a virtual office as long as our operations permit us to do so to control our office space overhead.

 

 

                                                                   14



 

 

We require significant additional capital to fund the development of new Apps and to enhance our Esportsreporter site and to promote our products. We cannot be sure that the additional capital we require will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products, take advantage of future opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.

 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 (unaudited)

 

During the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not engage in substantive business operations, did not generate any revenue and had minimal assets. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred operating expenses of $14,986, consisting principally of professional fees in connection with satisfying its reporting obligations under federal securities law and interest expenses, and suffered a net loss of $14,986, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023 in which the Company incurred operating expenses of $27,068 and suffered a net loss of $27,068.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, the availability of credit facilities, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.

 

Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund the development and acquisition of new Apps, to develop and promote our Esports platform, for sales and marketing initiatives in connection with the launch and promotion of our games and platforms, and for working capital to fund our general corporate needs, including filing reports under the federal securities laws.

 

Since our customers pay for their purchases by credit or debit card at the time of sale, neither inventories nor receivables are relevant to our business.

 

Since our inception, we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, from third party loans and from internally generated revenue from operations.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of $29,418, compared to a working capital deficit of $27,831 at December 31, 2023.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we borrowed an aggregate of $13,100 under a drawdown promissory note that entitles us to borrow up to $400,000, which bears interest at the rate of 2% per year borrowings and which matures on December 31, 2027. As of March 31, 2024, we had borrowed an aggregate of $203,223 under the drawdown and the sum of $196,777 remains available for advances.

 

We do not have any cash on hand and we have not generated meaningful cash flow from operations sufficient to support our operations. As described above, we have been borrowing cash to fund our operations. We require significant cash to effectuate all of our desired game development and Esports platform strategies. We will continue to rely on borrowings from third party loans. However, our future operations are dependent on our ability to secure significant additional financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities or through other financing mechanisms. However, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to secure such financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital may continue to restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.

 

 

                                                                   15



 

 

Cash Flows:

 

Operating Activities

 

We used net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of $13,100 compared to $16,023 for the 2023 period, in each case consisting principally of payments to outside consultants, developers and programmers and payments to web hosting and email hosting providers. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was the result of our limited cash resources to deploy to our operations.

 

Financing Activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $13,100 compared to $16,023 during the 2023 period. In each year, financing was provided by loans to the Company. We utilized all of the proceeds that we received from the borrowings for working capital.

 

Contractual Commitments as of March 31, 2023

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no contractual obligations, as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

Going Concern

 

The notes to our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a deficit accumulated of $969,860 at March 31, 2024. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise because of this uncertainty

 

The presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph suggests that we may not have sufficient liquidity, or minimum cash levels, to operate our business. Since our inception, we have incurred losses and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until such time as our Apps generate sufficient revenue to offset our research and development, general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our near-term operational plans described elsewhere in this report. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our operational plans. We cannot be sure that the additional capital we require will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products, take advantage of future opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.

 

Off-Balance Sheet and Other Arrangements

 

We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

Inflation

 

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

 

The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

 

                                                                   16



 

 

The Company believes that its significant accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note C to our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. We do not believe that there has been any significant change in the Company’s critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

Emerging Growth Company Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure: We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

 

See Note C to the financial statements furnished with this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the financial statements presented herein.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives.

 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and who we refer to herein as our PEO, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s PEO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review.

 

Management is in the process of determining how best to address this condition and implement a more effective system to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. Our management acknowledges the existence of this problem, and intends to developed procedures to address them to the extent possible given limitations in financial and manpower resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation of such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented.

 

Changes in Internal Controls

 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
