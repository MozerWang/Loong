Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

Note 1 – Nature of Business and Liquidity

Organization

Crown Electrokinetics Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 20, 2015. Effective October 6, 2017, the Company’s name was changed to Crown Electrokinetics Corp. from 3D Nanocolor Corp. (“3D Nanocolor”).

The Company is commercializing technology for smart or dynamic glass. The Company’s electrokinetic glass technology is an advancement on microfluidic technology that was originally developed by HP Inc.

On December 20, 2022, the Company incorporated Crown Fiber Optics Corp., a Delaware based entity, to own and operate its acquired business from the acquisition of Amerigen 7, LLC (“Amerigen 7”) in January 2023. Crown Fiber Optics Corp. is accounted for as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown Electrokinetics, Corp.

Initial Public Offering

On January 26, 2021, the Company completed its public offering, and its common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol CRKN.

Reverse Stock Split

On August 11, 2023, the Company’s board of directors authorized a reverse stock split (‘Reverse Stock Split”) at an exchange ratio of one-for-60 basis. The Reverse Stock Split was effective on August 15, 2023, such that every 60 shares of common stock have been automatically converted into one share of common stock. The Company did not issue fractional certificates for post-reverse split shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Rather, all shares of common stock that were held by a stockholder were aggregated and each stockholder was entitled to receive the number of whole shares resulting from the combination of the shares so aggregated. Any fractions resulting from the Reverse Stock Split computation were rounded up to the next whole share.

The number of authorized shares and the par value of the common stock was not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the conversion ratio for the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock was proportionately adjusted such that the common stock issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock was decreased in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split. All references to common stock and options to purchase common stock share data, per share data and related information contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.

Liquidity and Going Concern

The Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $121.6 million and cash of approximately $0.3 million as of March 31, 2024, a net loss of approximately $4.6 million, and approximately $2.7 million of net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The Company has obtained additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations including through its existing at-the-market offering, and $50.0 million equity line of credit; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the

Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the periods presented.

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, the condensed consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period presented. The financial data and the other financial information contained in these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements related to the three month periods are also unaudited. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other future annual or interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Accounting estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but not limited to, valuation of its business combination, estimated fair value of convertible notes, estimated fair value of warrant liability, Series F/F-1/F-2 preferred stock, stock option awards for stock-based compensation and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as Israel and Hamas. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Reference is made to Note 3 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2024 for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process:

•Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer

•Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

•Step 3: Determine the transaction price

•Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

•Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

The Company has elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the time between the goods or service being transferred to the customer and the customer pays is one year or less,

The Company generates revenue from providing fiber splicing services as required based on short-term work orders assigned by customers. The Company is required to complete the description of work described in the work order and test the service provided prior to any recognition of revenue and invoicing. The short-term work orders are generally completed within two weeks. The Company is required to adhere to the rules and regulations that are outlined in the Agreement between the Company and the Customer.

Cost of revenue is based on individual work orders and detailed description of work to be performed. All of the revenue is recognized immediately upon completion of each work order. A 5% retainage will be withheld by the Customer upon payment of invoices and will be paid to the Company within one year after termination of the contract. The retainage can be utilized by Customer for any claims that may arise after work is completed up through one year after completion.

Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was generated by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Crown Fiber Optics Corporation, and was $0.7 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, revenue generated was approximately $22,000.

Segment and Reporting Unit Information

Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is determined to be the CODM. The Company has two operating segments and two reportable segments as of March 31, 2024, which includes film group and fiber optics group. Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 relates to the fiber optics group.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts.

Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets. Although the Company believes the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets we have acquired include future expected cash flows from customer contracts. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. The initial purchase price may be adjusted as needed per the terms of the arrangement agreement. The allocation of purchase price, including any fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date has not been completed.

Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

The Company accounts for debt issuance costs related to its line of credit and equity line of credit as a deferred asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which is amortized over the life of the line of credit and equity line of credit. Since the Company has elected the fair value option for its convertible notes (see Note 10), upon a draw down, a portion of the deferred asset balance will be amortized and recognized as other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. On the issuance date of the Company’s line of credit, the cost related to issuance of the Series E preferred shares and the warrant to purchase Series E preferred shares was recorded as a deferred asset. On the issuance date of the Company’s equity line of credit, the cost related to issuance of common stock was recorded as a deferred asset.

Notes Payable at Fair Value

The Company has elected the fair value option for the recognition of its convertible notes and notes payable, with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations. As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible notes and notes payable are recognized in other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company includes the interest expense as a component of the notes fair value. 

Warrants 

The Company accounts for certain common stock warrants outstanding as a liability at fair value and adjusts the fair value of the instruments at each reporting period. The liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants issued by the Company was estimated using the Black-Scholes model.

SLOC

The Company accounts for its warrants related to the SLOC as stockholders’ equity, and therefore, the warrants are not revalued after issuance. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value the warrants at issuance.

As of March 31, 2024, since no loan amounts were drawn down, the SLOC warrant is recorded as a deferred asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and will be amortized over the life of the SLOC. Upon a draw down, the remaining balance of the deferred asset would be reclassified to debt discount and amortized under the effective interest method over the one-year term of the loan.

Purchase Order Warrants

On August 12, 2022, the Company entered into two Purchase Orders (PO’s) with Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. (“Hudson”) for the purchase of the Company’s Smart Window Inserts™ (“Inserts”). The PO’s have a value of $0.1 million and represent the first orders the Company has received prior to the launch of its Inserts. As additional consideration for the PO’s, the Company issued a warrant to Hudson to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $45.00 per share. The warrant has a five-year life and expires on August 12, 2027.



Because Hudson is a customer, the Company accounts for the PO’s and warrants under ASC 606. As the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied, the Company has not recognized any revenue in connection with Hudson during the year ended March 31, 2024.



The Company measured the fair value of the warrant using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the issuance date, with the value being recognized as a prepaid asset up to the recoverable value represented by the value of the contract.

The fair value of the warrant on the issuance date totaled $0.2 million, and as of March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a prepaid asset of $0.1 million, representing the recoverable value from the PO’s, which is included in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed using the sum of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and the effect of dilutive securities.

As the Company was in a net loss position for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.

Securities that could potentially dilute loss per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share at March 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

Warranty Customer Liability



The Company provides warranties depending on the terms of the arrangement with the customer. This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and conditions. It is applicable to projects completed by Crown's fiber optics segment, which includes services provided by Crown Fiber Optics Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown. The standard warranty period ranges for up to two years from the project completion date. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of the cost of revenues at the time the revenue is recognized based on historical experience and any current known trends that might affect future costs. Total warranty expense recognized during the period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $36,000 and $nil, respectively.



Retainage



The Company’s customers have a contractual right to withhold payment of a retainage amount, typically 5%. The retainage can be utilized by customers for any claims that may arise after work is completed through one year after project completion. The retainage amount is recorded as an accounts receivable in the balance sheet and is expected to be collected upon the project's completion and acceptance by the customer. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a retainage receivable of $0.1 million and zero, respectively, which is included in the accounts receivable balance in the condensed consolidated balance sheet



Note 3 – Acquisitions

On January 3, 2023, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed liabilities from Amerigen 7, which was accounted for as a business combination as the Company concluded that the transferred set of activities and assets related to the acquisition constituted a business. The Company paid cash consideration of approximately $0.7 million which included approximately 12 employees, customer contracts, and certain operating liabilities.

The Company engaged an independent valuation specialist to conduct a valuation analysis of the identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company with the objective of estimating the fair value of such assets as of January 3, 2023. The valuation specialist utilized the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, to value the existing customer relationship.



During the year ended December 31, 2023, all the acquired assets and assumed liabilities that relate to the original Amerigen7 acquisition were written off and all the key employees terminated. Due to these key qualitative changes to the Fiber Optics Group after the acquisition, the Company concluded that the goodwill balance associated with the Amerigen7 acquisition was fully impaired as there were no future expected cash flows from the acquired Amerigen7 business. The Company has no goodwill balance as of March 31, 2024.

Note 9 - Contracts with Customers and Revenue Concentration



Concentration of Credit Risk and Accounts Receivable



Crown Electrokinetics Corp. assesses and monitors the creditworthiness of its customers continually and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had accounts receivable of $776,000, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, compared to $83,000 as of December 31, 2023. The significant increase in receivables is primarily due to increased activity in fiber splicing services and extended payment terms offered to certain customers.



No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the net accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2024, and no significant concentrations of credit risk were noted.



Deferred Revenue and Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations



13





As of March 31, 2024, Crown Electrokinetics Corp. has recorded deferred revenue totaling $1.3 million. This amount represents the advance payments received under the Fixed Price Construction Agreement with Vista Serena, S. de R.L. de C.V., dated March 1, 2024. The contract stipulates the construction of two slant wells at Santa Maria Bay, with Crown Fiber Optics Corp. serving as the contractor.



The total contract price is $3.6 million, of which an advance payment of $1.3 million collected as of March 31, 2024. The revenue associated with this project is expected to be recognized as Crown Fiber Optics Corp. fulfills its performance obligations under the contract, specifically as construction milestones are completed in accordance with the agreed project schedule.



Approximately $2.3 million of the contract price is anticipated to be recognized within the next 12 months as construction progresses. This projection includes considerations for potential adjustments such as material changes or force majeure events that could alter the timing of revenue recognition. The remaining balance will be recognized as the final stages of the project are completed, with the entire project expected to be finalized by the date specified in the project schedule, unless modifications are necessitated by unforeseen circumstances as outlined in the agreement. Revenue is expected to be recognized based on the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion, following the percentage of completion method.

The Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 there was a increase of approximately $23,000 in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value.



The Company uses significant unobservable inputs to value its Level 3 liabilities, which include warrants to purchase shares of common stock. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The key factors considered in this model are:



•Dividend Yield: The expected dividend yield is based on the Company's historical dividend payments and future expectations. As of March 31, 2024, the dividend yield used was 0.0%.



•Expected Price Volatility: The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the warrants. As of March 31, 2024, the expected price volatility was 70.0%. 



•Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity similar to the expected term of the warrants. As of March 31, 2024, the risk-free interest rate was 4.33%.



•Expected Term: The expected term of the warrants is based on the remaining contractual life of the warrants. As of March 31, 2024, the expected term was 3.8 years.



2022 Convertible Notes at Fair Value

The fair value of the 2022 Notes on the issuance dates, and as of March 31, 2024 were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to capture the path dependencies intrinsic to their terms. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s convertible notes are the common stock price, volatility, and risk-free interest rates.

Litigation

From time to time, the Company is also involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish the Company’s proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.

As an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay our adoption of such new or revised accounting standards. As a result of this election, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the condensed financial statements of other public companies.

Overview

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 20, 2015. Effective October 6, 2017, our name was changed to Crown Electrokinetics Corp. from 3D Nanocolor Corp.

On January 26, 2021, we completed our public offering, and our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol CRKN.

We commercialize technology for smart or dynamic glass. Our electrokinetic glass technology is an advancement on microfluidic technology that was originally developed by HP Inc.

On December 20, 2022, we incorporated Crown Fiber Optics Corp., a Delaware based entity, to own and operate our acquired business from the acquisition of Amerigen 7, LLC (“Amerigen 7”) in January 2023. Crown Fiber Optics Corp. is accounted for as our wholly- owned subsidiary.

Reverse Stock Split

On August 11, 2023, our board of directors authorized a reverse stock split (‘Reverse Stock Split”) at an exchange ratio of one-for-60 basis. The number of authorized shares and the par value of the common stock was not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the conversion ratio for our outstanding preferred stock was proportionately adjusted such that the common stock issuable upon conversion of such preferred stock was decreased in proportion to the Reverse Stock Split. All references to common stock and options to purchase common stock share data, per share data and related information contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.

Revenue

Revenue is solely generated by Crown Fiber Optics, and was $0.7 million and $22,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue of $0.7 million is due to new contracts the Company entered into with new subcontractors in the first quarter of 2024.

Cost of Revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization

Cost of revenue is solely generated by Crown Fiber Optics, and was $1.6 million and $31,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue of $1.6 million is due to increases in compensation related to cost of sales of $0.5 million, insurance of $0.2 million, subcontractor labor of $$0.4 million, equipment cost of $0.3 million and other costs related to supplies, materials and maintenance of $0.2 million.



Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023, were $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 

33





Research and Development



Research and development expenses were $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase of $0.3 million is primarily related to an increase in salaries and benefits of $0.1 million and further by an increase in stock compensation of $0.2 million.



General and Administrative



General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $1.8 million and $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $1.6 million decrease in G&A expenses is primarily due to decrease in compensation and benefits related to wages of $0.6 million, decrease in professional fees of $0.4 million, decrease in rent expense of $0.1 million and decrease in other expenses of $0.5 million.



Interest expense



Interest expense were $0.9 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $1.1 million is primarily related to a decrease in amortization of deferred asset related to the Company's standby letter of credit and equity line of credit.



Loss on extinguishment of warrant liability



Loss on extinguishment of warrant liability were $nil and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease is primarily due to warrant exercises in prior quarter and none in the current quarter.



Change in fair value of warrants



Change in fair value of warrants were $23,000 and $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease of $5.6 million is primarily due to change in fair value of warrants that were recorded in prior quarter and none for the current quarter.



Change in fair value of notes



Change in fair value of notes were $nil and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The $0.1 million recorded in prior quarter was primarily related to record of note issuances.



Other Income (Expense)



Other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $24,000 compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease of $1.2 million is due to a decrease in amortization expense reclass as well as other warrant issuances in connection with a waiver agreement.

We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $121.6 million, and a net loss of $4.6 million, and used approximately $2.7 million in net cash in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. We expect to continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses, including public company expenses.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company participated in an At-the-Market (ATM) offering, where a total of 4,824,382 shares of common stock were sold. The total gross proceeds from the sales amounted to $0.6 million, out 

34





of which $28,000 were deducted for commissions and other offering expenses. Consequently, the net proceeds received by the Company from the ATM offering totaled $0.6 million.

In connection with our Equity Line of Credit (ELOC), the Company issued 21,133,689 shares of common stock. The gross proceeds from this issuance totaled $1.6 million, associated issuance fees amounted to $0.1 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.4 million. This facility continues to provide flexible financing options to support the Company’s growth initiatives and operational needs.



On January 3, 2023, we received net proceeds of $1.0 million from the issuance of senior secured notes with a principal balance of $1.2 million and a debt discount of $0.2 million.



On February 2, 2023, we withdrew $2.0 million under the Line of Credit. Upon drawing down on the Line of Credit, we issued the LOC Note which is due and payable 60 days from the issuance date.



On April 4th, 2023, we made a $0.3 million payment on the LOC balance.



On May 16, 2023, we made a second draw of $0.2 million under the line of credit. Upon drawing down on the line of credit, we issued the 2nd LOC Note which was due and payable July 16, 2023. The 2nd LOC Note shall accrue interest at the 15% per annum from the original funding date of the 2nd LOC Note.



On May 26, 2023, we made a third draw of $0.2 million under the line of credit. Upon drawing down on the line of credit, we issued a third Secured Promissory Note (the “3rd LOC Note”) which became due and payable June 2, 2023. The 3rd LOC Note included a $0.2 million commitment fee and does not bear interest.



On June 13, 2023, we partially redeemed the principal of the LOC Note and fully redeemed the principal of the 2nd LOC Note and the 3rd LOC Note in addition to all accrued interest and commitment fees owing for approximately $2.1 million.



On July 25, 2023, we entered into the Demand Secured Promissory Note Agreement (“Q3 Demand Notes”) with two investors for a purchase price of $20,000 each and with an original issue discount of $12,000. Upon settlement, we are obligated to pay a total of $0.1 million in principle for the issuance of both notes. The Q3 Demand Notes were due and payable at any time upon demand by the holder after the earlier of (i) the consummation of our first securities offering after the issuance of the Q3 Demand Notes and (ii) August 25, 2024.



We have obtained additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements including through our existing ATM Offering, and the ELOC to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in our ability to raise capital, we believe that there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the SEC rules and regulations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 

There are certain critical estimates that require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:



•it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made; and



•changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.



Our accounting estimates, specifically related to the impairment of long-lived assets and share-based compensation, play a crucial role in our financial reporting. Despite our thorough assessment, we have not identified any recent events or conditions necessitating revisions to our estimates and assumptions that would materially impact the carrying values of our assets or liabilities as of this Form 10-Q’s issuance date. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.

JOBS Act Transition Period

As an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth 

36





company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay our adoption of such new or revised accounting standards. As a result of this election, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the condensed financial statements of other public companies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Not required for a smaller reporting company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, relating to our company, including our consolidated subsidiaries.



Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives.



Our management, including our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures.



Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



37





Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management is committed to accurate and ethical business practices. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.



Management noted the following deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses:



•Lack of documentation of processes and controls at the level appropriate for a public company;

•Inadequate design of information technology general and application controls over certain operating systems and system applications supporting financial reporting processes;

•Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes; and

•Ineffective risk assessment controls, due to a lack of documentation of management’s periodic risk assessment. 

Management’s view is that unethical, illegal, or inaccurate conduct in the operations and accounting for our company violates the trust and integrity of our company and is damaging to the interests of all stakeholders, and in the long-term misconduct injures the interests of even the individual whom it might initially benefit. This is reinforced periodically with informal conversations and is ingrained in the culture of our company. When questions arise, they are escalated to the CFO, CEO, or Board of Directors for review, investigation, direction, and consensus, and external opinion is sought if consensus is not achieved. The Senior Vice President of Accounting and CFO both have direct contact with all levels of review. Management intends to work internally and with third parties to ensure we have the proper controls in place going forward.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are also involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
