NOTES REGARDING OUR COMPANY

 

Forward Looking Statements

 

This periodic report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of management. Statements in this periodic report that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this Quarterly Report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company’s stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company’s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management’s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:

 

Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.

 

This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements are illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

 

Disclosures Related to Our Chinese Operations

 

China Foods Holdings Ltd. (the “Company”, “CFOO”, or “we”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 10, 2019. The Company is a Delaware holding company and we conduct our primary operations in China through our wholly owned subsidiary Guangzhou Xiao Xiang Health Industry Company Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of China on March 8, 2017 (“GXXHIC”). GXXHIC is wholly owned by Alpha Wellness (HK) Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Hong Kong on April 24, 2019, which is in turn wholly owned by Elite Creation Group, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands formed on September 5, 2018. Alpha Wellness (HK) Limited and Elite Creation Group are holding companies without operations and are wholly owned by the Company.

 

Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and are governed by Chinese laws, rules and regulations. Our subsidiary, GXXHIC, is subject to Chinese laws, rules, and regulations. Uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice and that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities.

 

We do not believe there GXXHIC is in violation of any laws, rules or regulations but since these newly enacted rules are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our business operations comply with such regulations and authorities’ requirements in all respects during the development of these new rules. However, in terms of business operation, GXXHIC expects to adapt to the newly issued rules and take dependent measures to comply with the laws and regulations of the Chinese authorities. The People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) government’s authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings and listings conducted overseas by, and foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors. Implementation of industry-wide regulations in this nature may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and quickly evolving rules and regulations in China, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. But so far, the current operation and securities value of CFOO are stable, and we believe that its risks are to the Company are manageable.

 

GXXHIC has received a Business License from the relevant department of the State Administration for Market Regulation. Apart from the Business License, GXXHIC may be subject to additional licensing requirements for our business operation due to the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant government authorities.

 

For more information on these risks and other risks relating to our company, please see our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

 

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”), was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA requires that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) determine whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. Our auditor, ARK Pro CPA & Co (formerly HKCM & CPA Co.), is based in Hong Kong and is subject to the determinations announced by the PCOAB on December 16, 2021 and the HFCAA. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB reported its determination that it was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC and Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. On March 30, 2022, based on this determination, the Company was transferred to the SEC’s “Conclusive list of issuers identified under the HFCA.” Since our auditor is located in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB. The HFCAA states that if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for two consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. The related risks and uncertainties could cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of presentation and consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting, and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on April 16, 2024.

 

                                                                   7



                                                         

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas for which management uses estimates include:

 

●    revenue recognition at point in time and over time;

●    sales returns at point in time and allowances;

●    inventory;

●    estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets; and

●    income tax valuation allowances

 

These estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary.

 

Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.

 

Accounts receivable

 

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest, which are due within contractual payment terms, generally 30 to 90 days from completion of service. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer’s financial condition, the customer credit-worthiness and their payment history. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. At the end of fiscal year, the Company specifically evaluates individual customer’s financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to monitor the progress of the collection of accounts receivables. The Company will consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts.

 

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Credit Losses – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASC 326), the Company utilizes the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model to determine an allowance that reflects its best estimate of the expected credit losses on accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits and other receivables which is recorded as a liability to offset the receivables. The CECL model is prepared after considering historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses. Accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for expected credit losses.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value), cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include material and manufacturing overhead costs. The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories, nor have there been any write-offs.

 

                                                                   8



                                                         

 

Plant and equipment

 

Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking into account their estimated residual values:

 SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

                                                    Expected useful lives                               Residual value              

Furniture, fixture and equipment                    3 years                                                                       5%

Motor vehicle                                       3.33 to 4 years                                                               5%

Leasehold improvement                               2 years                                                                       5%

 

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.

 

Depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $56 and $14,351, respectively.

 

Intangible assets

 

Intangible assets represented trademarks of their products and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and any recognized impairment loss. Amortization is provided over the term of their registrations on a straight-line basis, which is 10 years and will expire in 2028.

 

Amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $117 and $123, respectively.

 

Impairment of long-lived assets

 

In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, all long-lived assets such as plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. There has been no impairment charge for the periods presented.

 

Revenue recognition

 

The Company adopted ASC 606 – “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC Topic 606”). Under ASC Topic 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under the standard, a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps:

 

     ●    identify the contract with a customer;

     ●    identify the performance obligations in the contract;

     ●    determine the transaction price;

     ●    allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and

     ●    recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.

 

                                                                   9



                                                         

 

Currently, the Company operates two business segments.

 

Healthcare Business mainly provides health consulting advisory services and healthcare and wellness products to the customers.

 

Revenue is earned from the rendering of health consulting advisory services to the customers. The Company recognizes services revenue over the period in which such services are performed. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.

 

The sale and distribution of the healthcare products, such as (i) Nutrition Catering (ii) Special Health Food (iii) Health Supplement and (iv) Skincare, is the only performance obligation under the fixed-fee arrangements. Revenue is recognized from the sale of their healthcare products upon delivery to the customers, whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred to the customers. The Company records its revenues, net of value added taxes (“VAT”) on the majority of the products at the rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales. The cost, such as shipping cost and material cost, is recognized when the product delivered to the customers. The Company records its cost including taxes.

 

Wine Business mainly provides wine products to the customers, with a right to return. The Company acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and as such, generally records revenues on a gross basis. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities. Revenue is recognized from the sale of wine products upon delivery to the customers, whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred to the customers. The Company records its revenues, net of value added taxes (“VAT”) on the majority of the products at the rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales. The revenues are presented net of sales returns and discounts. The Company recorded no product sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The cost, such as shipping cost and material cost, is recognized when the product delivered to the customers. The Company records its cost including taxes.

Income taxes

 

The Company adopted the ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”) provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.

 

The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.

 

Foreign currencies translation

 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

 

The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollar (“US$”) and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company is operating in Hong Kong SAR and the PRC and maintain its books and record in its local currency, Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”) and Renminbi (“RMB”), which is a functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted. In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.

 

Translation of amounts from HK$ and RMB into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

Net loss per share

 

The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share”. Basic (loss) income per share is computed by dividing the net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted (loss) income per share is computed similar to basic (loss) income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Potential common stocks that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

 

                                                                   11



                                                         

 

Comprehensive income

 

ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income”, establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.

 

Retirement plan costs

 

Contributions to retirement plans (which are defined contribution plans) are charged to general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operation as the related employee service are provided.

 

Leases

 

The Company adopts the FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842).” for all periods presented. This standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets (“right of use”) and related lease obligations (“lease liabilities”) on the balance sheet for leases with terms in excess of 12 months.

 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in finance lease ROU assets and finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

 

ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. In cases where the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Related parties

 

The Company follows the ASC Topic 850-10, “Related Party” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.

 

Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.

 

                                                                   12



                                                         

 

The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

 

Commitments and contingencies

 

The Company follows the ASC Topic 450-20, “Commitments” to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

 

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.

 

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

 

Fair value Measurement

 

The Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC Topic 820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

 

          Level 1        Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting

                          date.

          Level 2        Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or

                          indirectly observable as of the reporting

                          date.

          Level 3        Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

 

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

 

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other payables, and customer deposits approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

 

                                                                   13



                                                         

 

Segment Reporting

 

ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in Hong Kong and China.

 

Recent accounting pronouncements

 

Accounting Standards Recently Adopted

 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance. This standard became effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2022. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2022, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This ASU clarifies the accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (i.e. warrants) so that the transaction should be treated as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2022, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. This ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848, which provides relief to entities affected by reference rate reform. The ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2025. The standard is effective immediately and the Company adopted the standard in December 2022 with no financial impact. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2020-04, for which this ASU 2022-06 relates, will have on its consolidated financial statements.

 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

 

NOTE 3 – LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $61,661 and suffered from a working capital deficit of $470,231 as of March 31, 2024. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company’s obligations as they become due. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.

 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

 

NOTE 4 – SEGMENT REPORTING

 

Currently, the Company has two reportable business segments:

 

(i)       Healthcare Segment, mainly provides health consulting advisory services and healthcare and wellness products to the

           customers;

           and

(ii)      Wine Segment, mainly provides the wine products to the customers.

 

                                                                   14

Common Stock

 

The Company is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001.

 

Dividend Rights

 

Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.

 

Voting Rights

 

Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors.

 

No Preemptive or Similar Rights

 

Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.

 

Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions

 

Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a total of 20,252,309 and 20,252,309 outstanding shares of common stock were issued, respectively.

Preferred Stock

 

The Company is not currently authorized to issue shares of preferred stock. The Certificate of Incorporation however, allows the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock in the event that shares of preferred stock are authorized in the future. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. The Company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

 

NOTE 12 – NET LOSS PER SHARE

 

Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding is included in diluted net loss per share. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic and diluted                                 20,252,309               20,252,309 

                                                                                                                                   

Net loss per share – Basic and diluted                                             $                (0.00)  $                (0.01)

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding is equal to basic weighted-average common shares, due to the Company’s net loss position. Hence, no common stock equivalents were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share since such inclusion would have been antidilutive.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision. There were no reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and no accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. With some exceptions, most tax years remain open to examination by the taxing authorities due to the Company’s NOL carryforwards.

 

NOTE 14 – PENSION COSTS

 

The Company is required to make contributions to their employees under a government-mandated defined contribution pension scheme for its eligible full-times employees in the People’s Republic of China and mandatory provident funds for its eligible full-times employees in the Hong Kong. The Company is required to contribute a specified percentage of the participants’ relevant income based on their ages and wages level. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, $14,007 and $3,703 contributions were made accordingly.

 

NOTE 15 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

From time to time, the Company’s director and related company advanced funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owed the balance of $232,585 and $232,344 to its director, and owed the balance of $319,567 and $320,315 to a related company.

 

Apart from the transactions and balances detailed elsewhere in these accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has no other significant or material related party transactions during the periods presented.

 

                                                                   20



                                                         

 

NOTE 16 – CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

 

The Company is exposed to the following concentrations of risk:

 

(a) Major customers

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, No vendor represented more than 10% of the Company’s sales.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, a single customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s revenues. This customer accounted for 85% of the Company’s revenues amounting to $10,347.

 

(b) Major vendors

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, No vendor represented more than 10% of the Company’s purchases.

 

All of the Company’s vendors are located in the PRC.

  

(c) Credit risk

 

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The Company believes the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.

 

(d) Economic and political risk

 

The Company’s major operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as well as the general state of the PRC’s economy may influence the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 

(e) Exchange rate risk

 

The Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady; therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of RMB converted to US$ on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and economic environments without notice.

 

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has no material commitments or contingencies.

 

NOTE 18 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events”, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after March 31, 2024 up through the date the Company issued the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. During the period, the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events.

 

                                                                   21



                                                         

 

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

 

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This periodic report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of management. Statements in this periodic report that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this Quarterly Report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company’s stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company’s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management’s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:

 

Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.

 

This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements are illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

We have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 global pandemic. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. China and many other countries have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease.

 

COVID-19 and China’s response to the pandemic are significantly affecting the economy. Even the COVID-19 pandemic was ended, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the effects on the economy, the markets we serve, our business or our operations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.

 

The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 and 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1 and 2, the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following addresses the Company’s most critical accounting policies.

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. A valuation allowance has currently been recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to $0.

 

Forward-looking Statements

 

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of our Company. Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company’s stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company’s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management’s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:

 

Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.

 

                                                                   25



                                                         

 

This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.

 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our President and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected but we believe the controls and procedures do provide a reasonable assurance.

 

(b) Changes in the Company’s Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
