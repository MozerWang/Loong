AMERICAN RESOURCES CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
 
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
American Resources Corporation (ARC or the Company) operates through subsidiaries that were formed or acquired in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2016 and 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, rehabilitating and operating various natural resource assets including coal used in the steel making and industrial markets, critical and rare earth elements used in the electrification economy and aggregated metal and steel products used in the recycling industries. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation:
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries American Carbon Corp (ACC), Deane Mining, LLC (Deane), ERC Mining Indiana Corp (ERC), McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC (McCoy), Knott County Coal LLC(KCC), Wyoming County Coal (WCC), Perry County Resources LLC (PCR), reElement Technologies LLC (RLMT), American Metals LLC (AM) , American Opportunity Venture II, LLC (AOV II) and T.R. Mining & Equipment Ltd. (TR Mining). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
 
Entities for which ownership is less than 100% require that a determination is made as to whether there is a requirement to apply the variable interest entity (VIE) model to the entity. Where the company holds current or potential rights that give it the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives the Company the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses, the Company would be deemed be primary.
 
The company is the primary beneficiary of Advanced Carbon Materials LLC (ACM), which qualifies as a variable interest entity. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of ACM have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The company is a 49.9% owner in ACM and has control of 90% of the cash flow which led to the determination of the Company as the primary beneficiary. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ACM had no assets, liabilities or operations.
 
On February 5, 2024, American Resources Corporation (“American Resources” or the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, American Carbon Corporation (“ACC”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with T.R. Mining & Equipment Ltd. (“TR Mining”), to where ACC has purchased 51% of the fully diluted shares outstanding of TR Mining in exchange for approximately 6% of the primary shares outstanding of ACC. The assets of TR Mining include a diversified mineral deposit with a focus on iron ore, titanium and vanadium with an initial estimated deposit of 212,925,000 tons of raw feedstock with an estimated 106,462,500 tons of ore body, based on an average of 50% magnetic material. 
 
Effective February 5, 20224, the Company acquired a 51% interest in TR Properties & Equipment Ltd. (TR) for consideration consisting of a 6% interest in the Company’s subsidiary, American Carbon Corporation (ACC).  The Company’s investment in TR substantially consists of a single asset, mining rights.  Accordingly, the transaction does not meet the definition of a business under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and therefore the Company will account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill or a bargain purchase gain are not recognized, but rather, any difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable assets acquired.  As of March 31, 2024, a preliminary allocation for this transaction has not been recorded as valuation procedures are pending with respect to the fair value of the assets acquired and consideration exchanged.
 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). 
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, unaudited consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information with the instructions to Form 10-Q. The accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Form 10-K referenced below and does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other period. These financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 15, 2024.
  
 
                                                                   7

Going Concern 
 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses of $6,225,932 and $3,100,869 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of $184,920,261 as of March 31, 2024. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements were issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company will continue to seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing during the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives.
 
Prior period reclassifications
 
We have reclassified certain amounts in prior periods to conform with current presentation. 
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted cash: Cash and cash equivalents include bank demand deposits and money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. government securities.
 
Restricted cash consist of U.S. government securities, corporate fixed income, and U.S. government securities that are held in trusts related to the Tax Exempt Bonds and are restricted as to withdrawal as required by the agreement entered into by the Company. All investments are classified as trading securities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Trading securities are recorded initially at cost and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in current period earnings or loss. 
 
The following table sets forth the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets.
 
                                                                                                        March 31,       December 31,

Cash and cash equivalents                                                                            $     2,168,557  $    2,666,638 
Restricted Cash                                                                                          177,643,892      34,664,936 
Total cash and restricted cash presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows                 $   179,812,449  $   37,331,574 
 
Related Party Policies: In accordance with FASB ASC 850 related parties are defined as either an executive, director or nominee, greater than 10% beneficial owner, and or immediate family member and affiliated businesses of any of the proceeding. Transactions with related parties are reviewed and approved by the directors of the Company, as per internal policies. 
 
Advance Royalties: Coal leases that require minimum annual or advance payments and are recoverable from future production are generally deferred and charged to expense as the coal is subsequently produced. 
 
Property and Equipment: Property and Equipment are recorded at cost. For equipment, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from five to twenty years. 
 
Property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the assets.

There was no impairment loss recognized during the period ending March 31, 2024, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the asset’s useful life are expensed as incurred. 
 
Mine Development: Costs of developing new coal mines, including asset retirement obligation assets, are capitalized and amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated coal deposits or proven reserves. Costs incurred for the development and expansion of existing reserves are expensed as incurred.
 
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit: Cost of Goods Sold for coal mined and processed include direct labor, materials and utilities. Activities related to metal recover are inherent in both direct coal labor and overhead labor and do not require additional variable costs.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) – Reclamation: At the time they are incurred, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are reflected at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to mine development. Obligations are typically incurred when we commence development of underground and surface mines, and include reclamation of support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds or through acquisitions. 
 
Obligations are reflected at the present value of their future cash flows. We reflect accretion of the obligations for the period from the date they incurred through the date they are extinguished. The asset retirement obligation assets are amortized based on expected reclamation outflows over estimated recoverable coal deposit lives. We are using discount rates ranging from 6.16% to 7.22%, risk free rates ranging from 1.76% to 2.92% and inflation rate of 2%. Revisions to estimates are a result of changes in the expected spending estimate or the timing of the spending estimate associated with planned reclamation. Federal and State laws require that mines be reclaimed in accordance with specific standards and approved reclamation plans, as outlined in mining permits. Activities include reclamation of pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at underground mines, and reclamation of refuse areas and slurry ponds.
 
We assess our ARO at least annually and reflect revisions for permit changes, changes in our estimated reclamation costs and changes in the estimated timing of such costs. 
 
The table below reflects the changes to our ARO for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023:
 
                                                                                     March 31,      December 31,  
                                                                                        2024            2023
Beginning Balance                                                                  $   20,295,634  $   20,295,634 
Accretion                                                                               1,241,455         993,165 
Ending Balance                                                                     $   21,537,089  $   21,288,799 
 
Accretion expense amounted to $248,291 and $248,291 for the period ended Mach 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.
 
Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied; for all contracts this occurs when control of the promised goods have been transferred to our customers. For coal shipments to domestic and international customers via rail, control is transferred when the railcar is loaded. Our revenue is comprised of sales of mined coal, sales of recovered metals and services for processing coal.
 
All the activity is undertaken in eastern Kentucky, Western West Virginia, and Southern Indiana. Revenue from metal recovery and sales are recognized when conditions within the contract or sales agreement are met including transfer of title. Revenue from coal processing and loading are recognized when services have been performed according to the contract in place. Our coal sales generally include 10 to 30-day payment terms following the transfer of control of the goods to the customer. We typically do not include extended payment terms in our contracts with customers. Our contracts with customers typically provide for minimum specifications or qualities of the coal we deliver. Variances from these specifications or quantities are settled by means of price adjustments. Generally, these price adjustments are settled within 30 days of delivery and are insignificant.

Income Taxes: We file a consolidated federal income tax return with our subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes is computed by applying statutory rates to income before taxes.
 
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as of each period-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A 100% valuation allowance has been established on deferred tax assets at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income.
 
We account for uncertainty in income taxes in our financial statements as required under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” The standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition accounting. Management determined there were no material uncertain positions taken by us in our tax returns.
 
Fair Value: The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
 
Note 4 presents the Company’s financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to their short-term nature.
 
Leases: The Company reviews all arrangements for potential leases, and at inception, determines whether a lease is an operating or finance lease. Lease assets and liabilities, which generally represent the present value of future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease, are recognized as of the commencement date. Leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized in the balance sheets unless the lease contains a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised.
 
Lease term, discount rate, variable lease costs and future minimum lease payment determinations require the use of judgment and are based on the facts and circumstances related to the specific lease. Lease terms are generally based on their initial non-cancelable terms, unless there is a renewal option that is reasonably certain to be exercised. Various factors, including economic incentives, intent, past history and business needs are considered to determine if a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised. The implicit rate in a lease agreement is used when it can be determined to value the lease obligation. Otherwise, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which is based on information available as of the lease commencement date, including applicable lease terms and the current economic environment, is used to determine the value of the lease obligation.
 
Allowance For Doubtful Accounts: The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on trade and other accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment of specific identifiable amounts considered at risk or uncollectible.
 
Allowance for trade receivables as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to $253,764 for both periods. The allowance for note receivables was $368,500 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The note receivable allowance relates to the purchase of a note receivable from a third party. The note receivable has collateral in certain mining permits which are strategic to KCC. Timing of payment on the note is uncertain resulting in a full allowance for the note.

Inventory: Inventory consists of mined coal is stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value.
 
Stock-based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally 0 to 5 years) using the straight-line method. 
 
Stock-based compensation to employees is accounted for under ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards granted to an employee is recognized based on the grant-date estimated fair values of the awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model (“Black Scholes”). The value is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of the award. We adjust the expense for actual forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations based on the function to which the related services are provided.
 
Black-Scholes requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are expected volatility, expected option term (the time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire) and risk-free rate. Expected volatility is determined using the historical volatility for the Company. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of US treasury government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. Expected dividend yield is zero because we have never paid cash dividends on common shares, and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
 
Earnings Per Share: The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and include the effect of any participating securities as appropriate. Diluted EPS includes the effect of the Company’s outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based stock awards if the inclusion of these items is dilutive.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements: Management has determined that the impact of the following recent FASB pronouncements will not have a material impact on the financial statements.
 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which, among other updates, requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.
 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires enhanced annual disclosures with respect to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.

NOTE 3 – INVESTMENTS IN TRADING SECURITIES
 
Investments in trading securities consist of U.S. government and agency securities and fixed income funds that are held in trusts related to the Company’s tax exempt bonds.  These investments are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying balance sheets. These securities are classified as trading securities and, accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in current period earnings or loss.
 
The Company’s investments in available-for-sale marketable securities are as follows:

Overview
 
When we formed our company, our focus was to (i) construct and/or purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline, diesel and natural gas (NG) fueling and service stations (initially, in the Miami, FL area); (ii) construct conversion factories to convert NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG); and (iii) construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on NG in the United States and also to build a convenience store to serve our customers in each of our locations.
 
On January 5, 2017, American Resources Corporation (ARC) executed a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Quest Energy Inc. (“Quest Energy”), a private company incorporated in the State of Indiana on May 2015 with offices at 12115 Visionary Way, Fishers, IN 46038, and due to the fulfillment of various conditions precedent to closing of the transaction, the control of the Company was transferred to the Quest Energy shareholders on February 7, 2017. This transaction resulted in Quest Energy becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC. Through Quest Energy, ARC was able to acquire coal mining and coal processing operations, substantially all located in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. On November 25, 2020, Quest Energy changed its name to American Carbon Corp. (American Carbon)
 
American Carbon currently has seven coal mining and processing operating subsidiaries: McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC (doing business as McCoy Elkhorn Coal Company) (McCoy Elkhorn), Knott County Coal LLC (Knott County Coal), Deane Mining, LLC (Deane Mining) and Wyoming County Coal LLC (Wyoming County), Quest Processing LLC (Quest Processing), Perry County Resources (Perry County) located in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia within the Central Appalachian coal basin, and ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (ERC) located in southwest Indiana within the Illinois coal basin. The coal deposits under control by the Company are generally comprise of metallurgical coal (used for steel making), pulverized coal injections (used in the steel making process) and high-BTU, low sulfur, low moisture bituminous coal used for a variety of uses within several industries, including industrial customers and specialty products. Since mid-2019, we have not mined or sold coal which is sold into the thermal coal markets. All production and future investment will be for the mining of metallurgical coal used in the steel and specialty markets. 
 
Efforts to diversify revenue streams have led to the establishment of additional subsidiaries; American Metals LLC (AM) which is focused on the recovery and sale of recovered metal and steel and ReElement Technologies LLC (ReElement) which is focused on the aggregation and monetization of critical and rare earth element deposits.
 
We have not classified, and as a result, do not have any “proven” or “probable” reserves as defined in United States Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7, and as a result, our company and its business activities are deemed to be in the exploration stage until mineral deposits are defined on our properties.

The coal controlled at McCoy Elkhorn (along with our other subsidiaries) has not been classified as either “proven” or “probable” as defined in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Items 1300 through 1305 of Regulation S-K, and as a result, do not have any “proven” or “probable” reserves under such definition and are classified as an “Exploration Stage” pursuant to Items 1300 through 1305 of Regulation S-K. 
 
Mines: 
 
Mine #15 is an underground mine in the Millard (also known as Glamorgan) coal seam and located near Meta, Kentucky. Mine #15 is mined via room-and-pillar mining methods using continuous miners, and the coal is belted directly from the stockpile to McCoy Elkhorn’s coal preparation facility. Mine #15 is currently a “company run” mine, whereby the Company manages the workforce at the mine. The coal from Mine #15 is stockpiled at the mine site and belted directly to the Company’s nearby coal preparation facilities. Production at Mine #15 re-commenced under Quest Energy’s ownership in September 2016.
 
The Carnegie 1 Mine is an underground mine in the Alma and Upper Alma coal seams and located near Kimper, Kentucky. In 2011, coal production from the Carnegie Mine in the Alma coal seam commenced and then subsequently the mine was idled. Production at the Carnegie Mine was reinitiated in early 2017 under Quest Energy’s ownership and is currently being mined via room-and-pillar mining methods utilizing a continuous miner. The coal is stockpiled on-site and trucked approximately 7 miles to McCoy Elkhorn’s preparation facilities. The Carnegie Mine is currently operated as a modified contractor mine, whereby McCoy Elkhorn provides the mining infrastructure and equipment for the operations and pays the contractor a fixed per-ton fee for managing the workforce, procuring the supplies, and maintaining the equipment and infrastructure in proper working order. 
 
The Carnegie 2 Mine is an underground mine in the Alma and Upper Alma coal seams and located near Kimper, Kentucky. In 2021, mine development began and operations at the Carnegie 2 Mine started in August 2022 and is currently being mined via room-and-pillar mining methods utilizing a continuous miner. The coal is stockpiled on-site and trucked approximately 7 miles to McCoy Elkhorn’s preparation facilities. The Carnegie 2 Mine is currently a “company run” mine, whereby the Company manages the workforce at the mine and pays all expenses of the mine. The Carnegie 2. Mine has the estimated capacity to produce up to approximately 10,000 tons per month of coal. 
 
The mineral being mined through Carnegie 1 and Carnegie 2 is leased from a 3rd party professional mineral company.  Coal mined from the lease requires a payment of greater of $1.75 per ton or 6% of gross sales price. 
 
Beginning in January 2020, Mine #15 and Carnegie 1 mines were idled due to the adverse market effects Covid-19 global pandemic. The Carnegie 1 mine restarted during October 2022 and the Carnegie 2 mine commenced during 2022.

Perry County Resources LLC
 
General:
 
Located primarily within Perry County, Kentucky, Perry County Resources LLC is comprised of one “Idled” underground mine (the E4-2 mine) and one “Idled” coal processing facility called the Davidson Branch Preparation Plant, along with two additional idled underground mining permits. The two idled mining permits are for underground mines and have been actively mined in the past and being maintained as idled, pending any changes to the coal market that may warrant re-starting production. The coal controlled at Perry County Resources (along with our other subsidiaries) has not been classified as either “proven” or “probable” as defined in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Items 1300 through 1305 of Regulation S-K, and as a result, do not have any “proven” or “probable” reserves under such definition and are classified as an “Exploration Stage” pursuant to Items 1300 through 1305 of Regulation S-K.
 
Mines:
 
The E4-2 mine is an underground mine in the Elkhorn 4 (aka the Amburgy) coal seam located near the town of Hazard, Kentucky. The E4-2 mine is mined via room-and-pillar mining methods using both continuous miners and continuous haulage systems, and the coal is belted directly from the mine to the raw coal stockpile at the Davidson Branch Preparation Plant less than a mile away. The E4-2 mine is currently a “company-run” mine, whereby the Company manages the workforce at the mine and pays all expenses of the mine. The Company acquired the E4-2 mine as an active mine, and since acquisition in September 2019, the primary work at the E4-2 mine has been rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to increase the operational efficiencies of the mine, including replacing belt structure, repairing equipment, replacing underground mining infrastructure, and installing new mining infrastructure as the mine advances due to coal extraction. The E4-2 mine has the estimated capacity to produce up to approximately 80,000 tons per month of coal. 
 
Beginning in January 2020, The E4-2 mine was idled due to the adverse market effects Covid-19 global pandemic. The E4-2 Mine was restarted during March 2022 and idled due to regional flooding during October 2022.  
Processing and Transportation:
 
The Davidson Branch Preparation Plant is a 1,300 ton-per-hour coal preparation facility located near Hazard, Kentucky. The associated “Bluegrass 4” rail loadout is a batch-weight rail loadout with 135 car storage capacity and services by CSX Transportation in their Hazard/Elkhorn rate district. The Davidson Branch Preparation Plant is owned by Perry County Resources. We are currently utilizing less than 10% of the available processing capacity of the Davidson Branch Preparation Plant.
 
Both the Davidson Branch Preparation Plant and the rail loadout are operational, and any work required on any of the plant or loadouts would be routine maintenance. The allocated cost of for the property at Perry County Resources paid by the Company is $1,954,317.
 
Additional Permits:
 
In addition to the above mine, preparation facility, and related permits, Perry County Resources holds four additional coal mining permits that are idled or in development. Any idled mines that are brought into production would require significant upfront capital investment and there is no assurance of the feasibility of any such new operations. 
 
The transfer of any new permits to the Company is subject to regulatory approval. This approval is subject to the review of both unabated or uncorrected violations that are listed on the Applicator Violator List. The Company, to include several of its subsidiaries, does have unabated and/or uncorrected violations that are listed on the Applicator Violator List. Should the state regulators believe that the Company is not in the process of abating or correcting the currently outstanding issues associated with their currently held permits they may choose not to issue the Company any new permits until such issues are properly rectified.

Mineral and Surface Leases
 
Coal mining and processing involves the extraction of coal (mineral) and the use of surface property incidental to such extraction and processing. All of the mineral and surface related to the Company’s coal mining operations is leased from various mineral and surface owners (the “Leases”). The Company’s operating subsidiaries, collectively, are parties to approximately 200 various Leases and other agreements required for the Company’s coal mining and processing operations. The Leases are with a variety of Lessors, from individuals to professional land management firms such as the Roadrunner Land Company. In some instances, the Company has leases with Land Resources & Royalties LLC (LRR), a professional leasing firm that is an entity wholly owned by Wabash Enterprises Inc, an entity owned by members of Quest Energy Inc.’s management. 
 
Coal Sales
 
ARC sells its coal to domestic and international customers, some which blend ARC’s coal at east coast ports with other qualities of coal for export. Coal sales currently come from the Company’s Carnegie 1 and 2 mines. The Company may, at times, purchase coal from other regional producers to sell on its contracts.
 
Competition
 
The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which the Company competes are coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and reliability of supply. Our principal domestic competitors will include Corsa Coal Corporation, Ramaco Resources, Blackhawk Mining, Coronado Coal, Arch Resources, Contura Energy, and Warrior Met Coal. Many of these coal producers may have greater financial resources and larger coal deposit bases than we do. We also compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries, such as China, Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa.  
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. 
 
Please see the financial statement’s contingencies footnote.
 
Environmental, Governmental, and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to matters such as permitting and licensing, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, remediation of contaminants, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions. In addition, we may become subject to additional costs for benefits for current and retired coal miners. These environmental laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) with respect to coal mining activities and ancillary activities; the Clean Air Act (CAA) with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act (CWA) with respect to water discharges and the permitting of key operational infrastructure such as impoundments; Resource Conservation and Recovery RCRA with respect to solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, as well as the regulation of underground storage tanks; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) with respect to releases, threatened releases and remediation of hazardous substances; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) with respect to threatened and endangered species; and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to the evaluation of environmental impacts related to any federally issued permit or license. Many of these federal laws have state and local counterparts which also impose requirements and potential liability on our operations.
 
 
                                                                   28

Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities. They may also depress demand for our products by imposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly complex and stringent over time. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs. Individually and collectively, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operations directly and/or indirectly, through our customers’ inability to use our products.
 
Certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws are undergoing revision or have not yet been promulgated. As a result, we cannot always determine the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations.
 
Due in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of these requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and compliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be reduced. 
 
In addition, our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which may affect demand for our coal. Changes in applicable laws or the adoption of new laws relating to energy production, greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions from use of coal products may cause coal to become a less attractive source of energy, which may adversely affect our mining operations, the cost structure and, the demand for coal.
 
We believe that our competitors with operations in the United States are confronted by substantially similar conditions. However, foreign producers and operators may not be subject to similar requirements and may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in or be subject to similar limitations on their operations. As a result, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with United States environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to those foreign competitors. The specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable legislation and its production methods.
 
The Mine Act and the MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.
 
Due to the large number of mining permits held by the Company that have been previously mined and operated, there is a significant amount of environmental reclamation and remediation required by the Company to comply with local, state, and federal regulations for coal mining companies.

Employees
 
ARC, through its operating subsidiaries, employs a combination of company employees and contract labor to mine coal, process coal, and related functions. The Company is continually evaluating the use of company employees and contract labor to determine the optimal mix of each, given the needs of the Company. Currently, McCoy Elkhorn’s Carnegie 1 and 2 Mines and Perry’s E4-1 mine and are primarily run by contract labor, and the Company’s various coal preparation facilities are run by contract labor.
 
The Company currently has approximately 26 direct employees. The Company is headquartered in Fishers, Indiana with four members of the Company’s executive team based at this location. 
 
Results of Operations
 
Our consolidated operations had operating revenues of $94,019 and $8,868,456 for the three-months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of $6,225,932 and $3,100,869 for the same periods, respectively.
 
The primary driver for the decrease in operating revenues is a significant reduction in our coal sales for the period ended March 31, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
From our inception to-date our activities have been primarily financed from the proceeds of our acquisitions, common share equity investments and loans. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, cost of coal sales and processing expenses were $1,266,928 and $2,705,820 respectively, development costs, including loss on settlement of ARO were $2,397,140 and $5,633,908, respectively, and production taxes and royalties were $121,767 and $981,636, respectively. Depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $22,086 and $13,336 respectively and general and administrative expenses were $2,062,021 and $1,321,468, respectively. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
As of March 31, 2024, our available cash was $2,166,857. We expect to fund our liquidity requirements with cash on hand, future borrowings and cash flow from operations. If future cash flows are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, we may reduce our mine development and/or fund a portion of our expenditures through issuance of debt or equity securities, or from other sources, such as asset sales. We do not have any credit lines currently available to fund our liquidity requirements, and currently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to execute on the above strategy. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our net cash flow used in operating activities was $8,131,227 and $7,342,964, respectively. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $3,797,176compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, during which $967,343 was provided by investing activities. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $146,814,926 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, during which $2,194,747 was used in financing activities. 
 
 
                                                                   30

As a public company, we will be subject to certain reporting and other compliance requirements of a publicly reporting company. We will be subject to certain costs for such compliance which private companies may not choose to make. We have identified such costs as being primarily for audits, legal services, filing expenses, financial and reporting controls and shareholder communications and estimate the cost to be approximately $35,000 monthly if the activities of our Company remain somewhat the same for the next few months. We have included such costs in our monthly cash flow needs and expect to pay such costs from a combination of cash from operations and financing activities. 
 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in Note 1 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"), which, among other updates, requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.
 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-09"), which requires enhanced annual disclosures with respect to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.
 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
Because we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include any disclosure under this item. 
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
(a) Management’s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
With respect to the period ending March 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending March 31, 2024, the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company’s insufficient number of staff performing accounting and reporting functions and lack of timely reconciliations. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.
 
 
                                                                   31

Table of Contents
 
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
 
(b) Changes in Internal Controls.
 
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
 
 
                                                                   32
