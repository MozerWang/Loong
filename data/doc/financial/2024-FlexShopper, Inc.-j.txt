CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

Certain information set forth in this report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by that section. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate” “strategy,” “future,” “likely” or other comparable terms and references to future periods. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the expansion of our lease-to-own program, expectations concerning our partnerships with retail partners, investments in, and the success of, our underwriting technology and risk analytics platform, our ability to collect payments due from customers, expected future operating results, and expectations concerning our business strategy.

 

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:

 

     ●    general economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, and other adverse macro-economic conditions;

           

     ●    the impact of deteriorating macro-economic environment on our customer’s ability to make the payment they owe our business

           and on our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving customer to be indicative of customer’s ability

           to

           perform;

           

     ●    our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our business operations in the future;

           

     ●    our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our credit agreement;

           

     ●    the failure to successfully manage and grow our FlexShopper.com e-commerce platform;

           

     ●    our ability to compete in a highly competitive industry; 

           

     ●    our ability to attract and onboard a new bank partner that originates the loans in the bank partner loan model;

           

     ●    our dependence on the success of our third-party retailers and our continued relationships with them;

           

     ●    our relationship with the bank partner that originate the loans in the bank partner loan model;

           

     ●    our compliance with various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection;

           

     ●    the failure to protect the integrity and security of customer and employee information;

           

     ●    our ability to attract and retain key executives and employees;

           

     ●    our ability to realize the deferred tax asset; and

           

     ●    the other risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

           Condition and Results of Operations” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

           2023.

  

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required under federal securities law. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. You should read this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may undertake. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.

 

Estimates - The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Segment Information - Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available between which resources are allocated by the chief operating decision maker. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company has one operating and reportable segment that includes all the Company’s business, which is consistent with the current organization structure.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions, which at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While the Company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which the Company deposits fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, the Company has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, no assurance can be provided that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.

 

Lease Revenue Recognition - Merchandise is leased to customers pursuant to lease purchase agreements which provide for weekly lease terms with non-refundable lease payments. Generally, the customer has the right to acquire title either through a 90-day same as cash option, an early purchase option, or through completion of all required lease payments, generally 52 weeks. On any current lease, customers have the option to cancel the agreement in accordance with lease terms and return the merchandise. Customer agreements are accounted for as operating leases with lease revenues recognized in the month they are due on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenue for lease payments received prior to their due date is deferred and is recognized as revenue in the period to which the payments relate. Revenues from leases and sales are reported net of sales taxes.

 

Retail Revenue Recognition – The Company sells products directly to other lenders that offer alternative solutions on FlexShopper’s website and make a profit on the product margin. The Company accounts for the Retail Revenue under ASC 606. The Company has a single performance obligation that is the delivery of the product, at which point control transfers. Revenue for the sale of products is recognized at the time of delivery.

Lease Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - FlexShopper seeks to collect amounts owed under its leases from each customer on a weekly or biweekly basis by charging their bank accounts or credit cards. Lease receivables are principally comprised of lease payments currently owed to FlexShopper which are past due, as FlexShopper has been unable to successfully collect in the aforementioned manner and therefore the Company has an in-house and near-shore team to collect on the past due amounts. FlexShopper maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, under which FlexShopper’s policy is to record an allowance for estimated uncollectible charges, primarily based on historical collection experience that considers both the aging of the lease and the origination channel. Other qualitative factors are considered in estimating the allowance, such as seasonality, underwriting changes, and other business trends. We believe our allowance is adequate to absorb all expected losses. The lease receivables balances consisted of the following as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 

                                                                                                        March 31,      December 31,  

                                                                                                           2024            2023

                                                                                                                                     

Lease receivables                                                                                     $   76,748,221  $   64,749,918 

Allowance for doubtful accounts                                                                          (27,432,189)    (19,954,828)

Lease receivables, net                                                                                $   49,316,032  $   44,795,090 

 

The allowance is a significant percentage of the balance because FlexShopper does not charge off any customer account until it has exhausted all collection efforts with respect to each account, including attempts to repossess items. Lease receivables balances charged off against the allowance were $2,006,688 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $18,971,772 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Lease Merchandise, net - Until all payment obligations for ownership are satisfied under the lease agreement, the Company maintains ownership of the lease merchandise. Lease merchandise consists primarily of residential furniture, consumer electronics, computers, appliances, and household accessories and is recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The Company depreciates leased merchandise using the straight-line method over the applicable agreement period for a consumer to acquire ownership, generally twelve months with no salvage value. Upon transfer of ownership of merchandise to customers resulting from satisfaction of their lease obligations, the Company reflects the undepreciated portion of the lease merchandise as depreciation expense and the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from lease merchandise. For lease merchandise returned either voluntarily or through repossession, the Company provides an impairment reserve for the undepreciated balance of the merchandise net of any estimated salvage value with a corresponding charge to depreciation and impairment of lease merchandise. The cost, accumulated depreciation and impairment reserve related to such merchandise are written off upon determination that no salvage value is obtainable.

 

The net lease merchandise balances consisted of the following as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Loan receivables at fair value – The Company elected the fair value option on its entire loan and loan participation receivables portfolio. As such, loan receivables are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accrued and unpaid interest and fees are included in loan receivables at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the reporting of these receivables at fair value method closely approximates the true economics of the loan.

 

Interest and fees are discontinued when loan receivables become contractually 90 or more days past due. The Company charges-off loans at the earlier of when the loans are determined to be uncollectible or when the loans are 90 days contractually past due. Recoveries on loan receivables that were previously charged off are recognized when cash is received. Changes in the fair value of loan receivables include the impact of current period charge offs associated with these receivables. 

 

The Company estimates the fair value of the loan receivables using a discounted cash flow analysis at an individual loan level to more accurately predict future payments. The Company adjusts expected cash flows for estimated losses and servicing costs over the estimated duration of the underlying assets. These adjustments are determined using historical data and include appropriate consideration of recent trends and anticipated future performance. Future cash flows are discounted using a rate of return that the Company believes a market participant would require. Model results may be adjusted by management if the Company does not believe the output reflects the fair value of the instrument, as defined under U.S. GAAP. The models are updated at each measurement date to capture any changes in internal factors such as nature, term, volume, payment trends, remaining time to maturity, and portfolio mix, as well as changes in underwriting or observed trends expected to impact future performance.

 

Further details concerning loan receivables at fair value are presented within “Fair Value Measurement” section in this Note.

 

Net changes in the fair value of loan receivables included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the line “loan revenues and fees, net of changes in fair value” was a loss of $4,211,396 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and a loss of $984,652 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Lease Accounting - The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842 Leases (Topic 842). Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize leases at the commencement date as a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term. For more information on leases for which the Company is lessee, refer to Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Under the same Topic, lessors are also required to classify leases. All customer agreements are considered operating leases, and the Company currently does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases as a lessor. An operating lease with a customer results in the recognition of lease income on a straight-line basis, while the underlying leased asset remains on the lessor’s balance sheet and continues to depreciate. The breakout of lease revenues and fees, net of lessor bad debt expense, that ties to the condensed consolidated statements of operations is shown below:

Intangible Assets – Intangible assets consist of a patent on the Company’s LTO payment method at check-out for third party e-commerce sites and of assets acquired in connection with Revolution Transaction (See Note 14). The patent is stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Patent costs are amortized by using the straight-line method over the legal life, or if shorter, the useful life of the patent, which has been estimated to be ten years.

 

In the Revolution Transaction, the Company identified intangible assets for the franchisee contract-based agreements, the related non-compete agreements, the Liberty Loan brand, the non-contractual customer relationships associated with the corporate locations and the list of previous customers. The franchisee contract-based agreements relate to the assignment of agreements with Liberty Tax franchisees in which their locations and staff are used to assist in the origination and servicing of a loan portfolio in exchange for a share of the net revenue. In addition, there is non-compete embedded in these agreements. The Liberty Loan brand intangible asset relates to the value associated with the established brands acquired in the transaction that would otherwise need to be licensed. The non-contractual customer relationship intangible asset is the value of the customer relationships for the corporate stores acquired in the transaction. The customer list intangible asset relates to the value of valuable customers information that will be used to market additional products. The franchisee contract-based agreement, the Liberty Loan brand and the non-compete intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the assets of ten years. The non-contractual customer relationship intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year estimated useful life. The customer list is amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.

 

For intangible assets with finite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets amortization expense was $442,334 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $443,059 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets on a straight-line basis, ranging from 2 to 7 years. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred, unless such expenses extend the useful life of the asset, in which case they are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was $1,535,712 and $1,163,348 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively

 

Software Costs – Costs related to developing or obtaining internal-use software incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of an internal use software project are expensed as incurred and certain costs incurred in the project’s application development stage are capitalized as property and equipment. The Company expenses costs related to the planning and operating stages of a website. Costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for the website are included in expenses as incurred. Direct costs incurred in the website’s development stage are capitalized as property and equipment. Capitalized software costs amounted to $1,283,691 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1,295,814 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Capitalized software amortization expense was $1,147,478 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $909,344 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Data Costs - The Company buys data from different vendors upon receipt of an application. The data costs directly used to make underwriting decisions are expensed as incurred. Certain data costs that are probable to provide future economic benefit to the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The probability to provide future economic benefit of the data cost assets is estimated based upon future usage of the information in different areas and products of the Company.

 

Capitalized data costs amounted to $464,443 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $169,082 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Capitalized data costs amortization expense was $337,441 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $219,750 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

 

Capitalized data costs net of its amortization are included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in Other assets, net.

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets – We evaluate all long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related assets may not be recoverable by the undiscounted net cash flow they will generate. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amounts of such assets exceed their fair value. For the three months period ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no impairments.

 

Operating Expenses - Operating expenses include corporate overhead expenses such as salaries, stock-based compensation, insurance, occupancy, and other administrative expenses.

 

Marketing Costs - Marketing costs, primarily consisting of advertising, are charged to expense as incurred. Direct acquisition costs, primarily consisting of commissions earned based on lease originations, are capitalized and amortized over the life of the lease.

 

Per Share Data - Per share data is computed by use of the two-class method as a result of outstanding Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, which participates in dividends with the common stock and accordingly has participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period (see Note 9). Under such method income available to common shareholders is computed by deducting both dividends declared or, if not declared, accumulated on Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock from net income. Loss attributable to common shareholders is computed by increasing net loss by such dividends. Where the Company has a net loss, as the participating Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock has no contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company, there is no loss allocation between common stock and Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common shareholders reduced by any dividends paid or declared on common and participating Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock by the total of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

Diluted earnings per share is based on the more dilutive of the if-converted method (which assumes conversion of the participating Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock as of the beginning of the period) or the two-class method (which assumes that the participating Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock is not converted) plus the potential impact of dilutive non-participating Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock, options, performance share units and warrants. The dilutive effect of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock is computed using the if-converted method. The dilutive effect of options, performance share units and warrants are computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes the repurchase of common shares at the average market price during the period. Under the treasury stock method, options, performance share units and warrants will have a dilutive effect when the average price of common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of options, performance share units or warrants. When there is a loss from continuing operations, potential common shares are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share since they have an anti-dilutive effect.

 

The following table reflects the number of common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise.

Stock-Based Compensation - The fair value of transactions in which the Company exchanges its equity instruments for employee and non-employee services (share-based payment transactions) is recognized as a compensation expense in the financial statements as services are performed.

 

Compensation expense for stock options is determined by reference to the fair value of an award on the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model to determine the fair value of all stock option awards.

 

Compensation expense for performance share units is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s projected assessment of the level of performance that will be achieved and earned. The fair value of performance share units is based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant (see Note 10).

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying value of certain financial instruments such as cash, lease receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of loans payable under the Credit Agreement and the carrying value of promissory notes to related parties approximates fair value based upon their interest rates, which approximate current market interest rates.

The Company utilizes the fair value option on its entire loan receivables portfolio purchased from its bank partner and for the portfolio of loans directly acquired in the state licensed model.

 

Fair Value Measurements- The Company uses a hierarchical framework that prioritizes and ranks the market observability of inputs used in its fair value measurements. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of asset or liability and the characteristics specific to the asset or liability being measured. Assets and liabilities with readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally are deemed to have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. The Company classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three levels as follows:

 

     ●    Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

           

     ●    Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for

           identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are

           observable or whose significant value drivers are

           observable.

 

     ●    Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability measured.

 

Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.

 

The Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:

 

                                                                              Fair Value Measurement Using               Carrying    

Financial instruments – As of March 31, 2024 (1)                        Level 1         Level 2        Level 3          Amount

                                                                              Fair Value Measurement Using               Carrying    

Financial instruments – As of December 31, 2023 (1)                     Level 1         Level 2        Level 3          Amount

(1)  For cash, lease receivable, and accounts payable the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their

      short-term nature. The carrying value of loans payable under the Credit Agreement, the carrying value of loan payable under

      Basepoint Credit Agreement, and the carrying value of promissory notes to related parties approximates fair value based upon

      their interest rates, which approximate current market interest rates.

      

 

The Company primarily estimates the fair value of its loan receivables portfolio using discounted cash flow models. The models use inputs, such as estimated losses, servicing costs and discount rates, that are unobservable but reflect the Company’s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. Certain unobservable inputs may, in isolation, have either a directionally consistent or opposite impact on the fair value of the financial instrument for a given change in that input. An increase to the net loss rate, servicing cost, or discount rate would decrease the fair value of the Company’s loan receivables. When multiple inputs are used within the valuation techniques for loan receivables, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change from another input.

 

12

 

 

The following describes the primary inputs to the discounted cash flow models that require significant judgement:

 

     ●    Estimated losses are estimates of the principal payments that will not be repaid over the life of the loans, net of the

           expected principal recoveries on charged-off receivables. FlexShopper systems monitor collections and portfolio performance

           data that are used to continually refine the analytical models and statistical measures used in making marketing and

           underwriting decisions. Leveraging the data at the core of the business, the Company utilizes the models to estimate

           lifetime credit losses for loan receivables. Inputs to the models include expected cash flows, historical and current

           performance, and behavioral information. Management may also incorporate discretionary adjustments based on the Company’s

           expectations of future credit

           performance.

 

     ●    Servicing costs – Servicing costs applied to the expected cash flows of the portfolio reflect the Company estimate of the

           amount investors would incur to service the underlying assets for the remainder of their lives. Servicing costs are derived

           from the Company internal analysis of our cost structure considering the characteristics of the receivables and have been

           benchmarked against observable information on comparable assets in the

           marketplace.

 

     ●    Discount rates – the discount rates utilized in the cash flow analyses reflect the Company estimates of the rates of return

           that investors would require when investing in financial instruments with similar risk and return

           characteristics.

Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when management concludes that it is not more likely than not that such assets will be recognized.

 

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be charged to interest and operating expenses.

 

4. LEASES

 

Refer to Note 3 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company’s revenue generating activities as a lessor. All the Company’s customer agreements are considered operating leases, and the Company currently does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases as a lessor.

 

Lease Commitments

 

In January 2019, FlexShopper entered into a 108-month lease with an option for one additional five-year term for 21,622 square feet of office space in Boca Raton, FL to accommodate FlexShopper’s business and its employees. The monthly rent for this space is approximately $31,500 with annual three percent increases throughout the initial 108-month lease term beginning on the anniversary of the commencement date, which was September 18, 2019.

 

In September 2021, FlexShopper entered into a 12-month lease for an office space for approximately 18 people at the Battery at SunTrust Park at Georgia, Atlanta mainly to expand the sales team. This lease was renewed for another twelve month period with a monthly rent of approximately $8,800. This lease ended in September 2023. This lease was accounted for under the practical expedient for leases with initial terms for 12 months or less, and as such no related right of use asset or liability was recorded.

 

As part of the Revolution Transaction (See Note 14), 22 storefront lease agreements were acquired by FlexShopper. Some of those stores were closed or transferred to franchisees after the Revolution Transaction. As of March 31, 2024, 34 storefront lease agreements belong to FlexShopper. The stores are located in Alabama, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, and Oklahoma and are used to offer finance products to customers. The monthly average rent for these stores is approximately $1,800 per month. These leases are accounted for under the practical expedient for leases with initial terms for 12 months or less, and as such no related right of use asset or liability was recorded.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for its leases, as the implicit rate in the lease is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. The lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Under the short-term lease exception provided within ASC 842, the Company does not record a lease liability or right-of-use asset for any leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement.

8. LOAN PAYABLE UNDER CREDIT AGREEMENT

 

On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Borrower”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended from time-to-time, the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and WE 2014-1, LLC, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, as administrative agent and lender (“Lender”). On September 2022, WE 2014-1, LLC assigned 100% of its Commitments and all Loans to Powerscourt Investments 32, LP, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC. The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed was SOFR plus 11% per annum. The Commitment Termination Date was April 1, 2024.

 

On March 27, 2024, the Company refinanced all the obligations under the Credit Agreement owed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and all liens held by any of the Lenders, or the Administrative Agent were discharged and released. The Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Company terminated the Credit Agreement.

 

On March 27, 2024, FlexShopper, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Borrower”), entered into a new credit agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”) with Computershare Trust Company, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and Powerscourt Investment 50, LP, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, as administrative agent and lender (“Lender”). The Borrower is permitted to borrow funds under the 2024 Credit Agreement based on FlexShopper’s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the 2024 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to $150,000,000 from the Lender until the Commitment Termination Date and must repay all borrowed amounts one year thereafter, on the date that is 12 months following the Commitment Termination Date (unless such amounts become due or payable on an earlier date pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement). The Commitment Termination Date is April 1, 2026. The Lender was granted a security interest in certain leases and loans as collateral under this Agreement. The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed is SOFR plus 9% per annum. The Company will pay the Lender a fee in an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate Commitments as of March 27, 2024, payable in 12 monthly installments on each interest payment date commencing April 2024. At March 31, 2024, amounts borrowed bear interest at 14.44%.

 

The 2024 Credit Agreement provides that FlexShopper may not incur additional indebtedness (other than expressly permitted indebtedness) without the permission of the Lender, and also prohibits payments of cash dividends on common stock. Additionally, the 2024 Credit Agreement includes covenants requiring FlexShopper to maintain a minimum amount of Equity Book Value, Liquidity and Cash, and maintain a certain ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Equity Book Value (each capitalized term, as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). Upon a Permitted Change of Control, FlexShopper must refinance the debt under the 2024 Credit Agreement, subject to the payment of an early termination fee. A summary of the covenant requirements, and FlexShopper’s actual results at March 31, 2024, follows:

 

                                                                                                               March 31, 2024

                                                                                                          Covenant        Position

Equity Book Value not less than                                                                        $   16,452,246  $   29,227,621 

Liquidity greater than                                                                                      1,500,000       5,593,750 

Cash greater than                                                                                             500,000       5,593,750 

Consolidated Total Debt to Equity Book Value ratio not to exceed                                                 5.25            4.29 

 

The 2024 Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of FlexShopper in the 2024 Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants), deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against FlexShopper and bankruptcy events.

 

The Company borrowed under the Credit Agreement and under the 2024 Credit Agreement $10,611,690 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $2,750,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company repaid under the Credit Agreement and under 2024 Credit Agreement $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $2,575,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Interest expense incurred under the Credit Agreement and under the 2024 Credit Agreement amounted to $4,285,346 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $3,278,837 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The outstanding balance under the 2024 Credit Agreement was $107,066,690 as of March 31, 2024 and was $96,455,000 under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. Such amount is presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,500,000 and $70,780 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest is payable monthly on the outstanding balance of the amounts borrowed. No principal is expected to be repaid in the next twelve months due to the Commitment Termination Date having been extended to April 1, 2026, or from reductions in the borrowing base. Accordingly, all principal is shown as a non-current liability at March 31, 2024.

9. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

 

The Company’s capital structure consists of preferred and common stock as described below:

 

Preferred Stock

 

The Company is authorized to issue 500,000 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock. Of this amount, 250,000 shares have been designated as Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock and 25,000 shares have been designated as Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company’s Board of Directors determines the rights and preferences of the Company’s preferred stock.

 

●    Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock – Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to common stock upon liquidation.

 

As of March 31, 2024, each share of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 1.32230 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution rights. The holders of the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock have the option to convert the shares to common stock at any time. Upon conversion, all accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, will be paid as additional shares of common stock. The holders of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock have the same dividend rights as holders of common stock, as if the Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted to common stock.

 

As of March 31, 2024, there were 170,332 shares of Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding, which were convertible into 225,231 shares of common stock.

 

●    Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock – The Company sold to B2 FIE V LLC (the “Investor”), an entity affiliated with Pacific

      Investment Management Company LLC, 20,000 shares of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series 2 Preferred Stock”) for gross

      proceeds of $20.0 million. The Company sold an additional 1,952 shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock to a different investor for

      gross proceeds of $1.95 million at a subsequent

      closing.

 

The Series 2 Preferred Shares were sold for $1,000 per share (the “Stated Value”) and accrue dividends on the Stated Value at an annual rate of 10% compounded annually. Cumulative accrued dividends as of March 31, 2024 totaled $24,257,470. As of March 31, 2024, each Series 2 Preferred Share was convertible into approximately 266 shares of common stock; however, the conversion rate is subject to further increase pursuant to a weighted average anti-dilution provision. The holders of the Series 2 Preferred Stock have the option to convert such shares into shares of common stock and have the right to vote with holders of common stock on an as-converted basis. If the average closing price during any 45-day consecutive trading day period or change of control transaction values the common stock at a price equal to or greater than $23.00 per share, then conversion shall be automatic. Upon a Liquidation Event or Deemed Liquidation Event (each as defined), holders of Series 2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company prior to and in preference to the common stock and Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock an amount equal to the greater of (1) the Stated Value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and (2) the amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock been converted to common stock immediately before the Liquidation Event or Deemed Liquidation Event.

 

As the dividends for the Series 2 Preferred Shares have not been declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, there is no dividends accrual reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statement. The Series 2 Preferred Shares dividends is reflected on the condensed consolidated statement of operations for purposes of determining the net income attributable to common and Series 1 Convertible Preferred shareholders.

 

Common Stock

 

The Company is authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote at all stockholder meetings. The common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FPAY.”

In April 2018, the Company adopted the FlexShopper, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan replaced the Prior Plans. No new awards will be granted under the Prior Plans; however, awards outstanding under the Prior Plans upon approval of the 2018 Plan remain subject to and will be settled with shares under the applicable Prior Plan.

 

Grants under the 2018 Plan and the Prior Plans consist of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents and other stock-based awards. Employees, directors and consultants and other service providers are eligible to participate in the 2018 Plan and the Prior Plans. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 2,150,461 shares remained available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.

 

Stock-based compensation expense include the following components:

Total stock-based compensation                                                                          $     217,125  $     420,748 

 

The fair value of stock-based compensation is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Compensation expense recorded for stock-based compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $217,125 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $420,748 for three months ended March 31, 2023. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options and PSU at March 31, 2024 amounted to $964,416, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.01 years.

 

Stock options:

 

The fair value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period. The Company measured the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model. The Company didn’t grant stock options during the three months periods ending March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

Performance Share Units:

 

On February 10, 2022, and on April 21, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved awards of performance share units to certain senior executives of the Company.

 

For performance share units, which are settled in stock, the number of shares earned is subject to both performance and time-based vesting. For the performance component, the number of shares earned is determined at the end of the periods based upon achievement of specified performance conditions such as the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA. When the performance criteria are met, the award is earned and vests assuming continued employment through the specified service period(s). Shares are issued from the Company’s 2018 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan upon vesting. The number of 2023 PSU which could potentially be issued ranges from 0 up to a maximum of 1,250,000 of the target awards depending on the specified terms and conditions of the target award.

 

The fair value of performance share units is based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The compensation expense associated with these awards is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s projected assessment of the level of performance that will be achieved and earned. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the plan will be achieved, all previously recognized compensation expense is reversed in the period such a determination is made. The 2022 PSU were forfeited in April 2023 as the minimum performance component was not achieved. For the 2023 PSU, the Company determined it was probable that the minimum performance component would be met and accordingly commenced amortization in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. 

 

Activity in performance share units for the three months period ended March 31, 2024 was as follows:

 

                                                                                                       Number of         Weighted

11. INCOME TAXES

 

Effective income tax rates for interim periods are based on the Company’s estimate of the applicable annual income tax rate. The Company’s effective income tax rate varies based upon the estimate of the Company’s annual taxable earnings and the allocation of those taxable earnings across the various states in which we operate. Changes in the annual allocation of the Company’s activity among these jurisdictions results in changes to the effective tax rate utilized to measure the Company’s income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 

The Company’s effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was approximately 21%.

 

The realization of the deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2024 is more likely than not based on the Company’s projected taxable income.

 

12. CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

 

Regulatory inquiries

 

In the first quarter of 2021, FlexShopper, along with a number of other lease-to-own companies, received a subpoena from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “DFPI”) requesting the production of documents and information regarding the Company’s compliance with state consumer protection laws. The Company is cooperatively engaging with the DFPI in response to its inquiry. Although the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable consumer protection laws and regulations in California, this inquiry ultimately could lead to an enforcement action and/or a consent order, and substantial costs, including legal fees, fines, penalties, and remediation expenses.

 

Litigation

 

The Company is not involved in any current or pending material litigation. The Company could be involved in litigation incidental to the operation of the business. The Company intends to vigorously defend all matters in which the Company is named defendants, and, for insurable losses, maintain significant levels of insurance to protect against adverse judgments, claims or assessments that may affect the Company. Although the adequacy of existing insurance coverage of the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, based on the current information available, the Company does not believe the ultimate liability associated with known claims or litigation, if any, in which the Company is involved will materially affect the Company’s condensed consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

 

Employment agreements

 

Certain executive management entered into employment agreements with the Company. The contracts are for a period of three years and renew for three successive one-year terms unless receipt of written notices by the parties. The contracts provide that such management may earn discretionary cash bonuses and equity awards, based on financial performance metrics defined each year by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Additionally, under certain termination conditions, such contracts provide for severance payments and other benefits.

  

24

 

 

COVID-19 and other similar health crisis

 

The Company has been, and may in the future, be impacted by COVID-19 or any similar pandemic or health crisis, and this could affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow in the future. The extent and the effects of the impact of any of these events on the operation and financial performance of our business depend on several factors which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

  

13. COMMITMENTS

 

The Company does not have any commitments other than real property leases (Note 4).

 

14. REVOLUTION TRANSACTION

 

On December 3, 2022, Flex Revolution, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FlexShopper, Inc. (the “Buyer”) closed a transaction (“Revolution Transaction”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement with Revolution Financial, Inc., a provider of consumer loans and credit products (collectively with certain of its subsidiaries, “Revolution”), under which the Company acquired the material net assets of the Revolution business.

 

In consideration for the sale of the Revolution net assets, the Company issued an adjustable promissory note (“Seller Note”) with an initial principal amount of $5,000,000. The Seller Note matures on December 1, 2027, bears interest at 8% per annum and is subject to adjustment based upon the pre-tax net income of the acquired business in 2023. The fair value of the Seller Note as of the acquisition date was $3,421,991.

 

The Revolution Transaction includes the Buyer’s assumption of Revolution’s consumer loan portfolio, related cash and its credit facility (“Revolution Credit Facility”) as this facility is backed by the portfolio acquired. On June 7, 2023, the Revolution Credit Facility was legally transferred to FlexShopper (See Note 15).

 

The parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement have each made customary representations and warranties in the Asset Purchase Agreement and have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of such representations and warranties. The Buyer’s primary recourse in the event of a claim is to offset the Seller Note equal to the indemnifiable losses subject to such claim.

 

The Revolution Transaction has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combination. The Company measured the net assets acquired in Revolution Transaction at fair value on the acquisition date. 

 

The fair value of the intangible assets was determined primarily by using discounted cash flow models. The models use inputs including estimated cash flows and a discount rate.

 

The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of $14,461,274 related to the Revolution Transaction at acquisition date as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceed the fair value of the purchase price consideration. The Company believes that the most significant reason its management was able to negotiate a bargain purchase was due to the speed with which the seller wanted to close this transaction which resulted in a non-competitive process akin to a forced sale. The strong desire for a prior to year-end closing was for various reasons, including potential credit facility covenant issues and accelerating operating losses after recent regulatory changes.

 

On December 31, 2023, the promissory note related to acquisition was adjusted based upon the pre-tax loss of the acquired business in 2023 and based on this the Company recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023 a positive net change in fair value of promissory note related to acquisition of $3,678,689.

15. BASEPOINT CREDIT AGREEMENT

 

On June 7, 2023, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, Flex Revolution, LLC (the “New Borrower”) entered into a Joinder Agreement to a credit agreement (the “Basepoint Credit Agreement”) with Revolution Financial, Inc. (the “Existing Borrower”), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, the individual guarantor party and BP Fundco, LLC, as administrative agent.

 

The Existing Borrower with certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Seller”) and Flex Revolution, LLC (the “Buyer”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (See Note 14), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to, among other things, transfer substantially all of its assets to the Buyer.

 

In the Basepoint Credit Agreement, the New Borrower agreed to become a borrower (the “Basepoint Borrower”) and a grantor as applicable under the agreement. The Company is a guarantor of the Basepoint Credit Agreement.

 

The Basepoint Credit Agreement provides for an up to a $20 million credit facility for the origination of consumer loans. The credit facility is backed by eligible principal balance of eligible consumer receivable of the Basepoint borrower’s portfolio (the “Borrowing Base”). The annual interest rate on loans under the Basepoint Credit Agreement is 13.42%. The principal balance outstanding under the Basepoint Credit Agreement is due on June 7, 2026.

 

The Basepoint Credit Agreement includes covenants requiring the Basepoint Borrower and the guarantor to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity that is no less than 5% of the current Borrowing Base and maintain a minimum amount of cash held in the concentration accounts of $200,0000. The tangible net worth of the Basepoint Borrower and the guarantor shall not be less than 10% of the current Borrowing Base and the Basepoint Borrower and the guarantor shall maintain a positive consolidated net income. The terms tangible net worth and positive consolidated net income for the purpose of calculating the covenants under the Basepoint Credit Agreement are defined in the agreement. The Company is in compliance with Basepoint Credit Agreement covenants as of March 31, 2024.

 

The Basepoint Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the Basepoint Credit Agreement, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of the Basepoint Borrower in the Basepoint Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain covenants), deficiencies in the Borrowing Base, certain judgments against the Basepoint Borrower and bankruptcy events.

 

Interest expense incurred under the Basepoint Credit Agreement amounted to $261,614 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The outstanding balance under the Basepoint Credit Agreement was $7,412,605 as of March 31, 2024. Such amount is presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized issuance costs of $83,347 as of March 31, 2024. Interest is payable weekly on the outstanding balance of the amounts borrowed. No principal is expected to be repaid in the next twelve months, or from reductions in the borrowing base. Accordingly, all principal is shown as a non-current liability at March 31, 2024.

 

16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

 

The Company sponsors an employee retirement savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute, but not more than statutory limits. The Company makes nondiscretionary 4% Safe Harbor contributions of participants’ eligible earnings who have completed the plan’s eligibility requirements. The contributions are made to the plan on behalf of the employees. Total contributions to the plan were $49,707 and $50,161 for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

17. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

 

On May 17, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $2 million of the Company’s common stock. The Company may purchase common stock on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or by other means including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The timing and total amount of stock repurchases will depend upon business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. The share repurchase program will have a term of 18 months and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the company to acquire any amount of common stock. The objective of this program is to repurchases shares of common stock opportunistically when management believes that the Company’s stock is trading below the Company’s determination of long-term fair value. The shares of common stock when repurchased by the Company will become treasury shares.

 

The Company purchased under the share repurchase program 5,418 shares of common stock for a net cost of $6,098 for the three month ended March 31, 2024.

Concurrently, e-tailers and retailers FlexShopper’s may increase their sales by utilizing FlexShopper’s B2B channel to connect with consumers that want to acquire products on an LTO basis. FlexShopper’s LTO sales channels include (1) selling directly to consumers via the online FlexShopper.com marketplace featuring thousands of durable goods, (2) utilizing our LTO payment method at check-out on our partners’ e-commerce sites and (3) facilitating LTO transactions with retailers in their physical locations both through their in-store terminals and FlexShopper applications accessed via the Internet.

 

In 2021, we began to offer an unsecured, consumer loan product for our bank partner. In the bank partner origination model, applicants who apply and obtain a loan through our online platform are underwritten, approved, and funded by the bank partner. The product provides flexibility for FlexShopper to offer loans in retailer channels that provide services in addition to durable goods (e.g., tire retailers that provide car repair services) or in states which do not have lease purchase agreement regulations. FlexShopper’s bank lending product leverages its marketing and servicing expertise and its partner bank’s national presence to enable improved credit access to consumers. We manage many aspects of the loan life cycle on behalf of its bank partner, including customer acquisition, underwriting and loan servicing. This relationship allows FlexShopper’s bank partner to leverage our customer acquisition channel, underwriting and service capabilities, which they would otherwise need to develop in-house. The bank partner uses their own capital to originate loans. The bank partner retains approval rights on all aspects of the program and are primarily responsible for regulatory and compliance oversight. Under the bank partner model, FlexShopper is compensated by the bank partner as a service provider for our role in delivering the technology and services to the bank partner to facilitate origination and servicing of loans throughout each loan’s lifecycle. FlexShopper’s bank partner holds loans originated on our platform. FlexShopper acquires participation rights in such loans ranging from 95 to 100% of the loan. FlexShopper is able to repurpose its technology as well as marketing, underwriting and servicing experience gained from the LTO business to facilitate bank partner originations. The Company’s bank partner for the loan partner loan model chose to exit the high APR business in 2023. The Company is actively working on onboarding a new bank partner for this loan model.

 

In late 2022, FlexShopper purchased the assets of Revolution Financial, Inc. (“Revolution”). This purchase facilitated the creation of a direct origination model for consumers in 11 states. In the direct origination model, applicants who apply and obtain a loan through our platform are underwritten, approved, and funded directly by FlexShopper. Also acquired in the purchase were 22 leases for Revolution operated stores, as well as program agreements with 78 additional brick and mortar locations that share net revenue of the loans originated in those locations. In addition, we entered into an agreement to be the exclusive provider of non-prime loans to consumers in Liberty Tax corporate and franchisee locations nationwide. FlexShopper also purchased a portfolio of current customers and information on previous customers in order to market consumer products. FlexShopper is able to repurpose its technology, as well as marketing, underwriting and servicing experience gained from the LTO, business to facilitate loan originations in these locations.

 

During the first quarter of 2024, FlexShopper launched a new initiative to offer alternative lender’s payment options on Flexshopper.com marketplace to broaden the reach to a wider set of customers, both above and below the current credit segment served by FlexShopper leases. In this initiative (retail sales), FlexShopper sells the items and makes a profit on the product margin.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies

 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to credit provisions, intangible assets, contingencies, litigation, fair value of loan receivables and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience as well as various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

 

Lease Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - FlexShopper seeks to collect amounts owed under its leases from each customer on a weekly or biweekly basis by charging their bank accounts or credit cards. Lease receivables are principally comprised of lease payments currently owed to FlexShopper which are past due, as FlexShopper has been unable to successfully collect in the manner described above. An allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated primarily based upon historical collection experience that considers both the aging of the lease and the origination channel. Other qualitative factors are considered in estimating the allowance, such as seasonality, underwriting changes, and other business trends. The lease receivables balances consisted of the following as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 

                                                                                                        March 31,      December 31,   

                                                                                                          2024             2023

                                                                                                                                      

Lease receivables                                                                                    $    76,748,221  $    64,749,918 

Allowance for doubtful accounts                                                                          (27,432,189)     (19,954,828)

The allowance is a significant percentage of the balance because FlexShopper does not charge off any customer account until it has exhausted all collection efforts with respect to each account, including attempts to repossess items. Lease receivables balances charged off against the allowance were $2,006,688 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $18,971,772 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Loan receivables at fair value – The Company elected the fair value option on its entire loan and loan participation receivables portfolio. As such, loan receivables are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accrued and unpaid interest and fees are included in loan receivables at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the reporting of these receivables at fair value more closely approximates the true economics of the loan.

 

Interest and fees are discontinued when loans receivable become contractually 90 or more days past due. The Company charges-off loans at the earlier of when the loans are determined to be uncollectible or when the loans are 90 days contractually past due. Recoveries on loan receivables that were previously charged off are recognized when cash is received. Changes in the fair value of loan receivables include the impact of current period charge offs associated with these receivables. 

 

The Company estimates the fair value of the loan receivables using a discounted cash flow analysis at an individual loan level to more accurately predict future payments. The Company adjusts expected cash flows for estimated losses and servicing costs over the estimated duration of the underlying assets. These adjustments are determined using historical data and include appropriate consideration of recent trends and anticipated future performance. Future cash flows are discounted using a rate of return that the Company believes a market participant would require. Model results may be adjusted by management if the Company does not believe the output reflects the fair value of the instrument, as defined under U.S. GAAP. The models are updated at each measurement date to capture any changes in internal factors such as nature, term, volume, payment trends, remaining time to maturity, and portfolio mix, as well as changes in underwriting or observed trends expected to impact future performance.

We refer to Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA in the above tables as we use these measures to evaluate our operating performance and make strategic decisions about the Company. Management believes that Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry in assessing performance.

 

Gross Profit represents GAAP revenue less depreciation and impairment of lease merchandise, less loans originations costs and fees, and less cost of retail revenues. Gross Profit provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business. We use Gross Profit to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance. This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income/ (loss) before interest, stock-based compensation, taxes, depreciation (other than depreciation of leased merchandise), amortization and one-time or non-recurring items. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because this measure:

 

     ●    is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the

           calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to

           company.

           

     ●    is a financial measurement that is used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our credit worthiness; and

           

     ●    is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning

           and

           forecasting.

 

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of FlexShopper’s performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP metrics such as operating income/ (loss), net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

Net loan revenues for our bank partner loan model for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $4,695,183 compared to $3,856,306 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $838,877 or 21.8%. The increase is mainly due to an update of the Company’s best estimate of the estimated losses assumption a market participant would use to calculate the fair value of this loan portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company started placing the bank partner’s loans in default to a third-party collector, which resulted in an update on the cash flow model used in the fair value calculation. Our bank partner originated 166 loans for three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company’s bank partner for the loan partner loan model chose to exit the high APR business in 2023. The Company is actively working on onboarding a new bank partner for this loan model.

As the Company’s lease portfolio and revenues decrease, the depreciation and related costs associated with the smaller portfolio also decrease. Asset level performance within the portfolio, as well as the mix of early paid off leases, will alter the average depreciable term of the leases within the portfolio and result in increases or decreases in cost of lease revenue and merchandise sold relative to lease revenue.

Operations

 

We promote our FlexShopper lease products across all sales channels through strategic partnerships, direct response marketing, and affiliate and internet marketing, all of which are designed to increase our lease transactions. Our advertisements emphasize such features as instant spending limits and affordable weekly payments. We believe that as the FlexShopper name gains familiarity and national recognition through our advertising efforts, we will continue to educate our customers and potential customers about the lease-to-own payment alternative as well as solidify our reputation as a leading provider of high-quality branded merchandise and services.

 

For each of our sales channels, FlexShopper has a marketing strategy that includes the following:

 

            Online LTO Marketplace                      Patent LTO Payment Method               In-store LTO technology platform

  Search engine optimization; pay-per click          Direct to retailers/e-retailers             Direct to retailers/e-retailers

          Online affiliate networks               Partnerships with payment aggregators       Consultants & strategic relationships

     Direct response television campaigns         Consultants & strategic relationships                          

                 Direct mail                                                                

 

The Company believes it has a competitive advantage over competitors in the LTO industry by providing all three channels as a bundled package to retailers and e-retailers. Management is anticipating a rapid development of the FlexShopper business as we are able to penetrate each of our sales channels.

In 2021, we began to market an unsecured, consumer loan product for our bank partner. In the bank partner origination model, applicants who apply and obtain a loan through our online platform are underwritten, approved, and funded by the bank partner. FlexShopper is able to repurpose its technology as well as marketing, underwriting and servicing experience gained from the LTO business to facilitate bank partner originations. The Company’s bank partner for the loan partner loan model chose to exit the high APR business in 2023. The Company is actively working on onboarding a new bank partner for this loan model.

 

In late 2022, FlexShopper purchased the assets of Revolution Financial, Inc.. This purchase facilitated the creation of a direct origination model for consumers in 11 states. In the direct origination model, applicants who apply and obtain a loan through our platform are underwritten, approved, and funded directly by FlexShopper.

 

During the first quarter of 2024, FlexShopper launched a new initiative to offer alternative lender’s payment options on Flexshopper.com marketplace to broaden the reach to a wider set of customers, both above and below the current credit segment served by FlexShopper leases. In this initiative (retail sales), FlexShopper sells the items and makes a profit on the product margin.

 

To support our anticipated growth, FlexShopper will need the availability of substantial capital resources. See the section captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $5,593,750 compared to $9,861,646 at the same date in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $4,413,130. The increase in cash from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the cash generated by the portfolio and the reduction in originations. 

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had lease receivables of $76,748,221 offset by an allowance for doubtful accounts of $27,432,189, resulting in net accounts receivable of $49,316,032.

Credit Agreement

 

On March 6, 2015, FlexShopper, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Borrower”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended from time-to-time, the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and WE 2014-1, LLC, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, as administrative agent and lender (“Lender”). On September 2022, WE 2014-1, LLC assigned 100% of its Commitments and all Loans to Powerscourt Investments 32, LP, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC. The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed was SOFR plus 11% per annum. The Commitment Termination Date was April 1, 2024.

 

On March 27, 2024, the Company refinanced all the obligations under the Credit Agreement owed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and all liens held by any of the Lenders, or the Administrative Agent were discharged and released. The Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Company terminated the Credit Agreement.

 

On March 27, 2024, FlexShopper, through a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Borrower”), entered into a new credit agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”) with Computershare Trust Company, National Association as paying agent, various lenders from time to time party thereto and Powerscourt Investment 50, LP, an affiliate of Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, as administrative agent and lender (“Lender”). The Borrower is permitted to borrow funds under the 2024 Credit Agreement based on FlexShopper’s cash on hand and the Amortized Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) less certain deductions described in the 2024 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to $150,000,000 from the Lender until the Commitment Termination Date and must repay all borrowed amounts one year thereafter, on the date that is 12 months following the Commitment Termination Date (unless such amounts become due or payable on an earlier date pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement). The Commitment Termination Date is April 1, 2026. The Lender was granted a security interest in certain leases and loans as collateral under this Agreement. The interest rate charged on amounts borrowed is SOFR plus 9% per annum. The Company will pay the Lender a fee in an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate Commitments as of March 27, 2024, payable in 12 monthly installments on each interest payment date commencing April 2024. At March 31, 2024, amounts borrowed bear interest at 14.44%.

 

The 2024 Credit Agreement provides that FlexShopper may not incur additional indebtedness (other than expressly permitted indebtedness) without the permission of the Lender, and also prohibits payments of cash dividends on common stock. Additionally, the 2024 Credit Agreement includes covenants requiring FlexShopper to maintain a minimum amount of Equity Book Value, Liquidity and Cash, and maintain a certain ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Equity Book Value (each capitalized term, as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). Upon a Permitted Change of Control, FlexShopper must refinance the debt under the 2024 Credit Agreement, subject to the payment of an early termination fee.

The 2024 Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, failures to make payment of principal and interest, breaches or defaults under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Lender, breaches of representations, warranties or certifications made by or on behalf of FlexShopper in the 2024 Credit Agreement and related documents (including certain financial and expense covenants), deficiencies in the borrowing base, certain judgments against FlexShopper and bankruptcy events.

 

The Company borrowed under the Credit Agreement and under the 2024 Credit Agreement $10,611,690 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $2,750,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company repaid under the Credit Agreement and under 2024 Credit Agreement $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $2,575,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The outstanding balance under the 2024 Credit Agreement was $107,066,690 as of March 31, 2024 and was $96,455,000 under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. Such amount is presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,500,000 and $70,780 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest is payable monthly on the outstanding balance of the amounts borrowed. No principal is expected to be repaid in the next twelve months due to the Commitment Termination Date having been extended to April 1, 2026, or from reductions in the borrowing base.

On January 25, 2019, FlexShopper, LLC (the “Promissory Note Borrower”) entered into a subordinated debt financing letter agreement with 122 Partners, LLC, as lender, pursuant to which the Promissory Note Borrower issued a subordinated promissory note to 122 Partners, LLC (the “122 Partners Note”) in the principal amount of $1,000,000. H. Russell Heiser, Jr., FlexShopper’s Chief Executive Officer, is a member of 122 Partners, LLC. On March 30, 2023, the Promissory Note Borrower executed a fourth amendment to the 122 Partners Note such that the maturity date of the 122 Partners Note was extended from April 1, 2023 to October 1, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the Promissory Note Borrower paid all the principal and interest outstanding as of that date.

 

The Promissory Note Borrower previously entered into letter agreements with NRNS Capital Holdings LLC (“NRNS”), the manager of which is the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, pursuant to which the Borrower issued subordinated promissory notes to NRNS (the “NRNS Note”) in the total principal amount of $3,750,000. Payment of principal and accrued interest under the NRNS Note was due and payable by the Borrower on June 30, 2021 and the Promissory Note Borrower can prepay principal and interest at any time without penalty. At March 31, 2024, amounts outstanding under the NRNS Note bear interest at a rate of 19.44%. Obligations under the NRNS Note are subordinated to obligations under the Credit Agreement. The NRNS Note is subject to customary representations and warranties and events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Promissory Note Borrower may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the NRNS Note. Obligations under the NRNS Note is secured by substantially all of the Promissory Note Borrower’s assets, subject to rights of the lenders under the Credit Agreement. On March 22, 2021, the Promissory Note Borrower executed an amendment to the NRNS Note such that the maturity date was extended to April 1, 2022. On February 2, 2022, the Promissory Note Borrower executed another amendment to the NRNS Note. This last amendment extended the maturity date from April 1, 2022 to July 1, 2024 and increased the credit commitment from $3,750,000 to $11,000,000.

To induce NRNS into the Amendment, the Company extended the expiration date of certain warrants (See Note 9). The cost of the warrant modification was $917,581 and was recorded as a deferred debt cost of NRNS note. No other changes were made to such NRNS Note. As of March 31, 2024, $10,948,398 of principal and accrued and unpaid interest was outstanding on the NRNS Note.

Capital Resources and Financial Condition

 

To date, funds derived from the sale of the Company’s common stock, warrants, Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock, proceeds from promissory notes to related parties and the Company’s ability to borrow funds against the lease and loan portfolio have provided the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its operations.

 

Management believes that liquidity needs for future growth through at least the next 12 months can be met by cash flow from operations generated by the existing portfolio and/or additional borrowings against the Credit Agreement (see Note 8).

 

Financial Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

 

As of May 13, 2024, the Company is not experiencing any material impact from the COVID-19 Pandemic. However, our business has been, and may in the future be, impacted by COVID-19 or any similar pandemic or health crisis, and this could affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow in the future.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 

Not applicable.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.

 

In connection with our December 31, 2023 financial statements, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness was due to a lack of effective controls over the review of certain accounts calculations related to the tax provision as developed by a third-party service provider. The tax provision is a complex calculation for the Company mainly because there are several different state tax regulations to take into consideration, the business combination occurred in 2022, and the recent changes to the tax interest limitation.

 

The Company has taken efforts and actions during the first quarter of 2024 to remediate the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023. These actions included the change of the tax third party service provider and the Company expects to complete the remediation efforts in the second quarter of 2024.

 

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level at March 31, 2024.

 

Other than the efforts and actions taken to remediate the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023, there were no other changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

 

We are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may, however, be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time.

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

 

On May 17, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $2 million of the Company’s common stock. The Company may purchase common stock on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or by other means including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The timing and total amount of stock repurchases will depend upon business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. The share repurchase program will have a term of 18 months and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the company to acquire any amount of common stock. The objective of this program is to repurchases shares of common stock opportunistically when management believes that the Company’s stock is trading below the Company’s determination of long-term fair value. The shares of common stock when repurchased by the Company will become treasury shares.
