Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on our management’s current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in plans that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. You should be aware that, as a result of any of these factors materializing, the trading price of our common stock may decline. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

●         the availability and adequacy of capital to support and grow our business;

●         economic, competitive, business and other conditions in our local and regional markets;

HAPI METAVERSE INC. (FORMERLY KNOWN AS GIGWORLD INC.) 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1. ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

 

Hapi Metaverse Inc., formerly GigWorld Inc. (the “Company” or “Group”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. The Company’s business is focused on serving business-to-business (B2B) needs in e-commerce, collaboration and social networking functions. The Company also started its Food and Beverage (“F&B”) business in 2022 and its travel business in 2023.

 

Going Concern

 

These financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses of $17,156,259 and has net working capital deficit of $5,776,874 at March 31, 2024. Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations and believes that its current cash balance along with its current operations will not provide sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth, management of operating expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.

 

Our majority shareholder has advised us not to depend solely on them for financing. The Company has increased its efforts to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings from other sources. However, the Company cannot be certain that such capital (from its shareholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to the Company. Any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.

 

In considering our forecast for the next twelve months and the current cash and working capital as of the filing of this Form 10-Q, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to meet their financial needs and continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

 

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of presentation

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and additional information as contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on April 1, 2024. Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The other information in these condensed consolidated financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise.

 

Basis of consolidation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns more than 50% of the voting common stock and controls operations. All intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.

 

                                                                   9



                                                         

 

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the following entities as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as follows:

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues, cost and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

 

Cash and cash equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.

 

Leases

 

The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 842 in accounting for its operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of a consideration. To assess whether a contract is or contains a lease, the Company assess whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset, whether it has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset and whether it has the right to control the use of the asset. The right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. The Company recognizes operating lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

                                                                   11



                                                         

 

The Company has also utilized the following practical expedients:

 

     ●    Short-term leases – for leases that are for a period of 12 months or less, the Company will not apply the recognition

           requirements of ASC

           842.

     ●    For leases that contain related non-lease components, such as maintenance, the Company will account for these payments as a

           single lease

           component.

 

Right-of-use of assets

 

The right-of-use of asset is measured at cost, which comprises the amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentive received.

 

Lease liabilities

 

Lease liability is measured at the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the Company incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise mainly fixed lease payments.

 

Foreign currency risk

 

Because of its foreign operations, the Company holds cash in non-US dollars. As of March 31,2024, cash of the Group includes, on an as converted basis to US dollars, $368,450, $47,356 and $4,886, in Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), Singapore Dollars (“S$”), and Chinese Yuan (“CN ¥”) respectively. As of December 31,2023, cash of the Group includes, on an as converted basis to US dollars, $589,593, $10,704 and $11,327, in Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), Singapore Dollars (“S$”), and Chinese Yuan (“CN ¥”) respectively.

 

Investment in Securities at Fair Value – Related Party

 

The Company currently has an investment in VEII, a related party, consisting of common shares and warrants. The Company had elected the fair value option, or “FVO,” and the Company continues to measure at fair value, those of its assets and liabilities it had previously measured at fair value and for which such election is permitted, and the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the asset, or that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized (such as removal, and restoration costs). When property and equipment is retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method (after considering their respective estimated residual values) over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

Concentrations

 

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. Although the cash at each particular bank in the United States is insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Group is exposed to risk due to its concentration of cash in foreign countries. The Group places its cash with financial institutions with high-credit ratings and quality.

 

Fair value

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 

The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories:

 

     ●    Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

           

     ●    Level 2 – observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

           

     ●    Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop

           its own

           assumptions.

 

Revenue recognition

 

Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services or catering service to customers.

 

Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services or catering service to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services or catering service to its customers. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services or catering service in the contract by analyzing customer perspective, immateriality, implicit promises, setup activities, and marketing incentives; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services or catering service are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract by analyze the contract from the perspective of the customer; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration by the expected value method and the most likely amount method ; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances ; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. This should only be done once the transaction is complete and your obligation is fulfilled. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services or catering service it transfers to the customer.

 

                                                                   13



                                                         

 

Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred.

 

The Company began generating revenue from the food and beverage (“F&B”) business by providing quality catering services in HK since October 2022 and in the PRC since January 2023.

 

A project providing services to Value Exchange Int’l (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of Value Exchange International, Inc. (“VEII”) located in Hong Kong, on a monthly basis in 2022. VEII is a related party of the Company. Upon receipt of purchase order from this customer, we issue the corresponding invoice and provide the service accordingly. Any payment received from this customer in advance is presented within other payables on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. This service was terminated on June 30, 2023 and $0 of contract liabilities remained as of March 31, 2024. The balance of customer deposits at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $0, March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was $7,679, and $2,802, respectively.

 

In June 2023, the Company acquired a travel business and began generating revenue by providing travel packaging and ticketing services in HK.

 

Income taxes

 

Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as non-current in accordance with ASC 740.

 

The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes. The Group did not recognize any income tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023, respectively.

 

Foreign currency translation

 

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“functional currency”).

 

The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (“U.S. dollar”). The financial records of the Company’s subsidiaries located in Singapore, Hong Kong and Mainland China are maintained in their local currencies, the Singapore Dollar (S$), Hong Kong Dollar (HK$) and Chinese Yuan (CN ¥), which are also the functional currencies of these entities.

 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the year are converted into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occurred. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

The Company’s entities with functional currency of Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar and Chinese Yuan, translate their operating results and financial positions into the U.S. dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss).

 

                                                                   14



                                                         

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded other comprehensive gain from a translation gain of $69,375 in the consolidated financial statements. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded other comprehensive loss from a translation loss of ($18,082) in the consolidated financial statements.

 

Comprehensive income (loss)

 

Comprehensive income (loss) includes gains (losses) from foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) is reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

Earnings (Loss) per share

 

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

 

The calculation of diluted net income per unit includes the effects of the assumed conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible debt, except during the loss periods as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

 

Non-controlling interests

 

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company, and are presented separately in the condensed consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income, and within equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, separately from equity attributable to owners of the Company.

 

On March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate non-controlling interests in the Company were $(3,989) and $(3,449), respectively.

 

Recent accounting pronouncement

 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 7. GOODWILL

 

The Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions that align with the Company’s plans, namely, starting the F&B business in Asia. Starting an F&B business in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan can be an excellent opportunity due to the large consumer market, diverse food culture, high demand for international cuisine, favorable business environment, skilled labor force, and opportunities for growth. On October 4, 2022, The Company has completed its first F&B business acquisition of MOC HK Limited (“MOC”), a F&B business started in Hong Kong. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entity from its acquisition date. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition is initially allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated acquisition date fair values.

 

As a result of the acquisition of MOC, goodwill of $60,343 generated in a business combination represents the purchase price of $70,523 in excess of identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead they are reviewed periodically for impairment.

 

The Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment losses.

 

The following table summarizes changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the years ended December 31, 2023.

Note 8. LEASES

 

The Company has operating leases for its F&B stores and warehouse in Hong Kong. The related lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Since the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be readily determined, management uses a discount rate based on the incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term relating to its operating leases are 1.36 years, with a weighted-average discount rate of the 4.4%.

 

                                                                   19

Background and business

 

Hapi Metaverse Inc., formerly known as GigWorld Inc. (the “Company” or “Group”), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012. The Company’s initial business plan was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented industries. Our Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company to expand our business plan. On October 15, 2014, through a sale and purchase agreement, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding stock of HotApp BlockChain Pte. Ltd., formerly known as HotApps International Pte Ltd (“HIP”) from Alset International Limited (“AIL”), formerly known as Singapore eDevelopment Limited. AIL is our former largest stockholder. HIP owned certain intellectual property relating to instant messaging for portable devices (referred to herein as the “HotApp Application”). On August 30, 2022, AIL entered into a stock purchase with its controlling stockholder, Alset Inc. (formerly known as Alset EHome International Inc.) in relation to the disposal of 505,341,376 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 99.69% of the total issued and paid-up share capital of the Company, to Alset Inc. After this transaction, Alset Inc. became our largest stockholder.

 

The HotApp Application is a cross-platform mobile application that incorporates instant messaging and ecommerce. This application can be used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS Online or Android). The HotApp Application offered messaging and calling services for HotApp Application users (text, photo, audio); however, the messaging and calling services we offered were terminated in 2017.

 

In December of 2017, the Company’s name was changed from “HotApp International, Inc.” to “HotApp Blockchain Inc.” to reflect the Board of Directors’ determination that it was in the best interest of the Company to expand its activities to include the development and commercialization of blockchain-related technologies.

 

In 2018, one of our main developments was a broadening of our scope of planned operations into a digital transformation technology business. As a digital transformation technology business, we are committed to enabling enterprises we work with to engage in a digital transformation by providing consulting, implementation and development services with various technologies, including instant messaging, blockchain, e-commerce, social media and payment solutions. We continue to advise businesses in network marketing and brands in block chain services and mobile collaboration.

 

                                                                   21



 

 

We are focused on serving business-to-business (B2B) needs in e-commerce, collaboration and supply chains. We will help enterprises and community users to transform their business model with digital economy in a more effective manner. With our platform, users can discover and build their own communities and create valuable content. Enterprises can in turn enhance the user experience with premium content, all of which are facilitated by the transactions of every stakeholder via e-commerce.

 

Our technology platform consists of instant messaging systems, social media, e-commerce and payment systems, network marketing platforms and e-real estate. We are focused on business-to-business solutions such as enterprise messaging and workflow. We have successfully implemented several strategic platform developments for clients, including a mobile front-end solution for network marketing, a hotel e-commerce platform for Asia and a real estate agent management platform in China. We have also enhanced our technological capability from mobile application development to include blockchain architectural design, allowing mobile-friendly front-end solutions to integrate with software platforms. Our main digital assets at the present time are our applications. We continue to strengthen our technology architecture and develop Application Development Interface (API) for collaboration partners such as network marketing back end service providers. In addition we are continuing our development activities in blockchain in order to prepare for future client opportunities.

 

In February of 2021, the Company’s name was changed to “GigWorld Inc.”

 

The Group has relied significantly on AIL, our former majority stockholder, as its principal sources of funding during the period. AIL, and later, our current majority stockholder, Alset Inc., advised us not to depend solely on it for financing. We have increased our efforts to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings from other sources. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our stockholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Any such, financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.

 

On April 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Value Exchange International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“VEII”) pursuant to which the Company purchased 6.5 million restricted shares of VEII Common Stock from VEII for an aggregate purchase price of $650,000. The closing of the transaction occurred on April 12, 2021. Pursuant to this Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company was entitled to appoint one nominee to the Board of Directors of VEII. The Company appointed Mr. Lum Kan Fai as its nominee. Mr. Lum is the Vice Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors. VEII is a provider of customer-centric technology solutions for the retail industry in Hong Kong and certain regions of China and Philippines. On October 17, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Chan Heng Fai, who is the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder of Alset Inc., the Company’s majority stockholder. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company bought an aggregate of 7,276,163 shares of VEII. The Company presently owns approximately 48.68% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Value Exchange International Inc.

 

In July of 2021, the Company’s indirect subsidiary HotApp International Limited incorporated Smart Reward Express Limited (“Smart Reward”) in Hong Kong. Smart Reward plans to be principally engaged in the business of developing a platform allowing small and medium sized merchants to set-up their own reward program, with the aim of creating a loyalty exchange program for participating merchants.

 

HotApp International Limited is the owner of 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Smart Reward. The remaining 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Smart Reward are held by Value Exchange Int’l (China) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VEII.

 

On July 5, 2022, Hapi Cafe Limited (“HCHK”) was incorporated. HCHK is be principally engaged in the food and beverage business in Hong Kong.

 

                                                                   22



 

 

On October 5, 2022, HCHK acquired MOC HK Limited (“MOC”) and is principally engaged in the food and beverage business in Hong Kong.

 

On October 10, 2022, Shenzhen Leyouyou Catering Management Co., Ltd. (“HCCN”) was incorporated in People’s Republic of China and is principally engaged in the food and beverage business in Mainland China.

 

In March of 2023, the Company’s name was changed from “GigWorld Inc.” to “Hapi Metaverse Inc.” to reflect the Board of Directors’ determination that it was in the best interest of the Company to position itself as a Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) provider, reflecting its latest strategy embracing Metaverse, A.I., and offline engagement for communities and brands.

 

Transactions between Entities under Common Control

 

On June 14, 2023, the Company completed its online travel business acquisition of Hapi Travel Limited, an online travel business started in Hong Kong and under common control of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entity from its acquisition date. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition is initially allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated acquisition date fair values. The recorded amounts for assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional and subject to change during the measurement period, which is up to 12 months from the acquisition date.

 

As a result of the acquisition of HTL, a deemed dividend of $214,174 was generated as a result of the business combination which represents the purchase price of $214,993 in excess of identifiable equity.

 

The common control transaction above resulted in the following basis of accounting for the financial reporting periods:

 

     ●    The acquisition of HTL was accounted for prospectively as of June 14, 2023 as this did not represent a change in reporting

           entity.

 

The acquisition of HTL was under common control and was consolidated in accordance with ASC 850-50. The Consolidated financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of HTL as of January 1, 2022 for comparative purposes because the historical operations of HTL were deemed to be immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company began generating revenue from a project providing AI chatbot services to Value Exchange Int’l (Hong Kong) Limited, a related company of the company and a subsidiary of VEII located in Hong Kong, on a monthly basis in 2022. Additional revenue also generated from F&B business, MOC and HCDG were $44,723 and $48,523, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. And revenue generated from Travel business, HTL, were $2,380 and $0 respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Total revenues were $47,103 and $62,563, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the termination of AI chatbot service on June 30, 2023.

 

Cost of revenue

 

Cost of revenue consists primarily of outside service fees incurred directly to the project. Total cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0 and $4,568, respectively. The cost from F&B revenue were $14,054 and $18,980 respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, of which $0 and $4,813 were depreciation for leasehold improvement respectively. The cost from Travel revenue were $2,370 and $0 respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Total cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $16,424 and $23,548, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue is due to the termination of AI chatbot service on June 30, 2023.

 

Operating Expenses

 

Operating expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits, professional fees, consulting expenses and maintenance expenses of existing software framework. We expect to maintain our operating expenses with moderate changes in line with business activities. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $320,849 and $254,324, of which $977 and $471 were depreciation expenses and $2,411 and $3,929 were rent expenses, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the increase in consulting expenses for the exploration of new project and new market, and $121,002 increase of salaries expenses due to the expansion in the F&B and Travel business.

 

                                                                   25



 

 

Other Income (Expense)

 

Total other income (expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were ($3,452,417) and ($1,026,855), of which $22,141 and $11,056 in interest income, ($3,386,702) and ($1,033,212) in unrealized loss on securities investment, $3,122 and $1 in other income, ($40,390) and ($11,047) in interest expenses, and ($50,588) and $6,347 in foreign exchange gain, respectively. The increase of other expenses was mainly due to $2,353,490 increase of expenses due to the fair value loss of VEII shares and warrants.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, we had cash of $567,090 and a working capital deficit of $5,776,874. The increase in the working capital deficit during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to the increase in the loss on investment in securities.

 

We had a total stockholders’ deficit of $6,236,877 and an accumulated deficit of $17,156,259 as of March 31, 2024 compared with a total stockholders’ deficit of $2,563,665 and an accumulated deficit of $13,414,222 as of December 31, 2023. This difference is primarily due to the net loss incurred during the period.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded a net loss of $3,742,587.

 

We had net cash used in operating activities of $410,291 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. We had a negative change of $29,301 due to accounts receivable, $2,850 due to prepaid expenses and $43,550 due to change in operating lease liability and $23,197 due to accounts payable and accrued expenses. A positive change of $3,386,702 due to unrealized loss on security investment, $44,018 in non-cash lease expenses.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $1,242,164.

 

We had net cash used in operating activities of $155,034 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We had a negative change of $25,936 due to accounts receivable, $6,779 due to prepaid expenses and $22,310 due to change in operating lease liability. A positive change of $1,033,213 due to unrealized loss on security investment, $23,507 in non-cash lease expenses and $58,292 due to accounts payable and accrued expenses.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had net cash provided by financial activities of $243,009, of which $243,009 was due to advances from related parties. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net cash provided by financial activities of $122,719, of which $122,719 was due to advances from related parties.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we have fixed operating office lease agreements in Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China.

 

We will need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our largest shareholder or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on a term that is acceptable to us. Any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial and operating covenants that would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient funds to operate our business and pursue our business plan.

 

We have included disclosures which discuss the matters which create substantial doubt as to whether we will be able to continue to operate as a going concern including the facts that the Company has incurred net operating losses of $14,690,424 from inception though March 31, 2024 and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

 

                                                                   26



 

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and income taxes. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date.

 

Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.

 

Revenue recognition

 

Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services or catering service to customers.

 

Revenue is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services or catering service to its customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services or catering service to its customers. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services or catering service in the contract by analyzing customer perspective, immateriality, implicit promises, setup activities, and marketing incentives; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services or catering service are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract by analyze the contract from the perspective of the customer; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration by the expected value method and the most likely amount method; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. This should only be done once the transaction is complete and your obligation is fulfilled. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services or catering service it transfers to the customer.

 

Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred.

 

The Company began generating revenue from the food and beverage (“F&B”) business by providing quality catering services in HK since October 2022 and in the PRC since January 2023.

 

A project providing services to Value Exchange Int’l (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of Value Exchange International, Inc. (“VEII”) located in Hong Kong, on a monthly basis in 2022. VEII is a related party of the Company. Upon receipt of purchase order from this customer, we issue the corresponding invoice and provide the service accordingly. Any payment received from this customer in advance is presented within other payables on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. This service was terminated on June 30, 2023 and $0 of contract liabilities remained as of March 31, 2024. The balance of customer deposits at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $0, March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was $7,679, and $2,802, respectively.

 

In June 2023, the Company acquired a travel business and began generating revenue by providing travel packaging and ticketing services in HK.

 

                                                                   27



 

 

Income taxes

 

Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as non-current based on their characteristics.

 

The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes. The Group did not recognize any income tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for the period ended March 31, 2024 or 2023, respectively.

 

Investment in Securities – related party

 

The Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with pursuant to which the Company purchased 6,500,000 and 7,276,163 shares of Value Exchange International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“VEII”) on April 8, 2021 and October 17, 2022 respectively.

 

On January 27, 2023, the Company and New Electric CV Corporation (together with the Company, the “Lenders”) entered into a Convertible Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with VEII. The Credit Agreement provides VEII with a maximum credit line of $1,500,000 (“Maximum Credit Line”) with simple interest accrued on any advances of the money under the Credit Agreement at 8%. The principal amount of any advance of money under the Credit Agreement (each being referred to as an “Advance”) is due in a lump sum, balloon payment on the third annual anniversary of the date of the Advance (“Advance Maturity Date”). Accrued and unpaid interest on any Advance is due and payable on a semi-annual basis with interest payments due on the last business day of June and last business day of December of each year. A Lender may demand that any portion or all of the unpaid principal amount of any Advance as well as accrued and unpaid interest thereon may be paid by shares of VEII Common Stock in lieu of cash payment.

 

VEII must request Advances from the Lenders. Either Lender may elect to separately, fully fund the Advance, or both Lenders may jointly elect to fund the Advance based on Lenders’ agreement on the portion of the Advance to be funded by each Lender. Lenders may severally or jointly reject any request for an Advance and neither Lender has an obligation to fund any Advance under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will determine how much to loan to VEII pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

 

The Credit Agreement grants conversion rights to each Lender. Each Advance shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of VEII Common Stock at the option of the Lender who made that Advance (being referred to as a “Conversion”), at any time and from time to time, at a price per share equal the “Conversion Price” (as defined below). The Conversion Price for a Conversion shall be the average closing price of the VEII Common Stock for the three (3) consecutive trading days prior to date of the Notice of Conversion. The Lenders shall also have certain conversion rights upon a change of control of VEII, or a breach of the Credit Agreement by VEII.

 

In the event that a Lender elects to convert any portion of an Advance into shares of VEII Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that Advance, then VEII would issue to the Lender five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII Common Stock issued in a Conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the Lender to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant.

 

                                                                   28



 

 

On February 23, 2023, Hapi Metaverse loaned VEII $1,400,000 (the “Loan Amount”). The Loan Amount can be converted into shares of VEII pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Credit Agreement for a period of three years. There is no fixed price for the derivative security until Hapi Metaverse converts the Loan Amount into shares of VEII Common Stock.

 

On September 6, 2023, the Company converted $1,300,000 of the principal amount loaned to VEII into 7,344,632 shares of VEII’s common stock. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company received common stock warrants to purchase a maximum of 36,723,160 shares of VEII common stock at an exercise price of $0.1770 per share. Such warrants expire five (5) years from date of their issuance.

 

On December 14, 2023, the company entered into a Convertible Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with VEII. On December 15, 2023, the company loaned VEII $1,000,000. The Credit Agreement was amended pursuant to an agreement dated December 19, 2023. Under the Credit Agreement, as amended, this amount can be converted into shares of VEII pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Credit Agreement for a period of three years. In the event that the company converts this loan into shares of VEII Common Stock, the conversion price shall be $0.045 per share. In the event that the company elects to convert any portion of the loan into shares of VEII Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in satisfaction of that loan, then VEII will issue to the company five (5) detachable warrants for each share of VEII Common Stock issued in a conversion (“Warrants”). Each Warrant will entitle the company to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years from date of issuance of the Warrant. At the time of this filing, the company has not converted the Loan Amount.

 

Our Chairman, Chan Heng Fai, and another member of our Board of Directors, Lum Kan Fai, are both members of the Board of Directors of VEII. In addition to Mr. Chan, two other members of the Board of Directors of our majority stockholder, Alset Inc., are also members of the Board of Directors of VEII (Mr. Wong Shui Yeung and Mr. Wong Tat Keung). The Company currently owns a total of 21,120,795 shares (representing 48.68%) of VEII. Which are recorded at fair value of $504,787 and $1,425,654 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. ($3,386,702) and ($1,033,212) in unrealized (loss) were recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

In connection with the preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of March 31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

During evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024 conducted as part of our preparation of our interim financial statements, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management determined that at March 31, 2024, we had material weaknesses: 1) in our internal control over financial reporting because our small accounting team; 2) lack of higher-level supervisory or review function, currently furnished by a related-party, manages both bookkeeping and accounting functions and therefore prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system.

 

                                                                   29
