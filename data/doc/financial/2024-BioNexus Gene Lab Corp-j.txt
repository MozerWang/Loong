CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements relate to anticipated future events, future results of operations and or future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by their use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “ought to,” “plan,” “possible,” “potentially,” “predicts,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” negatives of such terms or other similar terms. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements relating to:

 

     ●    our goals and strategies;

           

     ●    our future business development, results of operations and financial condition;

           

     ●    our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and our need for additional financing;

           

     ●    our estimates regarding the market opportunity for our services;

           

     ●    the impact of government laws and regulations;

           

     ●    our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel;

           

     ●    our failure to comply with regulatory guidelines;

           

     ●    uncertainty in industry demand;

           

     ●    general economic conditions and market conditions in the financial services industry;

           

     ●    future sales of large blocks or our securities, which may adversely impact our share price; and

           

     ●    depth of the trading market in our securities.

 

The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

You should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND

 

BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on May 12, 2017. On August 23, 2017, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of Bionexus Gene Lab Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian corporation (“BioNexus Malaysia”). BioNexus Malaysia was incorporated in Malaysia on April 7, 2015 and subsequently changed its name to MRNA Scientific Sdn. Bhd. (“MRNA Scientific”) on September 19, 2023.

 

The principal office address is Unit 02 Level 10, Tower B, Vertical Business Suite, No. 8 Jalan Kerinchi, Bangsar South, 59200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, our lab is located at Lab 353, Chemical Science Centre, University Science Malaysia, George Town, Penang, Malaysia. We also have a blood collection center located at 1st floor, Lifecare Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

 

On December 31, 2020, the Company consummated its acquisition of Chemrex Corporation Sdn. Bhd. (“Chemrex”), pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, Chemrex and the Chemrex shareholders wherein the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Chemrex from the Chemrex shareholders in exchange for 68,487,261 shares of common stock of the Company.

 

The acquisition of Chemrex has been accounted for as a common control transaction as there is no change in the control over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The net assets are derecognized by the transferring entity (i.e. Chemrex) and recognized by the receiving entity (i.e. the Company). The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying amounts of the net assets is recognized in equity.

 

The financial statements of the receiving entity report the results of operations for the period in which the transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests had occurred at the beginning of the period. Results of operations for that period will thus comprise those of the previously separate entities combined from the beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the combined operations from that date to the end of the period. The comparative financial statements were not adjusted retrospectively as Chemrex was not under common control during the comparative period.

 

The corporate structure as at March 31, 2024 is depicted below:

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

 

·    Basis of presentation

  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted.

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the period ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet information as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.

 

·    Basis of consolidation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bionexus Gene Lab Corp. and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

·    Use of estimates

 

In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported

 amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may

 differ from these

 estimates.

 

·    Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.

 

·    Trade receivables

 

Trade receivables primarily consist of invoiced amounts from Chemrex’s revenue. Chemrex applies interest charges to outstanding balances for certain receivables that exceed certain periods

 

Expected credit losses

 

The Company estimates and records a provision for its expected credit losses related to its financial instruments, including its trade receivables. Management considers historical collection rates, the current financial status of the Company’s customers, macroeconomic factors, and other industry-specific factors when evaluating current expected credit losses. Forward-looking information is also considered in the evaluation of current expected credit losses.

 

To determine the provision for credit losses for accounts receivable, the Company has disaggregated its accounts receivable by  business component, as management determined that risk profile of the Company’s customers is consistent based on the type and industry in which they operate. Each business component is analyzed for estimated credit losses individually. In doing so, the Company establishes a historical loss matrix, based on the previous collections of accounts receivable by the age of such receivables. Further, the Company considers macroeconomic factors and the status of the industry the business component is in to estimate if there are current expected credit losses within its trade receivables based on the trends of the Company’s expectation of the future status of such economic and industry-specific factors. Also, specific allowance amounts are established based on review of outstanding invoices to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. 

 

·    Inventories

 

Inventories consisting of products available for sell are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated net realizable value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks, and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

·    Leases

 

Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest (“discount rate”) in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is based on reference of a borrowing rate from the country where the operating subsidiary is located. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. 

 

·    Property, plant and equipment

 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the cost over the following expected useful lives of the assets concerned.

 

The principal annual rates used are as follows:

Leasehold lands are depreciated over the period of the lease term. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment under construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use

 

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures which substantially increase the useful lives of the related assets are capitalized. When properties are disposed, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported in the period the transaction takes place.

 

Fully depreciated plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

 

 

                                                                   10

·    Impairment of long-lived assets

 

Long-lived assets primarily include goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant, sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented.

 

·    Revenue recognition

 

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

 

The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:

 

·    identify the contract with a customer;

·    identify the performance obligations in the contract;

·    determine the transaction price;

·    allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and

·    recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.

 

The Company records revenue at point in time which is recognized upon goods delivered or services rendered. 

 

·    Shipping and handling fees

 

Shipping and handling fees, if billed to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping and handling fees associated with inbound and outbound freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling and distribution expenses.

 

 

                                                                   11

·    Comprehensive income

 

ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income” establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.

 

·    Income taxes

 

Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

 

The Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.

 

·    Net earnings or loss per share

 

The Company calculates net earnings or loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 “Earnings per share.” Basic earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing the net earnings or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed similar to basic earnings or loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

 

 

                                                                   12

·    Foreign currencies translation

 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.

 

The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$.

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement,” using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

 

Translation of amounts from MYR into US$1.00 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective period and year:

☐    Fair value of financial instruments

 

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

 

The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a six-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

 

☐    Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

      

☐    Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and

 

☐    Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own

      assumptions

 

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

 

☐    Recent accounting pronouncements

 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

 

 

                                                                   14

NOTE 3 - TRADE RECEIVABLES

 

The Company recognized its trade receivables at their original invoice amounts minus an allowance for expected credit losses using a provisional matrix. Any bad debts are written off as identified,

 

Trade receivables primarily consist of amounts owed by unrelated customers, with credit terms typically ranging from 30 to 120 days.

 

In certain instances, the Company applies interest charges to overdue balance on specific trade receivables. Interlink Techno Sdn. Bhd., a customer of Chemrex has been subject to interest at a rate of 6% per annum from May 2021 to June 2023, subsequently increasing to 8.4% from July 2023 onwards. Similarly, Mawintech Sdn Bhd, another customer of Chemrex has been subject to a 6% per annum interest rate since May 2021.

 

Throughout the financial year, no other interest charges were applied to the trade receivables.

NOTE 10 - STOCK HOLDERS’ EQUITY

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On June 5, 2023, the Company filed an Article of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Wyoming Secretary of State to modify the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split from one-for-ten (10) to one-for-twelve (12) (the “Revised Reverse Stock Split”). Upon effectiveness of the Revised Reverse Stock Split, every twelve (12) outstanding shares of common stock were combined into and automatically became one share of common stock. No fractional shares was issued in connection with the Revised Reverse Stock Split and all such fractional shares or odd lots (less than 100 shares to any record or beneficial holder) issuable in the Revised Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to 100 shares. An aggregate of 1,044,351 shares were issued to applicable shareholders as a result of the round-up. 

 

The Revised Reverse Stock Split was approved and authorized by a majority of the Company’s stockholder on May 8, 2023 and by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 8, 2023.

 

Public Offering & Nasdaq Listing 

 

On July 20, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., as underwriter (the "Underwriter") pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a firm commitment underwritten public offering by the Company (the "Offering") of 1,250,000 shares of common stock, no par value, priced at a public offering price of $4.00 per share.

 

In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter was granted a 45-day option (the "Over-Allotment Option") to purchase up to an additional 187,500 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $4.00 per share. The Underwriter fully exercised the Over-Allotment Option on July 24, 2023.

 

The securities were offered by the Company pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-269753), which was originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 14, 2023, and declared effective by the Commission on July 19, 2023.

 

On July 24, 2023, the Offering closed, and the Company issued and sold 1,437,500 shares of common stock, including 187,500 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. The Offering was priced at $4.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $5.75 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter received an 8% underwriting discount on the public offering price for the shares common stock. The Company will therefore receive net proceeds, before expenses, of $5,290,000 from the sale of the common stocks. In addition, the Company issued to the Underwriter warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 115,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Underwriter's Warrants") at an exercise price of $4.40 per share. The Underwriter's Warrants are exercisable from July 24, 2023 until July 24, 2028.

 

In August, 2023, an aggregate of 759,299 shares of common stock were issued to professional parties or service providers in lieu of cash for services rendered, 125,000 were subsequently cancelled in November, 2023.

 

In August, 2023, an aggregate of 75,000 shares of common stock were issued to three directors in lieu of cash for services rendered in connection with their employment as directors of the Company.

 

From July 20, 2023 to August 4, 2023, an aggregate total of 1,044,351 shares of common stock were issued as part of the round-up exercise to the reverse stock split.

 

 

                                                                   20

BGLC is an emerging molecular lab focused on the application of functional genomics to enable early detection of infectious diseases and cancers. On August 23, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of MRNA Scientific Malaysia, which was incorporated in Malaysia on April 7, 2015. MRNA Scientific Malaysia owns algorithm software, technology, and know-how related to the detection of common diseases through blood analysis which we use in our business. Our non-invasive blood screening tests analyze changes in ribonucleic acid (or RNA) to Coronavirus, Dengue, HIV, HPV and the risk potentiality of cancers diseases. This unique blood genomic biomarker approach is based on the scientific observation that circulating blood reflects, in a detectable way, what is occurring throughout the body currently.

 

The corporate and principal office address of the Company and MRNA Scientific Malaysia is Unit 02, Level 10, Tower B, Avenue 3, The Vertical Business Suite II, Bangsar South, No. 8 Jalan Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia., our lab is located at Lab 353, Chemical Science Centre, University Science Malaysia, George Town, Penang, Malaysia.

The results of operations of our subsidiary, MRNA Scientific-Malaysia , with respect to its RNA screening process have been adversely impacted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic followed by a number of prominent variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Although new variants are an expected part of the evolution of viruses, new variant is more aggressive, highly transmissible, vaccine-resistant, able to cause more severe disease in Malaysia. We believe that most people were reluctant to visit hospitals and clinics in view of the post Covid-19 Omicron and its subvariants for fear of transmission from other patients or medical staff. Since our RNA screening is administered at a diagnostic center, our business has been adversely affected as a result.

 

The results of operations for Chemrex were adversely impacted during fiscal year 2023 and the slow recovery into 2024 as the businesses of Chemrex customers especially manufacturers continue to suffer from the lingering impact of  Covid. Many customers across Malaysia saw their supply chains interrupted, demand for their products and services decline and experienced  shortages in supplies and inputs.

 

Recent Developments.

 

(a) Public Offering and Nasdaq Listing

 

On July 20, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., as underwriter (the “Underwriter”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a firm commitment underwritten public offering by the Company (the “Offering”) of 1,250,000 shares of common stock, no par value, priced at a public offering price of $4.00 per share.

 

In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter was granted a 45-day option (the “Over-Allotment Option”) to purchase up to an additional 187,500 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $4.00 per share. The Underwriter fully exercised the Over-Allotment Option on July 24, 2023.

 

The securities were offered by the Company pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-269753), which was originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 14, 2023, and declared effective by the Commission on July 19, 2023.

 

On July 24, 2023, the Offering closed, and the Company issued and sold 1,437,500 shares of common stock, including 187,500 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. The Offering was priced at $4.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $5.75 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter received an 8% underwriting discount on the public offering price for the shares common stock. The Company will therefore receive net proceeds, before expenses, of $5,290,000 from the sale of the common stocks. In addition, the Company issued to the Underwriter warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 115,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Underwriter’s Warrants”) at an exercise price of $4.40 per share. The Underwriter’s Warrants are exercisable from July 24, 2023 until July 24, 2028.

 

On August 2023, there was an issuance of shares of 759,299 and 75,000 respectively as part of Contractual Agreements relating to the uplisting of our Common Stock onto the NASDAQ stock exchange, subsequently followed by the cancellation of 125,000 shares. Please see Note 10.

 

(b) Reverse stock split

 

On June 5, 2023, the Company filed an Article of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Wyoming Secretary of State to modify the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split from one-for-ten (10) to one-for-twelve (12) (the “Revised Reverse Stock Split”). Upon effectiveness of the Revised Reverse Stock Split, every twelve (12) outstanding shares of common stock were combined into and automatically become one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Revised Reverse Stock Split and all such fractional shares or odd lots (less than 100 shares to any record or beneficial holder) issuable in the Revised Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to 100 shares.

 

The Revised Reverse Stock Split was approved and authorized by a majority of the Company’s stockholder in lieu of a shareholder vote on May 8, 2023 and by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 8, 2023.

 

On July 19, 2023, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced the Revised Reverse Stock Split in conjunction with the aforementioned Nasdaq listing.

 

An total of 1,044,351 round-up shares issued after reversal of stock split exercised. Please refer Note 10.

 

                                                                   25

Pursuant to a Form 8-K filed on April 18, 2024, the Company announced a strategic investment in Ascension Innovation Sdn Bhd (AISB), a privately held Malaysian company. Please refer to that filing for more information on the investment.

 

(d) Notification of granting of an additional 180 days to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by Nasdaq Staff

 

On November 6, 2023, the Company reported that it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) regarding the Company’s failure to comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule (“Rule”) 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. A failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. 

 

Under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company automatically was provided a period of 180 calendar days, until May 6, 2024, to regain compliance. 

 

The Company then applied to NASDAQ to receive an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had working capital of $6,188,903 compared with working capital of $6,415,877 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital as of March 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was due principally to losses incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

 

Our primary uses of cash had been for operations. The main sources of cash were generated from operational revenues, the private placement of our common stock, and the proceeds of our public offering. The following trends could result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term:

 

     ·    Addition of administrative and marketing personnel as the business grows,

     ·    Development of a Company website,

     ·    Increases in advertising and marketing in order to attempt to generate more revenues, and

     ·    The cost of being a public company.

  

The Company believes that cash flow from operations together will be sufficient to sustain its current level of operations for at least the next 12 months of operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act (“Exchange Act”) as of March 31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 

Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     i)   Pertain to the maintenance of records that is in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of the Company’s

           assets;

 

     ii)  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements

           in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in

           accordance with the authorizations of management and the board of directors;

           and

 

     iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of

           the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

The Company’s management had assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which assessment identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting had improved. A material weakness could create reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in annual or interim financial statements. The management considers its internal control over financial reporting required further improvement.

 

This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
