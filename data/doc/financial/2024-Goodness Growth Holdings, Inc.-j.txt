GOODNESS GROWTH HOLDINGS, INC.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of Business and Summary

Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc. (“Goodness Growth” or the “Company”) (formerly, Vireo Health International, Inc.) was incorporated under the Alberta Business Corporations Act on November 23, 2004. The Company was previously listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) under ticker symbol “VREO”. On June 9, 2021, the Company changed its name to Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc. and its ticker symbol on the CSE to “GDNS.”

Goodness Growth is a cannabis company whose mission is to provide safe access, quality products and value to its customers while supporting its local communities through active participation and restorative justice programs. Goodness Growth operates cannabis cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Maryland, Minnesota, and New York, and formerly in Arizona and New Mexico.

While marijuana and CBD-infused products are legal under the laws of several U.S. states (with vastly differing restrictions), the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act classifies all “marijuana” as a Schedule I drug. Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. Recently some federal officials have attempted to distinguish between medical cannabis use as necessary, but adult-use as “still a violation of federal law.” At the present time, the distinction between “medical marijuana” and “adult-use marijuana” does not exist under U.S. federal law.

​

On January 31, 2022, the Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Verano Holdings Corp. (“Verano”), pursuant to which Verano was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Goodness Growth pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Arrangement”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, holders of Goodness Growth Shares would receive 0.22652 of a subordinate voting share of Verano (each a “Verano Subordinate Voting Share”), subject to adjustment as described below (the “Exchange Ratio”), for each Subordinate Voting Share held, and 22.652 Verano Subordinate Voting Shares for each Multiple Voting Share and Super Voting Share held, immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement.

​

On October 13, 2022, Goodness Growth received a notice of purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Notice”) from Verano. The Notice asserted certain breaches of the Arrangement Agreement, including claims the Company’s public filings and communications with respect to its business and ongoing operations were misleading and that the Company breached its representations to Verano under the Arrangement Agreement. Verano also claimed, as a result of such breaches, it is entitled to payment of the $14,875,000 termination fee and its transaction expenses. Goodness Growth denies all of Verano’s allegations and affirmatively asserts that it has complied with its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement, and with its disclosure obligations under US and Canadian law, in all material respects at all times. The Company believes that Verano has no factual or legal basis to justify or support its purported grounds for termination of the Arrangement Agreement.

​

On October 21, 2022, Goodness Growth commenced an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Verano after Verano repudiated the Arrangement Agreement. The Company is seeking damages, costs and interest, based on Verano's breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance.

​

On November 14, 2022, Verano filed counterclaims against the Company for the termination fee and transaction expenses described above.

​

On July 31, 2023, the Company filed a requisition for adjournment of its application filed July 14, 2023, and set for hearing on July 31, 2023 to compel Verano’s compliance with document production.

​

6





Throughout 2023, the Company served 4 lists of documents, reviewed document production from Verano, and prepared for examinations for discovery.  The Company also prepared materials in anticipation of seeking summary determination of its claim.

​

Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, it is not possible for Goodness Growth to predict the timing or final outcome of the legal proceedings against Verano or to determine the amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded.

​

The termination of the Arrangement Agreement gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Company management is working with the Company’s lenders, counsel, and other applicable parties to implement a plan to effectively mitigate the conditions giving rise to substantial doubt. Elements of this plan may include, but are not limited to, asset sales, debt restructuring, and capital raises. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent on its future profitability and implementation of the aforementioned plan. The Company may not be successful in these efforts.

Net loss per share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing reported net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reported period. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock of the Company during the reporting period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and the number of potential dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of vested share options and the incremental shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes. Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units.

In computing diluted earnings per share, common share equivalents are not considered in periods in which a net loss is reported, as the inclusion of the common share equivalents would be anti-dilutive. The Company recorded a net loss for the three month periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, presented in these financial statements, and as such there is no difference between the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share for these periods.

The anti-dilutive shares outstanding for the three month period ending March 31, 2024, and 2023 were as follows:

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s primary source of revenue is from wholesale of cannabis products to dispensary locations and direct retail sales to eligible customers at the Company-owned dispensaries. Substantially all of the Company’s retail revenue is from the direct sale of cannabis products to adult-use and medical customers.

3. Business Combinations and Dispositions

Assets Held for Sale

​

As of March 31, 2024, the Company identified property and equipment, deposits, and lease assets and liabilities associated with the businesses in New York, Nevada, and Massachusetts with carrying amounts that are expected to be recovered principally through sale or disposal rather than through continuing use. The sale of these assets and liabilities is highly probable, they can be sold in their immediate condition, and the sales are expected to occur within the next twelve months. 

9





As such, these assets and liabilities have been classified as “held for sale.” Management does not believe these divestitures represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results, and as such, none of these divestitures are considered a discontinued operation. The carrying value of these net assets did not exceed fair value less expected cost to sell, and as such, the Company recorded no impairment loss. Assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows:

4. Fair Value Measurements

The Company complies with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis

The Company’s non-financial assets, such as prepayments and other current assets, long lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. No indicators of impairment existed as of March 31, 2024, and therefore no impairment charges were recorded.

The carrying value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature, and the carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt, and convertible debt approximates fair value as they bear a market rate of interest.

​

The carrying value of the Company’s warrants held  utilize Level 3 inputs given there is no market activity for the asset. The inputs used are further described in Note 19.

13. Long-Term Debt

During 2017 the Company signed a promissory note payable in the amount of $1,010,000. The note bears interest at a rate of 15% per annum with interest payments required on a monthly basis. In 2019 the Company’s promissory note payable in the amount of $1,010,000 was modified to increase the amount payable to $1,110,000. The Company repaid the note in full during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

​

On November 19, 2021, the Company signed a promissory note payable in the amount of $2,000,000 in connection with the acquisition of Charm City Medicus, LLC. The note bears an interest rate of 8% per annum with interest payments due 

14





on the last day of each calendar quarter. On November 19, 2023, the Company and lender amended the note. Per the terms of the amendment, the interest rate was modified to 15%, and the Company paid off $1,000,000 of principal.  The remaining principal balance of $1,000,000 is due on November 19, 2024, and the note is secured by 25% of the membership interests in Vireo Health of Charm City, LLC.

​

On March 25, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured delayed draw term loan with an aggregate principal amount of up to $46,000,000 (the “Credit Facility”), and executed a draw of $26,000,000 in principal. The unpaid principal amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of (a) the U.S. prime rate plus 10.375%, payable monthly in cash, and (b) 2.75% per annum paid in kind (“PIK”) interest payable monthly. In connection with the Credit Facility, the Company also pays a monthly credit monitoring fee in the amount of $130,400 which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2024.

​

On November 18, 2021, the Company and lenders amended the Credit Facility to provide for an additional loan of $4,200,000 with a cash interest rate of 15% per annum and PIK interest of 2% per annum and a maturity date of November 29, 2024. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company.

​

On January 31, 2022, Goodness Growth and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (collectively, “Borrowers”), entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Third Amendment”) providing for additional delayed draw term loans of up to $55 million (the “Delayed Draw Loans”). The cash interest rate on the Delayed Draw Loans under the Third Amendment is equal to the U.S. prime rate plus 10.375%, with a minimum required rate of 13.375% per annum, in addition to PIK interest of 2.75% per annum.

​

On March 31, 2023, the Company executed a fifth amendment to its Credit Facility with its senior secured lender, Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC (the "Agent"), an affiliate of Green Ivy Capital, and a group of lenders. The amended credit facility extends the maturity date on its Delayed Draw Loans to April 30, 2024, through the issuance of 15,000,000 Subordinate Voting Shares in lieu of a cash extension fee. These 15,000,000 shares were valued at $1,407,903 using a fair value per share of $0.094 and considered a deferred financing cost. The fair value per share reflects a 22% discount to the market price at the time of issuance to account for the four-month trading lock-up imposed on the shares. The amendment also provides the Company with reduced cash outlays by eliminating required amortization of the loan, and requires the Company to divest certain assets to improve its liquidity position and financial performance. The Company has the potential to extend the maturity date on its Delayed Draw Loans up to January 31, 2026 with the satisfaction of certain financial performance-related conditions.

​

Unless otherwise specified, all deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of March 31, 2024, $201,015 (December 31, 2023 - $1,524,531) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized.

14. Convertible Notes

​

On April 28, 2023, the Company closed on a new convertible debt facility which enables the Company to access up to $10,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”). The convertible facility has a term of three years, with an annual interest rate of 12.0%, comprised of 6.0% cash and 6.0% PIK. The initial tranche's principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding in the amount of $2,000,000, plus all PIK and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to $0.145. For each future tranche advanced, the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding, plus all paid-in-kind interest and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.145 or a 20.0% premium over the 30-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s Subordinate Voting Shares calculated on the day prior to the date on which each tranche is advanced, if permitted by the Canadian Securities Exchange. The lenders also have the right to advance any remaining undrawn funds on the convertible loan facility to the Company at any time. If the notes are not converted, the outstanding principal amount and unpaid PIK interest is due on April 30, 2026.

​

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company closed eight additional tranches of Convertible Notes, which are convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares at a conversion price of $0.145. Total proceeds received from these tranches amounted to $8,000,000.

​

In connection with this financing, the Company issued 6,250,000 warrants to purchase Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company to the lenders. These warrants have a five year term, a strike price of $0.145, and were valued at $497,055. The value of these warrants and other legal and administrative expenses amounting to $1,346,793 are treated as deferred financing costs. All deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of  March 31, 2024 $967,587 (December 31, 2023 - $1,083,697) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized.

Stock Options

In January 2019, the Company adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan under which the Company may grant incentive stock option, restricted shares, restricted share units, or other awards. Under the terms of the plan, a total of ten percent of the number of shares outstanding assuming conversion of all super voting shares and multiple voting shares to subordinate voting shares are permitted to be issued.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, $0 in stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with outstanding warrants. 

​

Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

​

The expense associated with RSUs is based on the closing share price of the Company’s subordinate voting shares on the business day immediately preceding the grant date, adjusted for the absence of future dividends and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods during which the restrictions lapse. The Company currently has RSUs that vest over a three year period. The awards are generally subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $93,057 and $276,336, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. 

​

​

A summary of RSUs is as follows:

17. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal proceedings

Schneyer

​

On February 25, 2019, Dr. Mark Schneyer (“Schneyer”) filed a lawsuit in Minnesota District Court, Fourth District (the “Court”), on his own behalf and, derivatively, on behalf of Dorchester Capital, LLC, naming Vireo Health, Inc. (“Vireo U.S.”), Dorchester Management, LLC (“Dorchester Management”), and Dorchester Capital, LLC (“Capital”), as defendants. The essence of the claims made by Schneyer is Vireo U.S. paid an inadequate price for MaryMed, LLC (“MaryMed”), which it purchased it from Capital in 2018, and that the consideration given – shares of preferred stock in Vireo U.S. – was distributed inappropriately by Capital at the direction of Dorchester Management (the managing member of Capital). Schneyer, who is a Class B member of Capital, sought unspecified damages in excess of $50,000 and other relief. Dorchester Management, LLC is an affiliated entity to Vireo U.S. and was previously used as a management company over Dorchester Capital, LLC. It no longer has active operations following Vireo Health, Inc.’s acquisition of MaryMed, LLC in 2018. It is owned and controlled by Kyle E. Kingsley and Amber H. Shimpa, executive officers and directors of Vireo U.S. and the Company.

​

19





While Vireo U.S. continues to believe that Schneyer’s claims lack merit, it agreed to settle the litigation in April 2023 to avoid the expense, distraction and risk of the pre-trial and trial processes. Entering into this settlement in no way changed the defendants’ position that they did nothing wrong and that the claims were baseless.

​

Verano

On January 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Arrangement Agreement with Verano, pursuant to which Verano was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Goodness Growth pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, holders of Goodness Growth Shares would receive 0.22652 of a Verano Subordinate Voting Share, subject to adjustment as described below, for each Subordinate Voting Share held, and 22.652 Verano Subordinate Voting Shares for each Multiple Voting Share and Super Voting Share held, immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement.

 

On October 13, 2022, Goodness Growth received a notice of purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Notice”) from Verano. The Notice asserted certain breaches of the Arrangement Agreement, including claims the Company’s public filings and communications with respect to its business and ongoing operations were misleading and that the Company breached its representations to Verano under the Arrangement Agreement. Verano also claimed, as a result of such breaches, it is entitled to payment of a $14,875,000 termination fee and its transaction expenses. Goodness Growth denies all of Verano’s allegations and affirmatively asserts that it has complied with its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement, and with its disclosure obligations under US and Canadian law, in all material respects at all times. The Company believes that Verano has no factual or legal basis to justify or support its purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement, which the Company determined to treat as a repudiation of the Arrangement Agreement.

 

On October 21, 2022, Goodness Growth commenced an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Verano after Verano wrongfully repudiated the Arrangement Agreement. The Company is seeking damages, costs and interest, based on Verano's breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance.

 

On November 14, 2022, Verano filed counterclaims against the Company for the termination fee and transaction expenses described above.

 

On July 31, 2023, the Company filed a requisition for adjournment of its application filed July 14, 2023, and set for hearing on July 31, 2023 to compel Verano’s compliance with document production based upon the Company’s belief that Verano was engaging in tactics to delay the litigation. 

 

Throughout 2023, the Company served 4 lists of documents, reviewed document production from Verano, and prepared for examinations for discovery.  The Company also prepared materials in anticipation of seeking summary determination of its claim, which it anticipates filing within 30 days.

 

Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, it is not possible for Goodness Growth to predict the timing or final outcome of the legal proceedings against Verano or to determine the amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded.  The damages sought will be significant and material given that Verano’s breach left the Company in a vulnerable position resulting in the Company being constrained in its ability to fund growth initiatives that were desirable and that its competitors were able to undertake, most notably in Minnesota and New York markets.

​

Lease commitments

The Company leases various facilities, under non-cancelable finance and operating leases, which expire at various dates through September 2041.

21. Financial Instruments

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with counterparty’s inability to fulfill its payment obligations. The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to cash, accounts receivable, and notes receivable. A small portion of cash is held on hand, from which management believes the risk of loss is remote. Receivables relate primarily to wholesale sales. The Company does not have significant credit risk with respect to customers. The Company’s maximum credit risk exposure is equivalent to the carrying value of these instruments. The Company has been granted licenses pursuant to the laws of the states of Maryland, Minnesota, and New York with respect to cultivating, processing, and/or distributing marijuana. Presently, this industry is illegal under United States federal law. The Company has adhered, and intends to continue to adhere, strictly to the applicable state statutes in its operations.

Liquidity risk

The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s financial liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, debt, 

21





and convertible debt. The Company manages liquidity risk by reviewing its capital requirements on an ongoing basis. Historically, the Company’s main source of funding has been additional funding from investors and debt issuances. The Company’s access to financing is always uncertain. There can be no assurance of continued access to significant equity or debt financing.

Legal Risk

Goodness Growth operates in the United States. The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug. Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the U.S., and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication. In the U.S. marijuana is largely regulated at the state level. State laws regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal.

Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency rates. Given the Company’s financial transactions are rarely denominated in a foreign currency, there is minimal foreign currency risk exposure.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company currently carries variable interest-bearing debt subject to fluctuations in the United States Prime rate. A change of 100 basis points in interest rates during the three months ended March 31, 2024, would have resulted in a corresponding change in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss of $138,570. 

​

​

22. Related Party Transactions

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were $0 and $121,846 due to related parties, respectively.

​

23. Subsequent Events

On April 1, 2024, the Company executed a eighth amendment to its lease with its landlord on its cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facilities located in Johnstown, New York. As part of the eighth amendment to the lease in Johnstown, the Company extended its option to terminate the lease. Written notice of termination now needs to be provided by June 15, 2024. Additionally, the Company has a purchase option to buy the premises for $81,000,000. The purchase option extends through March 27, 2026, and the purchase price increases 3% every six months.

On April 1, 2024, ACE Ventures, LLC (“Ace”), a minority-owned business partnership in the State of New York, and the Company executed a binding term sheet whereby Ace plans to acquire the Company’s subsidiary, Vireo Health of New York (“VireoNY”), pending the satisfaction of closing conditions, including secured capital commitments and regulatory approval. Terms of the transaction include a purchase price between $3.0 and $5.0 million for Vireo Health of New York’s licenses, inventory and assets, as well as either Ace’s assumption of the lease agreement with Innovative Industrial Properties (“IIP”) for the Johnstown, NY cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus or Ace’s acquisition of this campus. Ace has agreed to take financial responsibility for VireoNY’s operations, including its operating losses, beginning on April 1, 2024. These activities are expected to be supported initially by a $2.5 million unsecured loan from the Company to VireoNY.

22





On May 1, 2024, The Company announced that Josh Rosen, who has served as Interim CEO since February of 2023, has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Rosen, retains his Interim Chief Financial Officer title.

On May 1, 2024, The Company announced that it is in ongoing discussions with its senior secured lender, Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC, an affiliate of Green Ivy Capital, to finalize a longer-term extension of its credit agreement. While this process remains ongoing, the parties have agreed to a short-term extension of the maturity date on their term loan until June 14, 2024, matching all other terms of the existing agreement.

​

On May 2, 2024, the Company announced that it has filed an application with the Supreme Court of British Columbia for summary determination in its ongoing litigation with Verano Holdings, Inc. (“Verano”) related to Verano’s wrongful termination of the share exchange agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) between the parties pursuant to which Verano agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company in a transaction announced on February 1, 2022. The Company is seeking substantial damages, specifically US $869.0 million, as well as other costs and legal fees, based on Verano’s breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance. While the Company’s filing of its application for summary determination reflects its belief that Verano’s defense against its claims of unlawful conduct is without merit, the Company can make no assurances regarding the expected timeframe to resolve this litigation, or its ability to recover damages from Verano.

Overview of the Company

Goodness Growth is a cannabis company whose mission is to provide safe access, quality products and value to its customers while supporting its local communities through active participation and restorative justice programs. The Company is evolving with the industry and is in the midst of a transformation to being significantly more customer-centric across its operations, which include cultivation, manufacturing, wholesale and retail business lines. With our core operations strategically located in three limited-license markets through our state-licensed subsidiaries, we cultivate and manufacture cannabis products and distribute these products through our growing network of Green Goods® and other retail dispensaries we own or operate as well as to third-party dispensaries in the markets in which our subsidiaries hold operating licenses.

​

The termination of the Arrangement Agreement with Verano (as more fully described in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies – of our notes to our consolidated financial statement contained herein) gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Company management is working with the Company’s lenders, counsel, and other applicable parties to implement a plan to effectively mitigate the conditions giving rise to substantial doubt. Elements of this plan may include, but are not limited to, asset sales, debt restructuring, and capital raises. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company’s continuance as going concern is dependent on its future profitability and implementation of the aforementioned plan. The Company may not be successful in these efforts.

Three months ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Three months ended March 31, 2023

Revenue

We derived our revenue from cultivating, processing, and distributing cannabis products through our eighteen dispensaries in four states and our wholesale sales to third parties in two states. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, 81% of our revenue was generated from retail dispensaries and 19% from the wholesale business. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, 86% of our revenue was generated from retail business and 14% from wholesale business.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Minnesota operations contributed approximately 46% of revenues, New York contributed 12%, and Maryland contributed 42%. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Minnesota operations contributed approximately 56% of revenues, New York contributed 18%, New Mexico contributed 6%, and Maryland contributed 20%.

Revenue for the three-months ended March 31, 2024, was $24,087,315, an increase of $4,998,892 or 26% compared to revenue of $19,088,423 for the three-months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue contributions from the Maryland business driven by the commencement of adult-use sales on July 1, 2023, partially offset by the decrease in New Mexico revenues, which was divested in June of 2023.

Retail revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $19,599,440 an increase of $3,127,641 or 19% compared to retail revenue of $16,471,799 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to increased revenue contributions from the Maryland business driven by the commencement of adult-use sales on July 1, 2023, partially offset by the decrease in New Mexico revenues, which was divested in June of 2023.

Wholesale revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $4,487,875, an increase of $1,871,251 compared to wholesale revenue of $2,616,624 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit

Gross profit reflects total net revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold represents the costs attributable to producing bulk materials and finished goods, which includes direct materials, labor, and certain indirect costs such as 

25





depreciation, insurance and utilities. Cannabis costs are affected by various state regulations that limit the sourcing and procurement of cannabis product, which may create fluctuations in gross profit over comparative periods as the regulatory environment changes.

Cost of goods sold are determined from costs related to the cultivation and processing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products as well as the cost of finished goods inventory purchased from third parties.

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $11,842,888, an increase of $2,274,677 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, of $9,568,211.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $12,244,427, representing a gross margin of 51%. This is compared to gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023, of $9,520,212 or a 50% gross margin. The increase was primarily attributable to increased profit and margin contributions in Maryland driven by the commencement of Maryland adult-use sales on July 1, 2023. 

We believe our current production capacity has not been fully realized and we expect future gross profits to increase with revenue growth reflective of higher demand, increased product output and new product development. However, we expect gradual price compression as markets mature, which could place downward pressure on our retail and wholesale gross margins.

Total Expenses

Total expenses other than the cost of goods sold consist of selling costs to support customer relationships, marketing, and branding activities. It also includes a significant investment in the corporate infrastructure required to support ongoing business.

Selling costs generally correlate to revenue. In the short-term as a percentage of sales, we expect selling costs to remain relatively flat.  However, as positive regulatory developments in our core markets occur, we expect selling costs as a percentage of sales to decrease via growth in our retail and wholesale channels.

General and administrative expenses also include costs incurred at the corporate offices, primarily related to personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and other professional service costs, as well as corporate insurance, legal and professional fees associated with being a publicly traded company. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease as we realize revenue growth organically and through positive regulatory developments in our core markets.

Total expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $7,484,983 a decrease of $1,666,723 compared to total expenses of $9,151,706 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in total expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and wages and stock-based compensation expense.

Operating Income before Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes

Operating income before other income (expense) and provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $4,759,444 an increase of $4,390,938 compared to operating income of $368,506 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Total Other Expense

Total other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $7,525,904, an increase of $413,428 compared to other expense of $7,112,476 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This change is primarily attributable to an increased interest expenses partially offset by the gain on warrants held of $1,327,879.

26





Provision for Income Taxes

Income tax expense is recognized based on the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at year-end. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, tax expense totaled $3,945,000 compared to tax expense of $1,662,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

​

NON-GAAP MEASURES

EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized definition under the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Total Revenues excluding revenues from states where we have divested operations is also a non-GAAP measure that does not have a standardized definition under GAAP. The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measure Total Revenues that excludes revenues from states where we have divested operations presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables above where the measure appears. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business.

Liquidity, Financing Activities During the Period, and Capital Resources

We are an early-stage growth company. We are generating cash from sales and deploying our capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and near term. Capital reserves are for capital expenditures and improvements in existing facilities, product development and marketing, customer, supplier, investor, industry relations, and working capital.

Current management forecasts and related assumptions support the view that we can adequately manage the operational needs of the business.

Credit Facility

During 2017 the Company signed a promissory note payable in the amount of $1,010,000. The note bears interest at a rate of 15% per annum with interest payments required on a monthly basis. In 2019 the Company’s promissory note payable in the amount of $1,010,000 was modified to increase the amount payable to $1,110,000. The Company repaid the note in full during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

​

On November 19, 2021, the Company signed a promissory note payable in the amount of $2,000,000 in connection with the acquisition of Charm City Medicus, LLC. The note bears an interest rate of 8% per annum with interest payments due on the last day of each calendar quarter. On November 19, 2023, the Company and lender amended the note. Per the terms 

27





of the amendment, the interest rate was modified to 15%, and the Company paid off $1,000,000 of principal.  The remaining principal balance of $1,000,000 is due on November 19, 2024, and the note is secured by 25% of the membership interests in Vireo Health of Charm City, LLC.

​

On March 25, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured delayed draw term loan with an aggregate principal amount of up to $46,000,000 (the “Credit Facility”), and executed a draw of $26,000,000 in principal. The unpaid principal amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of (a) the U.S. prime rate plus 10.375%, payable monthly in cash, and (b) 2.75% per annum paid in kind (“PIK”) interest payable monthly. In connection with the Credit Facility, the Company also pays a monthly credit monitoring fee in the amount of $130,400 which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2024.

​

On November 18, 2021, the Company and lenders amended the Credit Facility to provide for an additional loan of $4,200,000 with a cash interest rate of 15% per annum and PIK interest of 2% per annum and a maturity date of November 29, 2024. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company.

​

On January 31, 2022, Goodness Growth and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (collectively, “Borrowers”), entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Third Amendment”) providing for additional delayed draw term loans of up to $55 million (the “Delayed Draw Loans”). The cash interest rate on the Delayed Draw Loans under the Third Amendment is equal to the U.S. prime rate plus 10.375%, with a minimum required rate of 13.375% per annum, in addition to PIK interest of 2.75% per annum.

​

On March 31, 2023, the Company executed a fifth amendment to its Credit Facility with its senior secured lender, Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC (the "Agent"), an affiliate of Green Ivy Capital, and a group of lenders. The amended credit facility extends the maturity date on its Delayed Draw Loans to April 30, 2024, through the issuance of 15,000,000 Subordinate Voting Shares in lieu of a cash extension fee. These 15,000,000 shares were valued at $1,407,903 using a fair value per share of $0.094 and considered a deferred financing cost. The fair value per share reflects a 22% discount to the market price at the time of issuance to account for the four-month trading lock-up imposed on the shares. The amendment also provides the Company with reduced cash outlays by eliminating required amortization of the loan, and requires the Company to divest certain assets to improve its liquidity position and financial performance. The Company has the potential to extend the maturity date on its Delayed Draw Loans up to January 31, 2026 with the satisfaction of certain financial performance-related conditions.

​

Unless otherwise specified, all deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of March 31, 2024, $201,015 (December 31, 2023 - $1,524,531) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized.

​

Convertible Notes

​

On April 28, 2023, the Company closed on a new convertible debt facility which enables the Company to access up to $10,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”). The convertible facility has a term of three years, with an annual interest rate of 12.0%, comprised of 6.0% cash and 6.0% PIK. The initial tranche's principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding in the amount of $2,000,000, plus all PIK and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to $0.145. For each future tranche advanced, the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding, plus all paid-in-kind interest and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.145 or a 20.0% premium over the 30-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s Subordinate Voting Shares calculated on the day prior to the date on which each tranche is advanced, if permitted by the Canadian Securities Exchange. The lenders also have the right to advance any remaining undrawn funds on the convertible loan facility to the Company at any time. If the notes are not converted, the outstanding principal amount and unpaid PIK interest is due on April 30, 2026.

​

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company closed eight additional tranches of Convertible Notes, which are convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares at a conversion price of $0.145. Total proceeds received from these tranches amounted to $8,000,000.

​

In connection with this financing, the Company issued 6,250,000 warrants to purchase Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company to the lenders. These warrants have a five year term, a strike price of $0.145, and were valued at $497,055. The value of these warrants and other legal and administrative expenses amounting to $1,346,793 are treated as deferred financing costs. All deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of  March 31, 2024 $967,587 (December 31, 2023 - $1,083,697) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized.

​

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million as compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to increased gross profit.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased property, plant, and equipment additions relative to the prior year quarter.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a change of $0.8 million as compared to $0.3 million used in financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The change was principally due to repayment of a $1.0 million promissory note during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Lease Transactions

As of March 31, 2024, we have entered into lease agreements for the use of buildings used in cultivation, production and/or sales of cannabis products in Maryland, Minnesota, and New York.

​

The lease agreements for all of the retail space used for our dispensary operations are with third-party landlords and remaining duration ranges from 1 to 6 years. These agreements are short-term facility leases that require us to make monthly rent payments as well as funding common area costs, utilities and maintenance. In some cases, we have received tenant improvement funds to assist in the buildout of the space to meet our operating needs. As of March 31, 2024, we operated 14 retail locations secured under these agreements.

We have also entered into sale and leaseback arrangements for our cultivation and processing facilities in Minnesota and New York with a special-purpose real estate investment trust. These leases are long-term agreements that provide, among other things, funds to make certain improvements to the property that will significantly enhance production capacity and operational efficiency of the facility.

Excluding any contracts under one year in duration, the future minimum lease payments (principal and interest) on all our leases are as follows:
