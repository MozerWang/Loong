AIM IMMUNOTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1: Business and Basis of Presentation

 

AIM ImmunoTech Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “AIM”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) are an immuno-pharma company headquartered in Ocala, Florida, and focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat multiple types of cancers, viral diseases and immune-deficiency disorders. We have established a strong foundation of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids and natural interferon to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body, and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain cancers and chronic diseases.

 

AIM’s flagship products are Ampligen (rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and Alferon N Injection (Interferon alfa). Ampligen has not been approved by the FDA or marketed in the United States. Ampligen is approved for commercial sale in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”).

 

The Company’s primary business focus involves Ampligen. Ampligen is a double-stranded RNA (“dsRNA”) molecule being developed for globally important cancers, viral diseases and disorders of the immune system.

 

The Company is currently proceeding primarily in four areas:

 

               ●    Conducting a randomized, controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Ampligen compared to a control group

                     to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer

                     patients.

               ●    Evaluating Ampligen in other cancers, as a potential therapy that modifies the tumor microenvironment with the

                     goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to checkpoint

                     inhibitors.

               ●    Exploring Ampligen’s antiviral activities and potential use as a prophylactic or treatment for existing viruses,

                     new viruses and mutated viruses

                     thereof.

               ●    Evaluating Ampligen as a treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (“ME/CFS”) and fatigue

                     and/or Post-COVID conditions of

                     fatigue.

 

The Company is prioritizing activities in an order related to the stage of development, with those clinical activities such as pancreatic cancer, ME/CFS and Post-COVID conditions having priority over antiviral experimentation. The Company intends that priority clinical work be conducted in trials authorized by the FDA or European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which trials support a potential future NDA. However, AIM’s antiviral experimentation is designed to accumulate additional preliminary data supporting their hypothesis that Ampligen is a powerful, broad-spectrum prophylaxis and early-onset therapeutic that may confer enhanced immunity and cross-protection. Accordingly, AIM will conduct antiviral programs in those venues most readily available and able to generate valid proof-of-concept data, including foreign venues.

 

AIM’s business plan requires one or more Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMO”) to produce Ampligen and its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). This includes utilizing Jubilant HollisterStier and Sterling for the manufacture of Ampligen and our Poly I and Poly C12U polynucleotides, respectively. Additionally, our relationship with Polysciences Inc. (“Polysciences”) continues and R&D development of polymer manufacture is ongoing.

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of its consolidated financial statements have been included. Such adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.

 

The interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are presented as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and do not contain certain information which will be included in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

 

These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 29, 2024.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure (“GAAP”) of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences may be material. Accounts requiring the use of significant estimates include determination of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, valuation of deferred taxes, patent and trademark valuations, equity-based compensation calculations, fair value of warrants, and contingency accruals.

 

                                                                   6

 

 

Note 2: Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash includes bank deposits maintained at several financial institutions. The Company considers highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At various times throughout the three months ended March 31, 2024, some accounts held at financial institutions were in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and believes credit risk to be minimal.

 

Note 3: Marketable Investments

 

Marketable investments consist of mutual funds. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, it was determined that none of the marketable investments had an other-than-temporary impairment. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all securities were measured as Level 1 instruments of the fair value measurements standard (See Note 7: Fair Value). At March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 the Company held $7,647,000 and $7,631,000, respectively, in mutual funds.

Note 6: Leases

 

The Company leases office and lab facilities and other equipment under non-cancellable operating leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 5 years, expiring at various dates during 2024 through 2027, and requiring monthly payments ranging from less than $1,000 to $17,000. Certain leases include additional renewal options ranging from 1 to 5 years. AIM has classified all of its leases as operating leases.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of the right of use assets was $763,000 and $697,000, respectively, and the corresponding operating lease liability balance was $777,000 and $718,000, respectively. Right of use assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $296,000 and $363,000 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

AIM recognized rent expense associated with these leases are follows:

Note 7: Fair Value

 

Fair Value

 

The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements” for its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis.

 

The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. AIM categorizes each of its fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

 

          1.   Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.

                Generally, this includes debt and equity securities that are traded in an active

                market.

          2.   Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted

                prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market

                data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Generally, this includes debt and equity securities

                that are not traded in an active

                market.

          3.   Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair

                value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is

                determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or other valuation techniques, as well as

                instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of

                March 31, 2024, the Company has classified the warrants with cash settlement features as Level 3. Management evaluates

                a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs. As discussed above, the Company utilized the

                Monte Carlo Simulation Model in valuing the

                warrants.

 

The table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the hierarchy as (in thousands):

The Company’s cash balances are representative of their fair values as these balances are comprised of deposits available on demand. For certain instruments, including funds receivable from New Jersey net operating loss, accounts payable and accrued expenses, it was estimated that the carrying values approximated the fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments (Level 1).

 

The Company also had certain redeemable warrants in the Rights Offering with a cash settlement feature in the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction. No Fundamental Transaction occurred. During the first quarter 2024, 205,000 of these Warrants converted on a cashless basis and the balance expired.

Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

 

The Company has designated 10,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). Each share of Preferred Stock has a par value of $0.01 per share and a stated value equal to $1,000 (the “Stated Value”). The shares of Preferred Stock shall initially be issued and maintained in the form of securities held in book-entry form and the Depository Trust Company or its nominee (“DTC”) shall initially be the sole registered holder of the shares of Preferred Stock.

 

Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time and from time to time from and after the Original Issue Date at the option of the Holder thereof or at any time and from time to time on or after the second anniversary of the Original Issue Date at the option of the Corporation, into that number of shares of Common Stock (subject in each case to the limitations determined by dividing the Stated Value of such share of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price). The conversion price for the Preferred Stock shall be equal to $0.20, subject to adjustment herein (the “Conversion Price”).

 

Pursuant to a registration statement relating to a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) declared effective by the SEC on February 14, 2019, AIM distributed to its holders of common stock and to holders of certain options and redeemable warrants as of February 14, 2019, at no charge, one non-transferable subscription right for each share of common stock held or deemed held on the record date. Each right entitled the holder to purchase one unit, at a subscription price of $1,000 per unit, consisting of one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 (and immediately convertible into common stock at an assumed conversion price of $8.80) and 114 warrants with an assumed exercise price of $8.80. The redeemable warrants are exercisable for five years after the date of issuance. The net proceeds realized from the rights offering were approximately $4,700,000.

Each such Preferred Share is convertible into 114 shares of common stock. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Holders shall be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus of the Company the same amount that a holder of Common Stock would receive if the Preferred Stock was fully converted.

The fair value of each option and equity warrant award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing valuation model. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option and equity warrant. The Company uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield, expected life and forfeiture rates. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, there were no options granted.

We do not undertake to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof. We are in various stages of seeking to determine whether Ampligen® will be effective in the treatment of multiple types of viral diseases, cancers, and immune-deficiency disorders and the presentation sets forth our current and anticipated future activities. These activities are subject to change for a number of reasons. Significant additional testing and trials will be required to determine whether Ampligen® will be effective in the treatment of these conditions. Results obtained in animal models do not necessarily predict results in humans. Human clinical trials will be necessary to prove whether or not Ampligen® will be efficacious in humans. No assurance can be given as to whether current or planned clinical trials will be successful or yield favorable data and the trials are subject to many factors including lack of regulatory approval(s), lack of study drug, or a change in priorities at the institutions sponsoring other trials. Even if these clinical trials are initiated, we cannot assure that the clinical studies will be successful or yield any useful data or require additional funding. Among the studies are clinical trials that provide only preliminary data with a small number of subjects, and no assurance can be given that the findings in these studies will prove true or that the study or studies will yield favorable results. Some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions are working on a treatment for COVID-19. Even if Ampligen® proves effective in combating the virus, no assurance can be given that our actions toward proving this will be given first priority or that another treatment that eventually proves capable will not make our efforts ultimately unproductive, as multiple vaccines, and some treatments, are now available and major pharma companies are working to develop their own disease treatments. Some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies are also working on treatments and cures for different types of cancers. No assurance can be given that the use of Ampligen with these proposed treatments and cures will prove effective. No assurance can be given that future studies will not result in findings that are different from those reported in the studies referenced or incorporated by reference herein. Operating in foreign countries carries with it a number of risks, including potential difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights. In addition, many countries, including Argentina, are still dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks and have made that their primary focus. We believe that this may be delaying our commercialization of Ampligen® in Argentina until COVID-19 is more under control. We cannot assure that our potential foreign operations will not be adversely affected by these risks.

Overview

General

 

AIM ImmunoTech Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “AIM”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) are an immuno-pharma company headquartered in Ocala, Florida, and focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat multiple types of cancers, viral diseases and immune-deficiency disorders. We have established a strong foundation of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids and natural interferon to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body, and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain cancers and chronic diseases.

 

Our flagship products are Ampligen (rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and Alferon N Injection (Interferon alfa). Ampligen has not been approved by the FDA or marketed in the United States. Ampligen is approved for commercial sale in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”).

 

Our primary business focus involves Ampligen. Ampligen is a double-stranded RNA (“dsRNA”) molecule being developed for globally important cancers, viral diseases and disorders of the immune system.

 

                                                                   18

 

 

We are currently proceeding primarily in four areas:

 

               ●    Conducting a randomized, controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Ampligen compared to a control group

                     to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer

                     patients.

               ●    Evaluating Ampligen in other cancers, as a potential therapy that modifies the tumor microenvironment with the

                     goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to checkpoint

                     inhibitors.

               ●    Exploring Ampligen’s antiviral activities and potential use as a prophylactic or treatment for existing viruses,

                     new viruses and mutated viruses

                     thereof.

               ●    Evaluating Ampligen as a treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (“ME/CFS”) and fatigue

                     and/or Post-COVID conditions of

                     fatigue.

 

We are prioritizing activities in an order related to the stage of development, with those clinical activities such as pancreatic cancer, ME/CFS and Post-COVID conditions having priority over antiviral experimentation. We intend that priority clinical work be conducted in trials authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which trials support a potential future NDA. However, our antiviral experimentation is designed to accumulate additional preliminary data supporting their hypothesis that Ampligen is a powerful, broad-spectrum prophylaxis and early-onset therapeutic that may confer enhanced immunity and cross-protection. Accordingly, we will conduct antiviral programs in those venues most readily available and able to generate valid proof-of-concept data, including foreign venues.

Immuno-Oncology.

 

We are focused on pancreatic cancer because testing results, to date, primarily conducted in the Netherlands, have been very promising. The Netherlands study generated statistically significant data indicating that Ampligen extended survival well beyond the Standard of Care (“SOC”), when compared to well-matched historical controls. These data support the proposition that Ampligen, when administered to either patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer after systemic chemotherapy showed a statistically significant increase in survival rate. In October 2021, we and our Contract Research Organization, Amarex, submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA for a planned Phase 2 study of Ampligen as a therapy for locally advanced or metastatic late-stage pancreatic cancer.

 

Because of the differences in the scale of necessary trials, our initial primary focus when it comes to pancreatic cancer will be cases that are locally advanced, rather than metastatic. The number of different approaches to treating metastatic pancreatic cancer — approaches which would be determined by treating physicians — would require a much larger, far more expensive trial than would a trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we are focusing on patients who have completed FOLFIRINOX and have stable disease. In August 2022, we received Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval of the trial protocol in locally advanced pancreatic cancer and so announced the trial’s commencement. The study is recruiting patients. Assuming this trial and subsequent planned clinical trials confirm the existing data, our goal is to then submit an NDA for use of Ampligen in pancreatic cancer patients.

 

Ampligen has also demonstrated in the clinic the potential for standalone efficacy in a number of other solid tumors. We have also seen success in increasing survival rates and efficacy in the treatment of animal tumors when Ampligen is used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies. In fact, in March 2022 we announced interim data from an investigator-initiated, Phase 2, single-arm, efficacy/safety trial to evaluate the effectiveness of combining intensive locoregional intraperitoneal (IP) chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP Ampligen (TLR-3 agonist) and IV infusion of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. We believe that data from the study, which is being conducted by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and funded by a Merck grant, demonstrated that when combining three drugs – Ampligen and pembrolizumab, which are both immune therapies, with cisplatin, a chemotherapy – evidence of increased biomarkers associated with T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function has been seen. Importantly, increases of these biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment have been correlated with favorable tumor responses. These successes in the field of immuno-oncology have guided our efforts toward the potential use of Ampligen as a combinational therapy for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types. The first of our patent applications in this space was granted by the Netherlands on March 15, 2021.

Ampligen as a Potential Antiviral

 

We have a research and pre-clinical history that indicates broad-spectrum antiviral capability of Ampligen in animals. We hope to demonstrate that it has the same effect in humans. To do this, among other things, we need a population infected with a virus. That is why we have spent significant resources on COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) which is active and still infecting many subjects. While much would need to be done to get Ampligen to market as a broad-spectrum antiviral, we believe that it is important to focus our efforts first and foremost on thoroughly proving the concept, especially while there is still a large COVID-19-infected population. Previously, animal studies were conducted that yielded positive results utilizing Ampligen to treat numerous viruses, such as Western Equine Encephalitis Virus, Ebola, Vaccinia Virus (which is used in the manufacture of smallpox vaccine) and SARS-CoV-1. We have conducted experiments in SARS-CoV-2 showing Ampligen has a powerful impact on viral replication. The prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against SARS-CoV-2.

 

                                                                   19

 

 

The FDA has requested that we provide additional data to assist the agency in evaluating the potential risks and benefits of administering Ampligen to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 individuals. However, as discussed in more detail below, where the threat to the patient from COVID-19 is high, the FDA has already authorized Ampligen in a clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 who have a pre-existing cancer. We have also elected to explore studies (initially with healthy volunteers) outside the United States and have already conducted a study in the Netherlands to determine the safety profile of the intranasal delivery of Ampligen.

 

In this regard, CHDR, a foundation located in Leiden in the Netherlands, managed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind study for us to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biological activity of repeated administration of Ampligen intranasally. A total of 40 healthy subjects received either Ampligen or a placebo in the trial, with the Ampligen given at four escalating dosages across four cohorts, to a maximum level of 1,250 micrograms. The study was completed, and the Final Safety Report reported no Serious or Severe Adverse Events at any dosage level.

 

While there are approved therapies for COVID-19, we believe that, if Ampligen has the broad-spectrum antiviral properties that we believe that it has, it could be a very valuable tool in treating variants of existing viral diseases, including COVID-19, or novel ones that arise in the future. Unlike most developing therapeutics which attack the virus, Ampligen works differently. We believe that it activates antiviral immune system pathways that fight not just a particular virus or viral variant, but other similar viruses as well.

 

Please see “Ampligen as a Potential Antiviral” below.

 

Ampligen as a Treatment for Post-COVID Conditions

 

In July 2023, we enrolled and dosed the first patient in our Phase 2 study evaluating Ampligen® as a potential therapeutic for people with post-COVID conditions (“AMP-518”). We announced in August 2023 that the study had met the planned enrollment of 80 subjects ages 18 to 60 years who have been randomized 1:1 to receive twice-weekly intravenous infusions of Ampligen or placebo for 12 weeks, with a follow-up phase of two weeks. All patients have completed the study and topline data was reported in February 2024.

 

Please see “Ampligen as a Treatment for Post-COVID Conditions” below.

 

Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS and Post-COVID Conditions

 

We have long been focused on seeking the FDA’s approval for the use of Ampligen to treat myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (“ME/CFS”). In fact, in February 2013, we received a Complete Response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for our Ampligen NDA for ME/CFS, stating that we should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses.

 

While developing a comprehensive response to the FDA and a plan for a confirmatory trial for the FDA NDA, we proceeded independently in Argentina and, in August 2016, we received approval of an NDA from ANMAT for commercial sale of Ampligen in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. On June 10, 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. The next steps in the commercial launch of Ampligen include ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. This testing and approval process is ongoing due to ANMAT’s internal processes. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, GP Pharm will be responsible for distributing Ampligen in Argentina.

 

The FDA authorized an open-label treatment protocol (“AMP-511”) allowing patient access to Ampligen for treatment in a study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen to treat this very serious and chronic condition. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through a consortium group of clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen in patients with CFS. The AMP-511 protocol is ongoing. In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 protocol to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms that we refer to as Post-COVID conditions. As of March 31, 2024, there were 10 patients enrolled in this open-label, expanded access treatment protocol (including three patients with Post-COVID Conditions). To date, there have been eight such Post-COVID patients treated in the study. AIM previously reported positive preliminary results based on data from the first four Post-COVID Condition patients enrolled in the study. The data show that, by week 12, compared to baseline, there was what the investigators considered a clinically significant decrease in fatigue-related measures.

 

                                                                   20

 

 

We plan on a comprehensive follow through with the FDA regarding the use of Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS. We have learned a great deal since the FDA’s CRL and plan to adjust our approach to concentrate on specific ME/CFS symptoms. Responses to the CRL and a proposed confirmatory trial are being worked on now by our R&D team and consultants.

Atlas Equity Line of Credit

 

On March 28, 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Atlas Sciences, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Atlas”), pursuant to which Atlas has committed to purchase up to $15 million of our Common Stock.

 

Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Atlas, and Atlas is obligated to purchase up to $15 million of our Common Stock (the “Commitment Amount”). Such sales by us, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement covering the resale of shares that have been and may be issued under the Purchase Agreement. We agreed to file the registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Sales cannot commence until the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith is filed and the other conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied.

 

Atlas has no right to require us to sell any shares to Atlas, but Atlas is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions. There are no upper limits on the price per share that Atlas must pay for shares of Common Stock. Actual sales of shares to Atlas will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations.

 

The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares to Atlas. We expect that any proceeds received by us will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

 

We cannot sell shares below the Minimum Price (as defined by the NYSE American) under the Purchase Agreement that would represent, in the aggregate, more than 19.99% of the outstanding shares on the date that the Purchase Agreement was executed. Before we could do that, we would need to obtain stockholder approval.

 

We have agreed with Atlas that we will not enter into any “variable rate” transactions with any third party for a period defined in the Purchase Agreement. Atlas has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.

 

As consideration for Atlas’s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to pay Atlas an initial commitment fee in shares equal to 1.0% of the Commitment Amount. The initial commitment fee was paid upon execution of the Purchase Agreement through the issuance of 338,600 shares of Common Stock.

 

The Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty.

 

During any period where bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, for relief under any bankruptcy law or any law for the relief of debtors shall be instituted or anticipated by or against us or any of our subsidiaries, and in the case of such a proceeding being involuntary or commenced against us, which is not dismissed within 60 days, we may not initiate any purchase of shares by Atlas.

 

The representations, warranties and covenants contained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. The foregoing descriptions of the Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of these Agreements which were filed as exhibits 10.104 and 10.105 to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

                                                                   21

 

 

OUR PRODUCTS

 

Our primary pharmaceutical product platform consists of Ampligen (rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular double-stranded (ds) RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and our FDA-approved natural alpha-interferon product, Alferon N Injection.

 

Ampligen®

 

Ampligen is approved for sale in Argentina (to 2026) for severe CFS and is an experimental drug in the United States currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of certain cancers and ME/CFS. Over its developmental history, Ampligen has received various designations, including Orphan Drug Product Designation (FDA and EMA), Treatment protocol (e.g., “Expanded Access” or “Compassionate” use authorization) with Cost Recovery Authorization (FDA) and “promising” clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports (“AHRQ” or Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Based on the results of published, peer-reviewed pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that Ampligen may have broad-spectrum antiviral and anti-cancer properties.

 

We believe that nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of many human diseases. Ampligen represents the first drug in the class of large (macromolecular) dsRNA molecules to apply for NDA review. There are two forms of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) and ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). DNA is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes, the cell’s genetic machinery. RNA is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell’s behavior which, in turn, regulates the action of groups of cells, including the cells which comprise the body’s immune system. RNA directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors. Our drug technology utilizes specifically configured RNA and is a selective Toll-like Receptor 3 (“TLR3”) agonist that can be administered intravenously, intranasally and intraperitoneally. Ampligen has been assigned the generic name rintatolimod by the United States Adopted Names Council (“USANC”) and has the chemical designation poly(I):poly(C12U).

 

Expanded Access Program/Early Access Programs/clinical trials of Ampligen that have been conducted or that are ongoing include studies of the potential treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, ME/CFS, Hepatitis B, HIV, COVID-19 and Post-COVID conditions.

 

We have received approval of our NDA from ANMAT for the commercial sale of Ampligen in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. The product will be marketed by GP Pharm, our commercial partner in Latin America. Shipment of the drug product to Argentina was initiated in 2018 to complete the release testing by ANMAT needed for commercial distribution. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. In June 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. We are currently working with GP Pharm on the commercial launch of Ampligen in Argentina. Commercialization in Argentina will require, among other things, GP Pharm to establish disease awareness, medical education, creation of an appropriate reimbursement level, design of marketing strategies and completion of manufacturing preparations for launch and ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. AIM has supplied GP Pharm with the Ampligen required for testing and ANMAT release. This testing and approval process is ongoing due to ANMAT’s internal processes. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina. Argentina has experienced hyper-inflation and recently devalued its currency to the U.S. dollar by 50%. Contracts with GP Pharm are U.S. dollar contracts and the parties must evaluate the impact of the recent devaluation on its relationship.

 

The FDA has authorized an open-label expanded access treatment protocol (AMP-511) allowing patient access to Ampligen in a study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen to treat this serious and chronic condition. The AMP-511 protocol started in the 1990s and is ongoing. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen in patients with CFS. We are establishing an enlarged database of clinical safety information which we believe will provide further documentation regarding the absence of autoimmune disease associated with Ampligen treatment. We believe that continued efforts to understand existing data, and to advance the development of new data and information, will ultimately support our future filings for Ampligen and/or the design of future clinical studies that the FDA requested in a CRL. The FDA approved an increased reimbursement level from $200 to $345 per 200 mg vial of Ampligen, due to increased production costs; which was re-authorized in 2021, 2022 and 2023. At this time, we do not plan on passing this adjustment along to the patients in this program. In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms that we refer to as Post-COVID conditions. As of March 31, 2024, there are 10 patients enrolled in this open-label expanded access treatment protocol. In July 2022, AIM reported positive preliminary results based on data from the first four Post-COVID Condition patients enrolled in the study. The data show that, by week 12, compared to baseline, the investigators observed what they considered a clinically significant decrease in fatigue-related measures. To date, there have been eight such Post-COVID patients treated in this study.

 

                                                                   22

 

 

In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with myTomorrows, a Netherlands based company, for the commencement and management of an Early Access Program (“EAP”) in Europe and Turkey related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, myTomorrows also is managing all Early Access Programs and Special Access Programs in Europe, Canada, and Turkey to treat pancreatic cancer and ME/CFS patients. The agreement was automatically extended for a period of 12 months on May 20, 2021; has been automatically extended for 12 months on each subsequent May 20; and will continue to be automatically extended for periods of 12 months every May 20 until terminated or the terms of the agreement are met.

 

In June 2018, Ampligen was cited as outperforming two other TLR3 agonists — poly IC and natural double stranded RNA — in creating an enhanced tumor microenvironment for checkpoint blockade therapy in the journal of Cancer Research (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/05/31/0008-5472.CAN-17-3985). In a head-to-head study in explant culture models, Ampligen activated the TLR3 pathway and promoted an accumulation of killer T cells but, unlike the other two TLR3 agonists, it did so without causing regulatory T cell (Treg) attraction. These findings were considered important because they indicate that Ampligen selectively reprograms the tumor microenvironment by inducing the beneficial aspects of tumor inflammation (attracting killer T cells), without amplifying immune-suppressive elements such as regulatory T cells. The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and Roswell Park as a part of the NIH-funded P01 CA132714 and Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (“SPORE”).

 

In 2018, we completed production of two commercial-size batches of more than 16,000 vials of Ampligen, following its “Fill & Finish” at Jubilant HollisterStier, the Contract Manufacturing Organization. These lots passed all required testing for regulatory release for human use and are being used for multiple programs, including: the treatment of ME/CFS; the pancreatic cancer EAP in the Netherlands; and will continue to be used for ongoing and future clinical studies in oncology. Additionally, two lots of Ampligen were manufactured in December 2019 and January 2020 at Jubilant HollisterStier and we recently issued a purchase order for a total of $1,432,257 to manufacture additional lots of Ampligen at Jubilant. The current manufactured lots of Ampligen have been fully tested and released for commercial product launch in Argentina and for clinical trials. Additionally, in December 2020, we added Pii as a “Fill & Finish” provider to enhance our capacity to produce Ampligen. This addition amplifies our manufacturing capability by providing redundancy and cost savings. The contracts augment our active and in-process fill and finish capacity.

 

Immuno-Oncology

 

The potential of Ampligen as an immuno-oncology therapeutic has been a major focus of AIM since our current leadership took over in 2016. We have been working with the University of Pittsburgh’s chemokine modulation research initiative, which includes the use of Ampligen as a potential adjuvant to modify the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) with the goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to check point inhibitors (“CPI”). As part of this collaboration, we have supplied Ampligen to the University. The study, under the leadership of Robert P. Edwards, MD, chair of gynecologic services at Magee-Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Professor of Surgery Pawel Kalinski, M.D., Ph.D., at Roswell Park, Buffalo, N.Y., involved the chemokine modulatory regimen developed by Dr. Kalinski’s group and successfully completed the Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with resectable colorectal cancer.

 

Multiple Ampligen clinical trials are underway or recently completed at major university cancer centers testing whether tumor microenvironments can be reprogrammed to increase the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors. The underway trials include:

 

     ●    Pancreatic Cancer Trial - The Phase 2 AMP-270 clinical trial is a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-arm study with

           the primary objective of comparing the efficacy of Ampligen versus a no treatment control group following FOLFIRINOX for

           subjects with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Secondary objectives include comparing safety and tolerability.

           The AMP-270 is expected to enroll approximately 90 subjects in up to 30 centers across the U.S. and Europe. In March 2022,

           the FDA granted clearance to proceed with the study. In April 2022, we executed a work order with Amarex to manage the

           clinical trial. In August 2022, we received IRB approval of the trial protocol and so announced the trial’s commencement.

           The authorization to proceed with the Phase 2 pancreatic cancer clinical trial has been received with potential sites in the

           Netherlands at Erasmus MC, and also at major cancer research centers in the United States such as The Buffett Cancer Center

           at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). The study is recruiting patients.

     ●    Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer

 

               ○    Results of the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 study of intraperitoneal chemo-immunotherapy in advanced recurrent

                     important extension of prior studies using human tumor explants that showed Ampligen’s potentially important role

                     as a TLR3 agonist acting synergistically with high-dose IFNα and celecoxib to selectively enhance Teff

                     cell-attractants while suppressing Treg-attractants in the tumor microenvironment with a concomitant increase in

                     the Teff/Treg ratio. The importance of boosting the Teff/Treg ratio in the tumor microenvironment is that it is

                     associated with the conversion of ‘cold’ tumors into ‘hot’ tumors, which have an increased sensitivity to

                     chemo-immunotherapy and an improved chance of showing tumor regression. The Phase 1 portion was designed to

                     establish intraperitoneal safety. The Phase 2 portion of the study is planned to be conducted in the future.

               ○    A Phase 2 study of advanced recurrent ovarian cancer using cisplatin, pembrolizumab, plus Ampligen; up to 45

                     patients to be enrolled; enrollment has commenced, and numerous patients have commenced treatment. In April 2024,

                     researchers released topline data that saw an Objective Response Rate (“ORR”) of 45% in platinum-sensitive

                     subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. ORR includes complete response (“CR”) and partial response (“PR”) to

                     treatment. There was a total Clinical Benefit Rate (“CBR”) of 55% when including patients who experienced stable

                     disease (“SD”). Researchers also reported a median Progression-Free Survival (“PFS”) of 7.8 months. Based on

                     these results and other research suggesting a similar effect in other solid tumor types, AIM sees an Ampligen

                     combination therapy as having potential across multiple types of cancers. Additional clinical studies are

                     underway and planned in many of these types of tumors to further confirm these effects.”

In March 2021, we were granted a patent by the Netherlands Patent Office with granted patent claims that include, but are not limited to, the use of Ampligen as a combination cancer therapy with checkpoint blockade inhibitors (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab). We believe that the above positive data makes this patent have heightened potential. Similar patents are pending in other countries.

 

     ●    Stage 4 Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Phase 1 study of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using chemokine

           modulation therapy, including Ampligen and pembrolizumab. Eight patients were enrolled and 6 patients were evaluable.

           https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03599453. The key findings announced in April 2022

           included:

 

               ○    The pre-determined primary endpoint of efficacy was met (increase in CD8 in TME).

 

               ○    Uniform increase of immune markers upon treatment was observed: CD8 mRNA (6.1-fold; p-0.034), GZMB mRNA (3.5-fold;

                     p=0.058), ratios of CD8 /FOXP3 and GZMB/FOXP3 (5.7-fold; p=0.036, and 7.6-fold; p=0.024 respectively), thus

                     successfully meeting the pre-determined primary endpoint in the study (increase in CD8 in

                     TME).

 

               ○    In addition, an increase in CTL attractants CXCL10 (2.6-fold; p=0.104) and CCL5 (3.3-fold; p=0.019) was observed.

                     In contrast, Treg marker FOXP3 or Treg attractants CCL22 or CXCL12 were not

                     enhanced.

 

               ○    Three patients had stable disease lasting 2.4, 2.5 and 3.8 months, as of data cut off September 1, 2021.

 

 

               ○    An additional patient (non-evaluable) had a partial response (breast tumor autoamputation) with massive tumor

                     necrosis in the post-CKM

                     biopsy.

 

     ●    Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver - Phase 2a study of Ampligen as a component of chemokine modulatory regimen

           on colorectal cancer metastatic to liver; recruitment has been completed; 19 patients were enrolled and 12 patients were

           evaluable for the primary endpoint https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03403634. The key findings announced in April 2022

           included:

 

               ○    The study’s primary endpoint was met, evidenced by increased CD8a expression post-treatment (p=0.046).

 

               ○    Saw increase in the CD8a/CD4 (p=0.03), CD8a/FOXP3 (p<0.01) and GZMB/FOXP3 (p<0.01) ratios.

 

               ○    The expression of CTL-attracting chemokines CCL5 (p=0.08), CXCL9 (p=0.05), and CXCL10 (p=0.06) were increased,

                     while expression of the Treg/MDSC attractant CXCL12 (p=0.07) was decreased

                     post-treatment.

 

               ○    Median OS was 10.5 (90% CI 2.2-15.2) months, and the median PFS was 1.5 (90% CI 1.4, 1.8) months.

 

               ○    No tumor responses were seen. The treatment was well tolerated. Of all enrolled patients (N=19), adverse events

                     were noted in 74% of patients, with the most common being fatigue (58%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were

                     rare

                     (5%).

 

                                                                   24

 

 

     ●    Early-Stage Prostate Cancer - Phase 2 study investigating the effectiveness and safety of aspirin and Ampligen with or

           without interferon-alpha 2b (Intron A) compared to no drug treatments in a randomized three-arm study of patients with

           prostate cancer before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patient enrollment has been initiated in this study designed for up

           to 45 patients. The study is temporarily suspended due to the Merck discontinuation of Intron-A production. Roswell Park has

           had a Type-C meeting with the FDA and is currently performing the necessary experiments to replace Intron-A with a generic

           alpha-interferon. We expect this trial to resume in the near future.

           https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03899987

 

     ●    Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer - The objective of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability

           of a combination of Ampligen, celecoxib with or without Intron A, when given along with chemotherapy in patients with

           early-stage triple negative breast cancer. The now completed (as of September 2022) topline results from the study confirm

           the positive findings that were previously presented at the 2022 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 37th Annual

           Meeting in a poster presentation titled Safety and efficacy of de-escalated neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy of triple

           negative breast cancer (TNBC) using chemokine-modulating regimen (rintatolimod, IFN-α2b, celecoxib). The primary endpoint

           of the study was safety and tolerability. The results demonstrated that treatment was well-tolerated with mostly grade 1 or

           2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) without dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or delayed or immune-related toxicities.

           DLT was defined as grade 3 or higher toxicities within the first 3 weeks. Secondary endpoints included pCR rate where 5/9

           (56%) of patients attained pCR and 1 more patient attained ypTmic. Tumor and blood biomarkers were also analyzed in

           exploratory studies.

     ●    Refractory Melanoma — Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (“Roswell Park”), in a clinical trial fully funded by the

           National Cancer Institute (NCI), has commenced patient enrollment in its Phase 2 study in subjects with primary PD-1/PD-L1

           resistant melanoma. The Phase 2 study will evaluate type-1 polarized dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccine in combination with

           tumor-selective chemokine modulation (“CKM”) comprised of Interferon alpha 2b, Ampligen (rintatolimod) and Celecoxib. Up to

           24 patients are to be enrolled. The study was temporarily suspended due to the Merck discontinuation of Intron-A production

           but has since resumed recruitment (See:

           https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04093323).

 

     ●    Metastatic or Unresectable Triple Negative Breast Cancer – This phase ½a trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose

           of chemokine modulation therapy (CKM) (rintatolimod, celecoxib, and interferon alpha 2b) in combination with pembrolizumab

           for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site)

           to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). The study is recruiting

           subjects.

Additional Progress and Analysis Related to Pancreatic Cancer

 

In January 2017, the EAP established under our agreement with myTomorrows to enable access of Ampligen to ME/CFS patients was extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. In February 2018, the agreement with myTomorrows was extended to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval. There have been no physician requests to date that would cause the program to move forward with the approval process.

 

A total of 42 pancreatic cancer patients initially received treatment with Ampligen immuno-oncology therapy under the EAP program at Erasmus MC in the Netherlands; that initial program has since continued to expand and proceed with additional patients to be treated with Ampligen supervised by Prof. C.H.J. van Eijck, MD. In March 2024, the team at Erasmus MC published a thorough data analysis in an article titled “Rintatolimod in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer enhances Anti-Tumor Immunity through Dendritic Cell-Mediated T Cell Responses” in the journal Clinical Cancer Research. The positive clinical findings relate to changes in the tumor microenvironment after Ampligen use. We are working with our Contract Research Organization, Amarex Clinical Research LLC, to seek FDA “fast-track.” We have applied for fast-track status; have received denials to date; and are currently working through the FDA process to provide all the materials and information required to achieve fast-track status.

 

In January 2023, we entered into an external sponsored collaborative clinical research agreement with Erasmus MC and AstraZeneca. Under the agreement, Erasmus MC is planning to perform an investigator-initiated clinical study, entitled “Combining anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab with TLR-3 agonist rintatolimod in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for therapy effect. DURIPANC Study,” in which it will use study drugs provided by both AstraZeneca and us. In June 2023 we received the required approvals from the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, which is the Competent Authority for the review of clinical trials in the Netherlands, and the Medical Ethics Review Committee Erasmus MC, which is the governing ethics board. The study is open and is recruiting subjects.

 

                                                                   25

 

 

Additionally:

 

     ●    In December 2020, the FDA granted Ampligen Orphan Drug Designation status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The Orphan

           Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the

           treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects less than 200,000 persons in

           the United States or meets cost recovery provisions of the act. The status helps incentivize the treatment of therapies to

           treat unmet medical needs by providing a company with seven years of exclusivity rights once a drug reaches

           market.

 

     ●    In February 2021, our subsidiary, NV Hemispherx Biopharma Europe, received formal notification from the European Commission

           (“EC”) granting Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for Ampligen as a treatment for pancreatic cancer. Orphan products,

           once commercially approved in the European Union (“EU”), receive benefits including up to ten years of protection from

           market competition from similar medicines with similar active component and indication for use that are not shown to be

           clinically

           superior.

 

In June 2021, Ampligen was featured in a publication containing state-of-the-art methodologies in the peer-reviewed medical journal Cancers as a potential treatment option for cancer patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study’s authors stated that Ampligen has the potential to reduce the severity of the deadly respiratory disease COVID-19. According to laboratory data presented in the publication, “Rintatolimod [Ampligen] activated the innate and the adaptive immune systems by activating a cascade of actions in human pancreatic cancer cells”, including:

 

     ●    Stimulation of interferon regulatory factors and activation of the interferon signaling pathway,

     ●    Production of immunomodulatory activity and

     ●    Induction of the expression of MHC class I and II histocompatibility

 

The full journal article is titled: “Rintatolimod Induces Antiviral Activities in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells: Opening for an Anti-COVID-19 Opportunity in Cancer Patients?” Cancers is a peer-reviewed, open access journal of oncology published semimonthly online by MDPI. The study’s authors include Prof. C.H.J. van Eijck, MD, PhD, the lead investigator at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands.

 

In October 2021, we and Amarex submitted an IND application with the FDA for a planned Phase 2 study of Ampligen as a therapy for locally advanced or metastatic late-stage pancreatic cancer. In December 2021, the FDA responded with a Clinical Hold on the proposed study. We submitted our response to the FDA in February 2022. In March 2022, we received notification from the FDA that the Clinical Hold was released and cleared, meaning that we are now able to proceed with the study specifically to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients. In August 2022, we received IRB approval of the trial protocol and so announced the trial’s commencement. The study is recruiting patients.

 

Positive data was published in March 2022 in a manuscript titled, “Rintatolimod (Ampligen®) enhances numbers of peripheral B cells and is associated with longer survival in patients with locally advanced and metastasized pancreatic cancer pre-treated with FOLFIRINOX: a single-center named patient program,” in Cancers Special Issue: Combination and Innovative Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer. In the single-center, named-patient program, patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) or metastatic disease were treated with Ampligen for 6 weeks, at 2 doses per week with 400 mg per infusion. The study found that Ampligen improved the median survival of these patients. The study’s primary endpoints were the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SIII), the Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), and absolute counts of 18 different populations of circulating immune cells as measured by flow cytometry. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The median overall survival in the Ampligen group was 19 months, compared to a historical control group and subgroup (7.5 and 12.5, respectively) that did not receive Ampligen.

 

Also in March 2022, we announced that study data evaluating the direct effects of Ampligen on human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells was accepted for presentation at the 15th Annual International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association World Congress in New York, NY. For the study, three PDAC cell lines (CFPAC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and PANC-1) were treated with various concentrations of Ampligen and their corresponding vehicle control. The proliferation and migration effects were examined using in-vitro assays and the molecular effect was examined by targeted gene expression profiling. Additionally human PDAC samples were used to validate the expression of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by immunohistochemistry. Results from the study demonstrated Ampligen decreased the proliferation and migration ability of CFPAC-1 cells. In addition, it decreased the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2 cells and the migration of PANC-1 cells. However, it did not have a dual effect in MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Interestingly, TLR3 was highly expressed in CFPAC-1 cells, low expressed in MIAPaCa-2 and not expressed in PANC-1. Gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of interferon-related genes, chemokines, interleukins and cell cycle regulatory genes. The heterogeneity of TLR3 expression was confirmed in human PDAC samples. Based on these results, treating pancreatic cancer with Ampligen may have a direct anti-tumor effect in pancreatic cancer cells expressing TLR-3.

 

                                                                   26

 

 

Ampligen as a Potential Antiviral

 

Following the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2002-03, Ampligen exhibited excellent antiviral properties and protective survival effect in NIH-contracted studies of SARS-CoV-1-infected mice, which is very similar to SARS-CoV-2, the novel virus that causes COVID-19.

 

     ●    The Barnard 2006 study (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095632020601700505) found that Ampligen reduced virus

           lung levels to below detectable

           limits.

 

     ●    The Day 2009 study (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209005832) found that, instead of 100%

           mortality, there was 100% protective survival using

           Ampligen.

 

We compared key transcription regulatory sequences of SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 and found significant similarities, suggesting highly probable extension of the antiviral effects of Ampligen in the earlier NIH-contracted SARS experiments to COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus – which causes COVID-19 – shares important genomic and pathogenic similarities with SARS-CoV-1 (hence its name). Since Ampligen has shown antiviral activity against more distantly related coronaviruses, there was a reasonable probability that the antiviral effects of Ampligen against SARS-CoV-1 will likely extend to SARS-CoV-2, and as discussed below, recently, Ampligen has demonstrated ex vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We believe that this creates a compelling case for clinical trials to evaluate Ampligen as a potential tool in the fight against COVID-19.

 

Since the late 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we have been actively engaged in determining whether Ampligen could be an effective treatment for this virus or could be part of a vaccine. We believe that Ampligen has the potential to be both an early-onset treatment for and prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. We believe that prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against the new virus.

 

In February 2020, we filed three provisional patent applications related to Ampligen in our efforts toward joining the global health community in the fight against the deadly coronavirus (See: https://aimimmuno.com/press-release/aim-immunotech-files-provisional-patent-application-for-the-use-of-ampligenr-as-a-potential-therapy-for-covid-19-induced-chronic-fatigue/). Our three provisional patent applications include: 1) Ampligen as a therapy for the coronavirus; 2) Ampligen as part of a proposed intranasal universal coronavirus vaccine that combines Ampligen with inactivated coronavirus, conveying immunity and cross-protection and; 3) a high-volume manufacturing process for Ampligen. Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, which provides international protections for patents, these three provisional patent applications were converted into two international patent applications based on the date of their filings.

 

In August 2020, we contracted Amarex to act as our Clinical Research Organization and provide regulatory support with regard to a possible clinical trial testing Ampligen’s potential as a COVID-19 prophylaxis via intranasal delivery.

 

Beginning in April 2020, we entered into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with numerous companies for the potential outsourcing of the production of polymer, enzyme, placebo as well as Ampligen, and one Contract Research Organization, Amarex, which will provide regulatory and monitoring support related to a clinical trial testing Ampligen’s intranasal safety and potential as a COVID-19 prophylaxis via intranasal delivery.

 

In May 2020, the FDA authorized an IND for Roswell Park to conduct a Phase 1/2a study of a regimen of Ampligen and interferon alpha in cancer patients with COVID-19 infections. This clinical trial, sponsored by Roswell Park in collaboration with us, will test the safety of this combination regimen in patients with cancer and COVID-19, and the extent to which this therapy will promote clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the upper airway. Several subjects have been treated. It is planned that the phase 1/2a study will enroll up to 44 patients in two stages. Phase 1 will see 12-24 patients receiving both Ampligen and interferon alpha-2b at escalating doses. Once that initial phase is complete, further study participants will be randomized to two arms: one receiving the two-drug combination and a control group who will not receive Ampligen or interferon alpha but will receive best available care. We are a financial sponsor of the study and will provide Ampligen at no charge for this study. In November 2020, the first patient in the study had been enrolled and treated. This study was amended to add 20 patients, with 10 randomized to receive a single dose of Ampligen and 10 patients to receive current best therapies. (See clinicaltrials.gov/NCT04379518). Due to a shortage of qualifying subjects with COVID-19 and cancer as a result of the positive impact of vaccinations and treatments for COVID-19, Roswell is seeking approval to expand the qualifying subject criteria to include other diseases lethal to immuno-compromised cancer patients, such as influenza. Accordingly, the study is temporarily suspended while seeking said approvals.

 

We also entered into a specialized services agreement with Utah State University and have supplied Ampligen to support the University’s Institute for Viral Research in its research into SARS-CoV-2. The Utah State results show that Ampligen was able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral yields by 90% at clinically achievable intranasal Ampligen dosage levels.

 

                                                                   27

 

 

In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms. Patients in the trial are treated with our flagship pipeline drug Ampligen. In January 2021, we commenced with the treatment of the first previously diagnosed COVID-19 patient with long-COVID symptoms (i.e., Long Hauler) also known as Post-COVID Conditions in the AMP-511 study. Enrollment of post-COVID patients continues in the study.

 

In January 2021, we entered into a Sponsor Agreement with CHDR to manage a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and activity of repeated intranasal administration of Ampligen. AIM funded and sponsored the study. This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and biological activity of repeated administration of Ampligen intranasally. A total of 40 healthy subjects received either Ampligen or a placebo in the trial, with the Ampligen given at four escalating dosages across four cohorts, to a maximum level of 1,250 micrograms. The study was completed, and the Final Safety Report reported no Serious or Severe Adverse Events at any dosage level. We believe that the trial is a critical step in our ongoing efforts to develop Ampligen as a potential prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19 and other respiratory viral diseases. Amarex provided us with monitoring support during the trial.

 

Additionally, we filed two COVID-19-related provisional patent applications in the third quarter of 2021. In August, we filed an application for Ampligen as both an intranasal and an intravenous therapy for what we describe as Post-COVID conditions. The people suffering from Post-COVID conditions, including some young adults, can be afflicted with severe difficulties in concentrating; serious memory problems; and the inability to live an active lifestyle, to work and even to perform everyday tasks. Early data has demonstrated that patients with symptoms of Post-COVID conditions being treated with Ampligen in the ongoing AMP-511 Expanded Access Program have reported improvements in fatigue symptoms. Similarly, in ME/CFS, data supports the claim that Ampligen improves fatigue symptoms. Then in September 2022, we filed a patent application for Ampligen as a potential early-onset intranasal therapy designed to enhance and expand infection-induced immunity, epitope spreading, cross-reactivity and cross-protection in patients exposed to a wide range of RNA respiratory viruses, such as influenza, Rhinoviruses and SARS-CoV-2.

 

In addition to securing these two provisional patent applications, we also moved forward with proposed studies in these areas and with Pre-Investigational New Drug Applications in September 2021. One pre-IND was for a Phase 2, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ampligen in patients experiencing Post-COVID conditions (originally referred to as Post-COVID Cognitive Dysfunction (PCCD) and has been revised to Post-COVID conditions).

 

Ampligen as a Treatment for Post-COVID Conditions

 

In July 2023, we enrolled and dosed the first patient in our Phase 2 study evaluating Ampligen® as a potential therapeutic for people with post-COVID conditions (“AMP-518”). We announced in August 2023 that the study had met the planned enrollment of 80 subjects ages 18 to 60 years who have been randomized 1:1 to receive twice-weekly intravenous infusions of Ampligen or placebo for 12 weeks, with a follow-up phase of two weeks. All patients have completed the study and topline data was reported in February 2024.

 

On May 9, 2023, we were granted a U.S. Patent for a method for preventing or reducing antigenic drift or viral reassortment in a host animal comprising determining if a host animal has been exposed to or infected by an avian influenza virus and administering to the exposed host animal alpha-interferon.

 

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)

 

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), also known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (“CFIDS”) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem. ME/CFS is recognized by both the government and private sector as a significant unmet medical need, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), FDA and the CDC. The CDC states on its website at https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/ that “Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with ME/CFS are often not able to do their usual activities. At times, ME/CFS may confine them to bed. People with ME/CFS have severe fatigue and sleep problems. ME/CFS may get worse after people with the illness try to do as much as they want or need to do. This symptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). Other symptoms can include problems with thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness.”

 

Many severe ME/CFS patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest. ME/CFS is characterized by incapacitating fatigue with profound exhaustion and extremely poor stamina, sleep difficulties and problems with concentration and short-term memory. It is also accompanied by flu-like symptoms, pain in the joints and muscles, tender lymph nodes, sore throat and new headaches. A distinctive characteristic of the illness is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion, which do not subside with rest.

 

                                                                   28

 

 

The high number of younger people being hospitalized for COVID-19 suggests considerable numbers of people in the prime of their lives may have a COVID-induced ME/CFS-like illness in their future. According to a 2016 journal article, the estimated annual cost of lost productivity related to ME/CFS was $9-37 billion in the United States, and for direct medical costs it was $9-14 billion.

 

In June of 2020, we filed a provisional patent application for, among other discoveries, the use of Ampligen as a potential early-onset therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 induced chronic fatigue.

 

Many survivors of the first SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 continued to report chronic fatigue, difficulty sleeping and shortness of breath months after recovering from the acute illness. “After one year, 17% of patients had not returned to work and 9% more had not returned to their pre-SARS work levels,” according to Simmaron Research. Now there is increasing evidence that patients with COVID-19 can develop a similar, ME/CFS-like illness. These patients are commonly referred to as “Long Haulers.”

 

In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms. For more information on our AMP-511 Expanded Access Program, please see “OUR PRODUCTS: Ampligen” above.

 

In November 2020, we announced the publication of statistically significant data detailing how Ampligen could have a considerable positive impact on people living with ME/CFS when administered in the early stages of the disease. The data were published in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science. AIM researchers found that the TLR3 agonist Ampligen substantially improved physical performance in a subset of ME/CFS patients.

 

As noted above in Overview; General; Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS, we have long been focused on seeking the FDA’s approval for the use of Ampligen to treat ME/CFS. In fact, in February 2013, we received a CRL from the FDA for our Ampligen NDA for ME/CFS, stating that we should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses.

 

While developing a comprehensive response to the FDA and a plan for a confirmatory trial for the FDA NDA, we proceeded independently in Argentina and, in August 2016, we received approval of an NDA from ANMAT for commercial sale of Ampligen in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. On June 10, 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. The next steps in the commercial launch of Ampligen include ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. This testing and approval process is currently delayed due to ANMAT’s internal processes. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina.

 

We plan on a comprehensive follow through with the FDA regarding the use of Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS. We have learned a great deal since the FDA’s CRL and plan to adjust our approach to concentrate on specific ME/CFS symptoms. Responses to the CRL and a proposed confirmatory trial are being worked on now by our R&D team and consultants.

 

Other Diseases

 

In Europe, the EMA has approved the Orphan Medicinal Products Designation for Ampligen as a potential treatment of Ebola virus disease and for Alferon N Injection as a potential treatment of MERS.

 

We concluded our series of collaborations designed to determine the potential effectiveness of Ampligen and Alferon N Injection as potential preventive and/or therapeutic treatments for Ebola-related disorders. Although we believe that the threat of both MERS and Ebola globally may reemerge in the future, it appears that the spread of these disorders has diminished.

 

In April 2021, we entered into an MTA with the University of Cagliari Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita e dell’Ambiente (“UNICA”), an educational institution, under the laws of Italy, located in Monserrato (Cagliari), Italy. The MTA relates to the research and development of the effects of Ampligen and its ability to induce interferon production in several cell lines, and also on the ability of the Ebola virus protein VP35 to bind to viral dsRNA and impede interferon’s upregulation and activity, and on Ampligen’s ability to reverse VP35 inhibition of interferon production in biological systems. The data analysis was published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research, in a manuscript titled “Ebola virus disease: In vivo protection provided by the PAMP restricted TLR3 agonist rintatolimod and its mechanism of action.” We believe that the analysis supports a dual mechanism of action when Ampligen is used as a prophylactic therapy against Ebola Virus Disease.

 

                                                                   29

 

 

In May 2021, we filed a U.S. Provisional Patent Application for Ampligen as a potential therapeutic to possibly slow, halt, or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

 

In November 2022, we received notice that the FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation to Ampligen for the treatment of Ebola virus disease.

 

Alferon N Injection®

 

Alferon N Injection is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon. Alferon N Injection is the only natural-source, multi-species alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the United States and Argentina for the intralesional (within lesions) treatment of refractory (resistant to other treatment) or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Alferon N Injection is also approved in Argentina for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferons. Argentina has experienced hyper-inflation and recently devalued its currency to the U.S. dollar by 50%. Contracts with GP Pharm are U.S. dollar contracts and the parties must evaluate the impact of the recent devaluation on its relationship. Certain types of human papilloma viruses (“HPV”) cause genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). According to the CDC, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, with approximately 79 million Americans — most in their late teens and early 20s — infected with HPV. In fact, the CDC states that “HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives.” Although they do not usually result in death, genital warts commonly recur, causing significant morbidity and entail substantial health care costs.

 

Interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases. Researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon: alpha, beta, gamma and omega. Alferon N Injection contains a multi-species form of alpha interferon. The worldwide market for injectable alpha interferon-based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide. Alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways: by genetic engineering, by cell culture, and from human white blood cells. All three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the United States. Our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells. The potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant (i.e., synthetic) interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions. Natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon. In contrast, commercial recombinant alpha interferon products each contain only a single species. Researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus. Natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species, which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies. Natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated (i.e., partially covered with sugar molecules). Such glycosylation is not present on the currently U.S.-marketed recombinant alpha interferons. We believe that the absence of glycosylation may be in part responsible for the production of interferon-neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon. Although cell culture-derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species, the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon.

 

Alferon N Injection [Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived)] is a highly purified, natural-source, glycosylated, multi-species alpha interferon product. There are essentially no neutralizing antibodies observed against Alferon N Injection to date and the product has a relatively low side-effect profile. The recombinant DNA derived alpha interferon formulations have been reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year of treatment, probably due to neutralizing antibody formation (See “Manufacturing” and “Marketing/Distribution” sections below for more details on the manufacture and marketing/distribution of Alferon N Injection). The production of new Alferon N Injection Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, or API, is currently on hold. We do not know when, if ever, our products will be generally available for commercial sale for any indication. Additionally, on May 9, 2023, we were granted a U.S. Patent for a method for preventing or reducing antigenic drift or viral reassortment in a host animal comprising determining if a host animal has been exposed to or infected by an avian influenza virus and administering to the exposed host animal alpha-interferon.

 

MANUFACTURING

 

ANMAT in Argentina approved Ampligen for commercial distribution for the treatment of CFS in 2016. Shipment of the drug product to Argentina was initiated in 2018 to complete the release testing by ANMAT needed for commercial distribution. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. In June 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. We are currently working with GP Pharm on the commercial launch of Ampligen in Argentina (See “Our Products; Ampligen” above).

 

                                                                   30

 

 

Following our approval in Argentina, in 2017 we engaged Jubilant HollisterStier (“Jubilant”) to be our authorized CMO for Ampligen. Two lots of Ampligen consisting of more than 16,000 units were manufactured and released in 2018; these lots have been designated for human use in the United States in the cost recovery CFS program and for expanded oncology clinical trials. The production of additional polymer (Ampligen intermediates) took place in 2019 at our New Brunswick facility. Additionally, Jubilant manufactured two more lots of Ampligen in December 2019 and January 2020. The current manufactured lots of Ampligen have been fully tested and released for commercial product launch in Argentina and for clinical trials. In addition, we have supplied GP Pharm with the Ampligen required for testing and ANMAT release. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, we anticipate that GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina.

 

In December 2020, we added Pii as a “Fill & Finish” provider to enhance our capacity to produce Ampligen. This addition amplifies our manufacturing capability by providing redundancy and cost savings. The contracts augment our existing fill and finish capacity. We are prepared to initiate the production of additional Ampligen when and if needed.

 

In June 2022 we entered into a lease agreement with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for a 5,210 square-foot, state-of-the-art R&D facility at the New Jersey Bioscience Center (NJBC), primarily consisting of two separate laboratory suites. The lease commenced on July 1, 2022, and runs through August 31, 2027, but can be extended for an additional five-year period. The facility is AIM’s operations, research and development center.

 

Our business plan calls for the utilization of one or more CMOs to produce Ampligen API. While we believe we have sufficient Ampligen API to meet our current needs, we are also continually exploring new efficiencies so as to maximize our ability to fulfill future obligations. In this regard, on December 5, 2022, we entered into a Master Service Agreement and a Quality Agreement with Sterling Pharma Solutions (“Sterling”) for the manufacture of our Poly I and Poly C12U polynucleotides and transfer of associated test methods at Sterling’s Dudley, UK location to produce the polymer precursors to manufacture the drug Ampligen. We are utilizing Sterling’s expertise to refine our approach to polymer production. While we believe we have sufficient Ampligen API to meet current needs, we are also continually exploring new efficiencies in order to maximize its ability to fulfill future obligations. In March 2023, we submitted a work order for a total of $1,432,257 to manufacture additional lots of Ampligen at Jubilant.

 

Our second product, Alferon N Injection, is approved by the FDA for commercial sales in the United States for the treatment of genital warts. It is also approved by ANMAT in Argentina for commercial sales for the treatment of genital warts and in patients who are refractory to treatment with recombinant interferons. Commercial sales of Alferon N Injection in the United States will not resume until new batches of commercial filled and finished product are produced and released by the FDA. We will need the FDA’s approval to release commercial product once we have identified our new manufacturing approach and submitted satisfactory stability and quality release data. Currently, we are not manufacturing Alferon N Injection and there is no definitive timetable to resume production.

 

LICENSING/COLLABORATIONS/JOINT VENTURES

 

To enable potential availability of Ampligen to patients on a worldwide basis, we have embarked on a strategy to license the product and/or to collaborate and/or create a joint venture with companies that have the demonstrated capabilities and commitment to successfully gain approval and commercialize Ampligen in their respective global territories of the world. Ideal partners would have the following characteristics: well-established global and regional experience and coverage; robust commercial infrastructure; a strong track record of successful development and registration of in-licensed products; and a therapeutic area fit (e.g., ME/CFS, immuno-oncology).

 

MARKETING/DISTRIBUTION

 

In May 2016, we entered into a five-year, exclusive Renewed Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GP Pharm. Under this Agreement, GP Pharm was responsible for gaining regulatory approval in Argentina for Ampligen to treat severe CFS in Argentina and for commercializing Ampligen for this indication in Argentina. We granted GP Pharm the right to expand rights to sell this experimental therapeutic into other Latin America countries based upon GP Pharm achieving certain performance milestones. We also granted GP Pharm an option to market Alferon N Injection in Argentina and other Latin America countries (See “Our Products; Ampligen” above). The GP Pharm contract was extended in May 2021, and will now end on May 24, 2024. In August 2021, ANMAT granted a five-year extension to a previous approval to sell and distribute Ampligen to treat severe CFS in Argentina. This extends the approval until 2026.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement (the “Impatients Agreement”) with Impatients, N.V. (“myTomorrows”), a Netherlands-based company, for the commencement and management of an EAP in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, myTomorrows, as our exclusive service provider and distributor in the Territory, is performing EAP activities. These activities will be directed to (a) the education of physicians and patients regarding the possibility of early access to innovative medical treatments not yet the subject of a Marketing Authorization (regulatory approval) through named-patient use, compassionate use, expanded access and hospital exemption, (b) patient and physician outreach related to a patient-physician platform, (c) the securing of Early Access Approvals (exemptions and/or waivers required by regulatory authorities for medical treatments prior to Marketing Authorization) for the use of such treatments, (d) the distribution and sale of such treatments pursuant to such Early Access Approvals, (e) pharmacovigilance (drug safety) activities and/or (f) the collection of data such as patient-reported outcomes, doctor-reported experiences and registry data. We are supporting these efforts and supplying Ampligen to myTomorrows at a predetermined transfer price. In the event that we receive Marketing Authorization in any country in the Territory, we will pay myTomorrows a royalty on products sold. Pursuant to the Impatients Agreement, the royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the Impatients Agreement) of Ampligen sold in the Territory where Marketing Authorization was obtained. The formula to determine the percentage of Net Sales will be based on the number of patients that are entered into the EAP. We believe that disclosure of the exact maximum royalty rate and royalty termination date could cause competitive harm. However, to assist the public in gauging these terms, the actual maximum royalty rate is somewhere between 2% and 10% and the royalty termination date is somewhere between five and fifteen years from the First Commercial Sale of a product within a specific country. The parties established a Joint Steering Committee comprised of representatives of both parties to oversee the EAP. No assurance can be given that activities under the EAP will result in Marketing Authorization or the sale of substantial amounts of Ampligen in the Territory. The agreement was automatically extended for a period of 12 months on May 20, 2021; has been automatically extended for 12 months on each subsequent May 20; and will continue to be automatically extended for periods of 12 months every May 20 until terminated or the terms of the agreement are met.

 

In January 2017, ANMAT granted a five-year extension to a previous approval to sell and distribute Alferon N Injection (under the brand name “Naturaferon”) in Argentina. This extended the approval until 2022. A request to extend the approval beyond 2022 has been filed and is still under review. In February 2013, we received ANMAT approval for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferon, with Naturaferon in Argentina.

 

In January 2017, the EAP through our agreement with myTomorrows designed to enable access of Ampligen to ME/CFS patients was extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in the Territory and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program.

 

In August 2017, we extended our agreement with Asembia LLC, formerly Armada Healthcare, LLC, to undertake the marketing, education and sales of Alferon N Injection throughout the United States. This agreement has expired. We were in discussions with Asembia about the possibility of continuing the relationship, while also exploring the possibility of working with other, similar companies. However, we still do not foresee an immediate need for this service and continue to push this search further out in our expected timeline.

 

In February 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows. This amendment extended the Territory to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval. In March 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows, pursuant to which myTomorrows will be our exclusive service provider for special access activities in Canada for the supply of Ampligen for the treatment of ME/CFS.

 

In December 2020, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to 16 pancreatic cancer patients. In November 2021, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to an additional 5 pancreatic cancer patients. In March 2022, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to an additional 10 pancreatic cancer patients. In November 2022, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to an additional 10 pancreatic cancer patients.

 

401(k) Plan

 

We have a defined contribution plan, entitled the AIM ImmunoTech Employees 401(k) Plan and Trust Agreement (the “401(k) Plan”). Our full-time employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan following 61 days of employment. Subject to certain limitations imposed by federal tax laws, participants are eligible to contribute up to 15% of their salary (including bonuses and/or commissions) per annum. Participants’ contributions to the 401(k) Plan may be matched by us at a rate determined annually by the Board of Directors.

 

Each participant immediately vests in his or her deferred salary contributions as well as the Company’s safe harbor contributions. A 6% safe harbor matching contribution by us was reinstated effective January 1, 2021. For the three months ending March 31, 2024 we made approximately $43,800 in contributions, and for the year ending December 31, 2023 approximately $162,000 in contributions were made.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Part II; Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Critical Accounting Policies” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Three months ended March 31, 2024 versus three months ended March 31, 2023

 

Net Loss

 

Our net loss was approximately $5,817,000 and $3,661,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing an increase in loss of approximately $2,156,000 or 59%. This increase in loss was primarily due to the following:

 

     ●    a decrease in gain from sale of Income tax operating loss of $255,000; and

     ●    a decrease in revenue of $9,000; and

     ●    a decrease in interest and other income of 118,000; and

     ●    an increase in loss on investments, net of $295,000; and

     ●    an increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,523,000; and

     ●    an increase in interest expense of $72,000; and

     ●    an increase in production costs of $8,000; offset by

     ●    a decrease in loss on sale of fixed assets of $23,000; and

     ●    a decrease in research and development expenses of $101,000.

 

Net loss per share was $ (0.12) and $(0.08) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2024, was 49,458,023 as compared to 48,399,950 as of March 31, 2023.

 

Revenues

 

Revenues from our Ampligen® Cost Recovery Program were $40,000 and $49,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of $9,000 which is primarily related to the fluctuation of patient participation.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no Alferon N Injection® Finished Good product to commercially sell and all revenue was generated from the EAP and our FDA approved open-label treatment protocol, (“AMP 511”), that allows patient access to Ampligen® for treatment in an open-label safety study.

 

Gain (loss) on Investments, net

 

Gain (loss) on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 was approximately $(92,000) and $203,000, respectively, reflecting an increase in the loss on investments of approximately ($295,000). The increase in loss was due to the change in the fair value of equity investments.

 

Production Costs

 

Production costs were approximately $8,000 and $0, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, representing an increase of $8,000 in production costs in the current period. The increase was due primarily to the sale of the New Brunswick facility and there was no production for the three months ended March 31, 2023 whereas there was production costs in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Gain (loss) from sale of income tax operating loss

 

The quarterly income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $0 compared to a gain of $255,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This was due to the lifetime limit of $20,000,000 for the sale of the New Jersey NOL being reached and therefore no tax provision was calculated in 2024.

 

                                                                   33

 

 

Research and Development Costs

 

Overall Research and Development (“R&D”) costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were approximately $1,951,000, as compared to $2,052,000 for the same period a year ago, reflecting a decrease of approximately $101,000. The primary reason for the decrease in R&D costs was a decrease in outside contractors of $229,000, as well a decrease in clinical expenses of $63,000 offset by an increase in consultant fees of $112,000, salaries of $61,000, manufacturing expenses of $9,000, and insurance of $9,000.

 

General and Administrative Expenses

 

General and Administrative (“G&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, were approximately $3,815,000 and $2,292,000, respectively, reflecting an increase of approximately $1,523,000. The increase in G&A expenses during the current period was due primarily to an increase in legal professional fees of $1,571,000.

 

Interest Expenses

 

Interest expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $72,000 and there was no interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in interest expense in the current period was due to the interest expense incurred related to the Note Purchase Agreement entered into on February 16, 2024 with Streeterville.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $4,815,000 compared to approximately $3,680,000 for the same period in 2023, an increase of $1,135,000. The primary reasons for this increase in cash used in operations in 2024 was an increased net loss during the three months of $2,156,000, a decrease in gain from sale of income tax operating losses of $255,000 as well as in increase in loss on marketable investments of $295,000 which was partially offset by an increase of accrued expenses of $430,000, a decrease in accounting payable of 462,000, an increase in funds received from the 2023 sale of New Jersey net operating loss and received in 2024 of $1,184,000 and a decrease in prepaid expense of $118,000.

 

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $158,000 compared to cash used in investing activities in 2023 of approximately $78,000, representing a change of $80,000. The primary reason for the change during the current period is the net purchase and sale of marketable investments activity of $108,000 compared to $114,000 for the same period in 2023, the loss on sale of property and equipment of $0 in the current period in 2024, compared with $29,000 in the same period in 2023 as well as the purchase of patents in the current period in 2024 of $50,000 compared with the abandonment of patents in the same period in 2023 of $7,000.

 

Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $2,829,000 compared to approximately $100,000 for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of $2,729,000. The primary reason for this increase was the receipt of $2,500,000 in net proceeds from the notes payable, net of issuance cost as well as an increase in the sale of shares in the current period in 2024 of $329,000 compared to $100,000 in the same period in 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $10,942,000 in cash, cash equivalents and marketable investments, inclusive of approximately $7,647,000 in marketable investments, representing an increase of approximately $2,128,000 from December 31, 2023.

 

We are committed to a focused business plan oriented toward finding senior co-development partners with the capital and expertise needed to commercialize the many potential therapeutic aspects of our experimental drugs and our FDA approved drug Alferon N Injection.

 

The development of our products requires the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time-consuming research, preclinical development, and clinical trials that are necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to market. We believe, based on our current financial condition, that we have adequate funds to meet our anticipated operational cash needs and fund current clinical trials over approximately the next twenty-four months. At present we do not generate any material revenues from operations, and we do not anticipate doing so in the near future. We may need to obtain additional funding in the future for new studies and/or if current studies do not yield positive results, require unanticipated changes and/or additional studies. In this regard, in February 2022, the SEC declared our new S-3 shelf Registration Statement effective which will allow us to raise additional capital in the future. On April 19, 2023, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “EDA”), with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $8.5 million through Maxim, as agent. Sales under the EDA were registered under the S-3 Shelf Registration Statement. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, Maxim is entitled to a transaction fee at a fixed rate of 3.0% of the gross sales price of Shares sold under the EDA. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold 564,568 shares under the EDA for total gross proceeds of approximately $253,870, which includes a 3.0% fee to Maxim of $7,616. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 598,114 shares under the EDA for total gross proceeds of approximately $344,000, which includes a 3.0% fee to Maxim of $10,326. Subsequent to the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold 730,110 shares under the EDA for total gross proceeds of $372,223, which includes a 3.0% fee to Maxim of $11,167. We hope to raise additional funds through the EDA. In addition, we raised $2,500,000 in net proceeds from the sale of an unsecured Note and entered into an equity line of credit to raise up to 15.000,000 (see Overview; The Atlas Equity Line of Credit above). No assurance can be given as to the amount of funds that could be raised or the potential dilution to current stockholders. If we are unable to commercialize and sell Ampligen and/or recommence material sales of Alferon N Injection, our operations, financial position and liquidity may be adversely impacted, and additional financing may be required. There can be no assurances that, if needed, we will be able to raise adequate funds from the EDA or otherwise, or enter into licensing, partnering or other arrangements to advance our business goals. We may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. We are unable to estimate the amount, timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. Any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights, which are senior to those of existing stockholders. See Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors; We may require additional financing which may not be available” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

 

ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures

 

Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which have been designed to permit us to effectively identify and timely disclose important information. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024, to ensure that material information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, is appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 

Part II – OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings 

 

Please see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Since the filing of the 2023, Form 10-K:

 

AIM Immunotech, Inc. v. Tudor, et al., in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Ocala Division, Case No. 5:2022cv00323. On April 22, 2024, the District Court issued an order granting-in-part Lautz and Jorgl’s Rule 59(e) and Rule 11 motions, respectively. According to the District Court, when we filed our Amended Complaint, there was “no reasonable factual basis for [our] 13b claim against Lautz,” in light of his deposition testimony disclaiming ongoing participation in the group’s proxy fight. Furthermore, the District Court sanctioned us and our counsel, concluding that our argument regarding Jorgl’s voluntary cessation, and potential ongoing ownership, “was objectively frivolous and advanced for an improper argument” in light of Jorgl’s affidavit and redacted stock transfer form. The District Court limited Rule 11 sanctions to Jorgl’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred after March 28, 2023 and ordered further briefing on fee applications and an appropriate PSLRA sanction, with Jorgl and Lautz’s initial briefs due on May 7, 2024. On April 29, 2024, Jorgl filed an unopposed motion to extend his filing deadline to May 17, 2024. We dispute the Court’s order and we are considering whether to appeal. We believe, but cannot assure, that the potential liability is approximately, $200,000.

 

Kellner v. AIM ImmunoTech Inc. et al., in the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware, Case No. 3, 2024. On January 16, 2024, the Delaware Supreme Court granted-in-part Kellner’s motion to expedite and scheduled oral argument before the en banc Delaware Supreme Court for April 10, 2024.

 

During briefing on Kellner’s appeal and our cross-appeal, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America (the “Chamber”) sought leave on February 23, 2024 to file an amicus brief in support of us. In its proposed amicus brief, the Chamber, emphasizing the importance and ubiquity of advanced notice bylaws, explained that the Delaware Court of Chancery conflated the standards for as-applied and facial challenges, and also improperly applied heightened scrutiny in a way that would invite excessive future challenges to legitimate advanced notice bylaws. In opposing the Chamber’s motion for leave to file an amicus brief on March 4, 2024, Kellner questioned both the relevance and novelty of the Chamber’s arguments, while also attacking the Chamber’s independence. The Delaware Supreme Court granted the Chamber’s motion in a March 18, 2024 summary order. On April 10, 2024, the en banc Delaware Supreme Court heard oral argument from AIM and Kellner in this matter and took the matter under consideration.

 

ITEM 1A: Risk Factors 

 

Please carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. The risks described in the above reports are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Please also see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.
