ELVICTOR GROUP, INC

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

 

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

Elvictor Group, Inc., formerly known as Thenablers, Inc. (“Elvictor Group, Inc.” or the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 3, 2017. With the change to the Elvictor name came the addition of the brand and a new team in crew management in the shipping industry. The new management team comes from Elvictor (the Greece-based private entity founded in 1977, which is the predecessor to the company whose business became a part of the business of Thenablers in 2019, the “Elvictor Greece”) that has been active across various value-adding activities of the shipping sector, such as ship management, technical management, crewing & crew management. The Company’s professional core of activities includes crew management, training and the creation of in-house software related to crew and ship matters, for the amelioration of all its operations, facilitating both its employees and those that depend on them. The Company aims to broaden its scope of activities, expanding on to new areas, while refining the existing ones. Placing prime importance on digitalization, the Company plans on the extensive use of Artificial Intelligence, through the application of Machine and Deep Learning, in concert with the integration of a wide array of cloud systems. The Company’s strategic growth on a horizontal and vertical manner throughout the shipping industry will be reinforced with technologically adept tools, containing know-how and experience. Working on a technologically oriented path, the Company is flexible and open to other avenues of international business for the successful and profitable diversification of its portfolio.

 

On December 13, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from “Thenablers, Inc.” to “Elvictor Group, Inc.” (the “Name Change”), to better reflect its new business interests. On February 25, 2020, FINRA approved the Name Change and the Company’s new stock symbol, “ELVG”.

 

As of July 10, 2020, the Company founded Elvictor Group Hellas Single Member S.A., a subsidiary in Vari, Greece, to assist the management in facilitating the Company’s operations. Additionally, the Company purchased Ultra Ship Management, a Marshall Islands company that became the Company’s subsidiary in Vari, Greece and is licensed to provide ship management services.

 

In January 2022, the Company established its fully owned subsidiary, ELVG Crew Management Ltd, incorporated in Cyprus, to facilitate its crew management operations.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURES POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying Unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and have been consistently applied. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, but which are not required for interim reporting purposes, have been omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position as of March 31, 2024, and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2024. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by Elvictor Group, Inc as of March 31, 2024, and the results of the controlled subsidiaries in Vari Greece, the Marshall Islands and Cyprus for the three months then ended. Elvictor Group, Inc and its subsidiaries together are referred to in this financial report as the unaudited condensed consolidated entity. The effects of all transactions between entities in the unaudited condensed consolidated entity are eliminated in full. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies.

 

5

 

 

Accounting Basis

 

The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments with maturities of a year or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, the Company has operations of crew manning and management and has accounts receivable due from its customers in the shipping industry. Contracts receivable from crew manning in the shipping industry are based on contracted prices. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer, and existing economic conditions. The Company does not have an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2024. Normal contracts receivable is due 30 days after the issuance of the invoice, normally at the month’s end. Receivables past due more than 120 days are considered delinquent and they are included in the provision for doubtful account. There is no interest charged on past due accounts.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The office equipment is depreciated over 3 years.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets acquired are initially recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These assets are being amortized over their useful life of five years.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Income Taxes

 

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606 upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognized from contracts with customers is disclosed separately from other sources of revenue. ASC 606 includes guidance on when revenue should be recognized on a Gross (Principal) or Net (Agent) basis.

 

Most of the Company’s revenues are recognized primarily under long-term contracts, including those for which revenues are based on either a fixed price, or cost-plus-fee basis, and primarily as performance obligations are satisfied. Professional services and other ancillary services are delivered, generally on a monthly basis and are separate and distinct deliverables. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied on a monthly basis when its agency and related services are delivered.

 

6

 

 

The Company has the performance obligation to provide a crew for its customers, the shipping companies, and their ship managers. The Company utilizes its proprietary crew management platform to deliver crew management services to the ship owners. This crew management service is a monthly obligation that starts with the first stage of recruitment, to their transfer of crew to the vessel and continues to monitor the crew during the course of the contract until they disembark.

 

Revenue from crew manning services, agency fees and recruiting fees where Elvictor acts as a principal is recognized as gross revenue. When the company is acting as an agent, revenue is recognized as net revenue in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. Such revenues are from Allotment fees, communication, training fees, covid-19 fees, and other sundry fees. For all fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period. The accounting treatment for the reporting of revenues may vary materially between whether the revenue is reported on a Principal (Gross) or an Agent (Net) basis.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The measurement and recognition of stock - based compensation expense is based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and for non-employee equity transactions as per ASC 718 rules.

 

For transactions in which we obtain certain services of employees, directors, and consultants in exchange for an award of equity instruments, we measure the cost of the services based on the grant date fair value of the award. We recognize the cost over the vesting period.

 

Basic Income/(Loss) Per Share

 

Basic income per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income/(loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of March 31, 2024.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. The FASB issues updates to new accounting pronouncements through the issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

 

Foreign Currency Translation

 

The Company considers the U.S. dollar to be its functional currency as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the time of acquisition or issue. Revenues and expenses are translated at rates approximating the exchange rates in effect at the time of the transactions. All exchange gains and losses are included in operations.

 

Subsequent Events

 

The Company has analyzed the transactions from March 31, 2024, to the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure purposes.

NOTE 3 – RECEIVABLES 

 

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business.

 

Other receivables are mainly for the payments of items such as Home Allotments and Cash Advances to the crews where the Company collects funds from the shipping companies and then facilitates the payments to the crew on their behalf.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has trade accounts receivable of $568,780, Other Receivables of $27,888, and Other Receivables from Related Parties of $333,404.

Organizational Overview

 

Together with our wholly owned crew management subsidiaries, we are a crewing and crew management company responsible for sourcing, recruitment, selection, deployment, scheduling, training, and on-going management of seafarers. Our services also include administrative functions related to crew management services, including payroll services, travel arrangements, and verifying the insurance coverage information of all onboarded seafarers. We benefit from over 65 years of the combined experience of Stavros Galanakis and. Konstantinos Galanakis in various value adding activities of the shipping sector such as ship management, technical management, ship agency, crewing and crew management.

 

Through the crew management platform developed by our affiliate, Seatrix, our personnel are able to collaborate with many different cultures in many different time zones with ever rising complexities, presenting a uniform service level to our principals, regardless of the point of origin of the crew. This innovation allows us to hire junior operators, who after a short training procedure are able to serve our principals with high quality standards, helping Elvictor be cost effective while maintaining the highest possible service level.

 

We currently manage over 2,300 seafarers of ten different nationalities who are aboard seven different ship types.

 

We expanded our services by providing ship management services when we acquired Ultra Shipmanagement from Stavros Galanakis and Konstantinos Galanakis for that purpose, which has received its Det Norske Veritas AS approved Interim Document of Compliance provided under the authority granted by the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and we have also employed specialized personnel. The Interim Document of Compliance is the license required for a ship management company to start providing its services.

Known Trends, Demands, Commitments, Events or Uncertainties Impacting Our Business

 

The shipping industry is currently experiencing historical uncertainty in sustainability logistics and daily operations as a result of the past and/or future COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel Conflict with Hamas, . Additionally, shortages of crew members have also been created due to aging crew members leaving the maritime business. As a result, competition in crew resources is becoming stiffer and more unpredictable resulting in higher wage demands by crew members. These wage demands, accompanied by incentive compensation requested by crew members, are increasing vessel operating expenses. The impact of global inflation has also added to these increases. Additionally, smaller contract durations are requested and timely changes in ports, increasing the costs of changing crews and the costs and volume of such logistics.

 

To address these issues, we are implementing short and long-term strategies based on proactive scheduling and recruitment, with the help of our cloud-based system and intelligent metrics that have been developed in-house to monitor the “trends and fashions” of the maritime industry. Our goal is to build new pools of seafarers by accelerating promotions, cadetship programs, and the employment of more cadets onboard. These cadets are scheduled to be promoted to junior officers in the near future, generating a new breed of officers to address the global shortage and maintain crews at reasonable costs. We have also developed interactive screens through HTML5 links to communicate with seafarers and to keep crews updated, monitor their welfare and provide better services to them. We also proceed to regular updates of our cloud-based system to elevate logistics intelligence, allowing us to handle growth and recruitment volumes more efficiently. While we believe that these actions will help address many of these issues, if we are unable to effectively do so, the shortage of crew members and significant increase in expenses could have a materially adverse impact on our business.

 

COVID-19

 

The future outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which at such time continued to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. The significant outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide; the future outbreak of COVID-19 would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 

The future outbreak of the COVID-19 may adversely affect our shipping industry related customers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

 

The risks associated with any future outbreak of COVID-19 would adversely affect our revenues due to health concerns by patrons of the shipping industry and government restrictions upon the airline and shipping industry. Risks related to a future epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could negatively impact our results of operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including future information that may emerge concerning the severity of such future epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of a future epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Future Operations

 

In order to meet business goals, we must (a) execute efficiently our current business of crew management; and (b) continue to focus on new business development in order to acquire new agreements.

 

In order to raise sufficient funds to implement our business plan, we may have to find alternative sources of funds, from a public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from third parties (such as banks or other institutional lenders). Equity financing could result in additional dilution to then existing shareholders. If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either the money that we raise from private placements, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue to maintain, develop or expand our operations.

 

We generated revenues of $572,709 and $632,251 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 reflecting decreased revenues of $59,542. The $59,542 decrease came as a result of lower crew management and agency fees. We have managed to turn profitable presenting a Net Profit of $77,113 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to a Net Loss of $8,410 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.

 

During the last 12 months, we have undergone material cost-saving efforts to improve its potential profitability and increase its cash flow. For example, our professional fees have decreased from $54,408 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, to $49,812, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 8.5%.

 

Our payroll is a material expense, which we focused on during the last three financial quarters. Recent improvements lead to a decrease of Salaries from $362,941 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, to $250,619 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, representing a decrease of $112,322 or 31.0%.

 

Our goal is to continue improving its profitability over future quarters through targeted cost savings initiatives and revenue enhancement measures. Consistent with our cost savings measures, on May 13, 2024, our Vice President Stavros Galanakis and our Chief Operating & Technology Officer, Christodoulos Tzoutzakis have agreed to reduce their salaries from $5,000 per month to $2,000 per month.

 

Results of Operations

 

Revenues

 

For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, we generated $572,709 and $632,251 in total revenue, respectively, representing a decrease in total revenue of $59,542 between the two periods, or 9.4%. The decrease in total revenue between these two periods is primarily due to a decrease in crew management clients.

Operating Expenses

 

For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, we incurred $372,948 and $504,742, respectively in total operating expenses, representing a decrease in total operating expenses between the two periods of $131,794, or 26.1%. The decrease in operating expenses in 2023 is primarily due to a decrease of $112,322 (31.0%) in salaries, as a result of the cost saving initiatives undertaken by the Company.

 

Net Loss and Gross Profit

 

For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, we incurred a net profit of $77,113, after provision for income taxes, and a net loss of $8,410, after provision for income taxes, respectively, representing an increase in net profit of $85,523 between the two periods. This increase in net profit is attributable to the decreased operating expenses described above.

 

Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital surplus during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 of $132,363 compared to the surplus of $42,454 for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.

 

Cash flows for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023

 

Net cash outflow provided by operating activities was $274,401 for the three-month period ended March 31,2024, compared to an outflow of $39,909 during the same period in 2023. This change was mainly attributable to the cash receivable from our customers and payable to our suppliers.

 

Net cash flow used in investing activities was $4,689, mainly deriving from the purchase of office equipment, and $4,028 for the three-month periods ended March 31,2024 and March 31,2023, respectively.

 

Net cash used for financing activities was $0, for the three-month periods ended March 31,2024 and March 31,2023, respectively.

Cash Requirements

 

We believe our cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We will require additional capital to implement our business development and fund our operations. In the event that our plans or assumptions change, we may need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.

 

Since the commencement of our crew management business, we have funded our operations primarily through equity financings. We expect that we will continue to fund our business through equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. Additional funding may be unavailable on favorable terms, if at all, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results. We intend to continue to fund our business by way of equity or debt financing along with revenues to support us. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership held by our existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.

Outlook

 

The shipping industry and especially the crew management segments will likely continue to face increasing pressures due to the war in Ukraine. According to the International Chamber of Shipping (the “ICS”), which represents approximately 80% of the worlds’ merchant fleet, Ukrainian and Russian seafarers make up 14.5% of the global shipping workforce.

 

Our management team is assessing alternative plans to mitigate potential challenges arising from the ongoing war in Ukraine, among other things.

 

Lack of qualified seafarers has led to increased competition among crewing and shipping companies not only revolving around retaining current crew members, but also involving the strategic challenge of finding and attracting new, qualified seafarers. Traditional recruitment methods may no longer be as effective, and companies will need to invest more resources in recruitment campaigns, including attending job fairs, forming partnerships with maritime academies, and leveraging digital platforms for wider reach. However, this might intensify the financial pressure on crewing companies and lead to thinner profitability margins. Ultimately, this underscores the importance of innovative recruitment and retention strategies in an era of limited seafarer supply.

 

Further to the above, the demand for our services depends on the demand for maritime shipping services which are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy, including the effect of increased inflation. Inflationary pressures may result to important increases to our operating costs that we may not be able to fully transfer to our clients thus affecting our profitability. Additionally, increase in operating costs of our clients may lead to delays in payments for our services and accumulation of bad debt, although we closely monitor their credit behavior to avoid such incidents. Additionally, significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on the demand for our services.

 

The ongoing conflict in Israel may influence the wider macroeconomic environment, but it is unlikely to substantially impact our operations, given that the majority of our seafarers are not from the affected region and none of our clients are based there.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedure

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Framework used by Management to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rule of the SEC, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment and for the reasons described below, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ●    Refer to the upkeep of records which, with reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions;

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of

           management and directors of the

           Company;

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our

           assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements;

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance that any unauthorized cash transactions are detected and prevented; and

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance, that potential erroneous accounting entries are identified and corrected on a timely manner.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 

As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting (as described below).

 

Deficiencies and Significant Deficiencies

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of March 31, 2024, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:

 

     1.   We do not have sufficient written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key

           internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the

           period ended March 31, 2024. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have sufficient written documentation of our

           internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the

           control deficiency that resulted represented a material

           weakness.

 

     2.   We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company’s ability to gather, analyze and

           properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature,

           segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the

           extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed

           by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of

           our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material

           weakness.

 

We have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above and we are in discussions with the risk advisory departments of reputable accounting firms to assist us in the COSO framework documentation and testing of the internal controls. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit, including the employment of new qualified employees.

  

Remediation of Deficiencies and Significant Deficiencies

 

To address these material weaknesses, management engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

 

Additionally, we will continue to establish and implement proper processes and systems to remediate the deficiencies we have had, including preventive controls with the segregation of duties on main areas such as payroll, billing, cash recording, and IT control and detective controls involving account reconciliations on a monthly basis.

 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

 

Risk management and strategy

 

Our Company is committed to continuously assessing cybersecurity risks, including the prevention, detection, and response to unauthorized actions within our information systems that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our data or systems. We are using Layer 7 firewall solutions which monitor all kind of web traffic and any kind of data leaks which may occur as well as a centralized automatic antivirus/antimalware/patch system in order to make sure that all servers and clients hold the latest patches in order to avoid security breaches. The Company has developed its own internal cloud system to avoid dependence on external parties and its email server is hosted on this cloud system therefore is not relying to third party solutions that may have a negative impact on security and reliability of data. The Company’s data are stored daily on high quality magnetic tapes to ensure recovery in case of a serious malfunction. On a monthly basis, all the tapes are being transferred to a fireproof safe location and are replaced with new tapes.

 

As we grow, we plan to refine our cybersecurity strategy in line with global best practices and standards. Importantly, our Board receives regular updates from our Company’s Chief Operating & Technology Officer, Christodoulos Tzoutzakis, regarding potential cybersecurity risks and monitors these risks closely. All potential incidents, regardless of their materiality, are required to be reported immediately to the Board. To date, our proactive risk management has allowed us to navigate cybersecurity challenges without material impairment to our operations or financial condition.

  

Governance

 

Acknowledging the critical importance of cybersecurity, our management and Board are dedicated to maintaining the trust and confidence of our business partners and employees. This includes managing cybersecurity risks as an integral component of our overall risk management framework. While cybersecurity responsibility is shared across all employees, our Board plays a pivotal role in the oversight of our risk management processes, including cybersecurity threats. Our executive officers manage the day-to-day material risks we face, adopting a cross-functional approach to address cybersecurity risks by identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to incidents when they occur.
