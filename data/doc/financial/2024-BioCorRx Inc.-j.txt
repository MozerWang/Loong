This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 

Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “BioCorRx,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this document refer to BioCorRx Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, where appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiaries.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 2024

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1 - BUSINESS

 

BioCorRx Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops and provides addiction treatment solutions offering a unique approach to the treatment of substance use and other related disorders. The Company also controls BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage drug development subsidiary currently seeking FDA approval for BICX104, an implantable naltrexone pellet for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorders. BICX102 is an implantable pellet of naltrexone that was the original product candidate being developed under NIDA award number UG3DA047925 (awarded in 2019 and 2020) and BICX104 is another pellet of naltrexone that subsequently became the lead product candidate with minor excipient differences between the BICX102 and BICX104. On October 31, 2020, the Company entered into a written management services agreement with Joseph DeSanto MD, Inc. (“Medical Corporation”) under which the Company provides management and other administrative services to the Medical Corporation. These services include billing, collection of accounts receivable, accounting, management and human resource functions. Pursuant to the management services agreement, a management fee equal to 65% of the Medical Corporation’s gross collected monthly revenue. Through this arrangement, the Company is directing the activities that most significantly impact the financial results of the respective Medical Corporation; however, all clinical treatment decisions are made solely by licensed healthcare professionals. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary, and, therefore, has consolidated the Medical Corporation as variable interest entity (“VIE”). The medical corporation: (i) had not yet generated any revenues and (ii) had no significant assets or liabilities since inception through March 31, 2024.

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board “FASB” Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” 606. A five-step analysis a must be met as outlined in Topic 606: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

 

The Company has elected the following practical expedients in applying ASC 606:

 

     ·    Unsatisfied Performance Obligations - all performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year.

           The Company has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in ASC 606 and therefore, is not required to disclose the

           aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially

           unsatisfied at the end of the reporting

           period.

           

     ·    Contract Costs - all incremental customer contract acquisition costs are expensed as they are incurred as the amortization

           period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less in

           duration.

           

     ·    Significant Financing Component - the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a

           significant financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity

           transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or

           less.

           

     ·    Sales Tax Exclusion from the Transaction Price - the Company excludes from the measurement of the transaction price all

           taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing

           transaction and collected by the Company from the

           customer.

           

     ·    Shipping and Handling Activities - the Company elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost

           rather than as a separate performance

           obligation.

 

The Company’s net sales are disaggregated by product category. The sales/access fees consist of product sales, which is recognized upon the transfer of promised goods to customers. The project support income is generated from administrative support to Biotechnology research customers, which is recognized upon the transfer of promised services to customers. The distribution rights income consists of the income recognized from the amortization of distribution agreements entered into for its products. The membership/program fees are generated from the Company’s UnCraveRx™ Weight Loss Management Program, which is recognized upon the transfer of promised goods to customers.

Deferred revenue

 

The Company licenses proprietary products and protocols to customers under licensing agreements that allow those customers to access the products and protocols in services they provide to their customers during the term of the license agreement. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from license agreements depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement. Such agreements are reviewed for multiple performance obligations. Performance obligations can include amounts related to initial non-refundable license fees for the use of the Company’s products and protocols and additional royalties on covered services.

 

The Company granted license and sub-license agreements for various regions or States in the United States allowing the licensee to market, distributes and sell solely in the defined license territory, as defined, the products provided by the Company. The agreements are granted for a defined period or perpetual and are effective as long as annual milestones are achieved.

 

Terms for payments for licensee agreements vary from full cash payment to defined terms. In cases where license or sub-license fees are uncollected and deferred; the Company nets those uncollected fees with the deferred revenue for balance sheet presentation.

 

The Company amortizes license fees over the shorter of the economic life of the related contract life or contract terms for each licensee.

 

On October 1, 2019, the Company launched the UnCraveRx™ Weight Loss Management Program. Customers are charged a membership fee and are requested to pay for three training programs at inception. The payments are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.

 

The following table presents the changes in deferred revenue, reflected as current and long term liabilities on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet:

 

Balance as of December 31, 2023

Deferred Revenue-Grant

 

The Company recognizes grant revenues in the period during which the related research and development costs are incurred. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from reimbursement for research and development costs depends upon the specific terms for the contracted work. Such costs are reviewed for multiple performance obligations which can include amounts related to contracted work performed or as milestones have been achieved. 

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the fair value of other equity and debt instruments, income taxes, loss contingencies, and research and development costs.

 

 

                                                                   10

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable are recorded at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing balances. Management estimates the allowance based on collectability of accounts receivable and prior bad debt experience. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance upon management’s determination that such accounts are uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FSAB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326-20-30-2, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, requiring a reporting entity to use a pooled approach to estimate expected credit losses for financial assets with similar risk characteristics. If a financial asset does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets held by the reporting entity, the allowance for credit losses should be determined on an individual basis. Similar risk characteristics for trade receivables may include customer credit rating, trade receivable aging category (e.g., 30-90 days past due), healthcare industry, and other factors that may influence the likelihood of the customer not being able to pay for the goods or services. The Company utilizes this individual approach for its trade receivables as each customer does not share similar risks.

 

Trade receivables with certain customers are financial assets analyzed by the Company under the expected credit loss model. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared risk characteristics (i.e., the relevant healthcare industry) and days past due (i.e., delinquency status), while considering the following if applicable:

 

     ·    Customers in relevant healthcare industries share similar risk characteristics associated with the macroeconomic environment

           of their

           industry.

           

     ·    The expected credit loss rate is likely to increase as receivables move to older aging buckets. The Company used the

           following aging categories to estimate the risk of delinquency status: (i) 0 days past due; (ii) 1-30 days past due; (iii)

           31-60 days past due; (iv) 61-90 days past due; and (v) over 90 days past

           due.

 

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable, grant receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of lease liability and royalty obligation also approximates fair value since these instruments bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.

 

See Note 13 and 14 for stock based compensation and other equity instruments.

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The Company also follows ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.

 

The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or that the Company would have paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities:

 

Level 1:  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market

           in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information

           on an ongoing

           basis.

           

Level 2:  Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar

           assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not

           active.

           

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the

           asset or

           liability.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.

 

 

                                                                   11

Segment Information

 

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic Segment Reporting 280-10 (“ASC 280-10”) establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. ASC 280-10 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance. The information disclosed herein materially represents all of the financial information related to the Company’s principal operating segment.

 

Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company follows a “primary asset” approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

 

 

                                                                   12



Table of Contents

 

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of the assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. No impairments were recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. No impairment was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Software Development Costs

 

The Company has adopted the provision of ASC 985-20-25, Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed, whereby costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold, leased or marketed are research and development costs. Research costs are expensed as incurred; costs of producing product masters incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized; and costs incurred when the product is available for general release to the customers are expensed as incurred. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in added functionality which enables the software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing.

 

On July 1, 2021, the Company began development of a proprietary cloud based app that will be marketed and commercialized, for which $47,980 of costs have been capitalized. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company wrote off the $47,980 as impairment loss.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life of 5 to 15 years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition is reflected in earnings.

 

Leases

 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) and short-term and long-term lease liabilities are included on the face of the consolidated balance sheets.

 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date over the respective lease term in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. For lease agreements with terms less than 12 months, the Company has elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption, and it recognizes such lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Net (loss) Per Share

 

The Company accounts for net loss per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”), which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the statement of operations for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. It excludes the dilutive effects of any potentially issuable common shares. The effect of common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive with respect to losses and therefore basic and dilutive is the same.

 

Diluted net loss per share is calculated by including any potentially dilutive share issuances in the denominator. The following securities are excluded from the calculation of weighted average diluted shares at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. The Company charged to operations $12,618 and $29,148 as advertising costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 

Grant Income

 

On January 17, 2019, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) in support of BICX102/BICX104 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. BICX102 is an implantable pellet of naltrexone that was the original product candidate and BICX104 is another pellet of naltrexone that subsequently became the lead product candidate with minor excipient differences between the BICX102 and BICX104. The grant provides for (i) $2,842,430 in funding during the first year and (ii) $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. On August 27, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse in support of BICX104. The grant provides for $3,453,367 in funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. On March 31, 2022, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for $99,431 in additional funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. Grant payments received prior to the Company’s performance of work required by the terms of the research grant are recorded as deferred income and recognized as grant income once work is performed and qualifying costs are incurred. 

 

On February 22, 2024, the Company’s subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. was awarded a grant of $11,029,977 from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, ("NIDA"). The grant provides the Company with additional resources for the ongoing research of BICX104, a sustained release naltrexone implant for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder. The grant provides for (i) $4,131,123 in funding during the first year, (ii) $3,638,268 during the second-year, and (iii) $3,260,586 during the third-year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds.

Research and development costs

 

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (“ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $213,834 and $237,387 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Stock Based Compensation

 

Share-based compensation issued to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The Company measures the fair value of the share-based compensation issued to non-employees at the grant date using the stock price observed in the trading market (for stock transactions) or the fair value of the award (for non-stock transactions), which were considered to be more reliably determinable measures of fair value than the value of the services being rendered.

 

Income Taxes

 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will not be realized.

 

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.

 

Variable Interest Entity

 

The Company evaluates all interests in the VIE for consolidation. When the Company’s interests are determined to be variable interests, an assessment is made on whether the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, defines the primary beneficiary as the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could be potentially significant. Variable interests are considered in making this determination. Where both of these factors are present, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and the Company consolidates the VIE.

 

Non-Controlling Interest

 

A non-controlling interest should be allocated its share of net income or loss, and its respective share of each component of other comprehensive income, in accordance with ASC 810-10-45-20. Due to a management fee equal to 65% of the Medical Corporation’s gross collected monthly revenue, 65% of the Medical Corporation’s earnings was allocated to the Company, and 35% to the non-controlling interest. Due to the Company’s retaining 75.8% ownership of BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 75.8% of BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s earnings was allocated to the Company, and 24.2% to the non-controlling interest. See accounting policy “Variable Interest Entity” for further information.

Royalty Obligations, net

 

The Company accounted for royalty obligations as debt in accordance with ASC 470-10-25 and derived a debt discount, which is amortized using the straight line method over the expected life of the arrangement, which is 15 years. The Company has no obligation to repay the then outstanding balance if during the expected life of 15 years the treatment is discontinued. In order to record the discount of the liability, the Company fair valued the royalty and the difference between fair value of the royalty obligation and the gross projected future payments was $7,171,200 and was recorded as non-cash interest expense over the life of the liability and offset to additional paid in capital at inception.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company’s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.

 

There are other various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S LIQUIDITY PLANS

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $101,080 and working capital deficit of $7,016,537. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company used net cash in operating activities of $339,668. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues and has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve-month period since the date of the financial statements were issued.

 

The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception has been from proceeds from private placements of convertible and other debt and the sale of common stock. The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.

 

On February 22, 2024, the Company’s subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. was awarded a grant of $11,029,977 from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, ("NIDA"). The grant provides the Company with additional resources for the ongoing research of BICX104, a sustained release naltrexone implant for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder. The grant provides for (i) $4,131,123 in funding during the first year, (ii) $3,638,268 during the second-year, and (iii) $3,260,586 during the third-year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. Government grants are agreements that generally provide cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued several promissory notes to related parties and received total proceeds of $175,880. The promissory notes bear no interest and are due on demand.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued one promissory note to a third party and received total proceeds of $200,000. The promissory note has a stated interest rate of 8% per annum and is due within 9 months.

Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 12 - ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS, NET

 

In March 2019, the Company entered into two Subscription and Royalty Agreements (the “Subscription and Royalty Agreements”). One was with Louis and Carolyn Lucido CRT LLC, managed by Mr. Lucido, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and the other one was with the J and R Galligan Revocable Trust, managed by Mr. Galligan, a holder of between 15% and 20% of the Company’s shares of common stock and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Subscription and Royalty Agreements: (i) each party would purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), in the aggregate amount of $3,000,000 at a purchase price of $15.00 per share (the “Purchase Price”), for a total of 200,000 shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the Company shall pay each (a) a total of $37.50 from the gross revenue derived from each of its weight loss treatments sold in the United States starting on the first (1st) day that the first unit of the treatment is sold (the “Initial Sales Date”) and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Initial Sales Date; and (b) a total of $25.00 from the gross revenue derived from each of its weight loss treatments sold in the United States starting on the day following the third (3rd) anniversary of the Initial Sales Date and ending on the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Initial Sales Date (the “Royalty”).

 

The Company accounted for this transaction as debt in accordance with ASC 470-10-25 and derived a debt discount, which is amortized using the straight line method over the expected life of the arrangement, which is 15 years. The Company has no obligation to repay the then outstanding balance if during the expected life of 15 years the treatment is discontinued. In order to record the discount of the liability, the Company fair valued the royalty and the difference between fair value of the royalty obligation and the gross projected future payments was $7,171,200 and was recorded as non-cash interest expense over the life of the liability and offset to additional paid in capital at inception.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized $118,554 and $115,334 as interest expense.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company approved the grant of 58,625 stock options to two directors valued at $46,088. The term of the options was five years, and the options vested immediately.

 

Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from using the Company’s historical stock prices. The Company accounts for the expected life of options based on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For employees, the Company accounts for the expected life of options in accordance with the “simplified” method, which is used for “plain-vanilla” options, as defined in the accounting standards codification. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the expected term of the options.

Going Concern

 

The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of $(7,016,537), and an accumulated deficit of $79,339,794. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues, and has incurred net losses since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve-month period since the date of the financial statements were issued.

 

The Company believes that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements for the next twelve months since the date of the issuance of the financial statements.

 

The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of its common stock in order to implement the Company’s business plan or by using outside financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these situations in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its operations by additional borrowings and some shareholder advances.

 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment in its securities.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments that management believes are most significant in the application of GAAP used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies, among others, may involve a high degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Further, these estimates and other factors, including those outside of our control could have significant adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Income taxes

 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Loss contingencies

 

Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.

Research and development costs

 

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (“ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. Refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses identified to date include (i) policies and procedures which are not yet adequately documented. We retain a third party with relevant expertise to support us and assist us in enhancing our policies and procedures, (ii) insufficient GAAP experience regarding complex transactions and reporting, and (iii) an insufficient number of staff to maintain optimal segregation of duties and levels of oversight resulting from our small size and testing of the operating effectiveness of the controls. As of March 31, 2024, based on evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

 

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this quarterly report.

 

Changes in Internal Controls

 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

(1)  The Company initiated litigation in 2019 based on a claim that Pellecome and Dr. Orbeck utilized the Company’s confidential

      information to advance their own weight loss

      product.

      

     The Company dismissed this litigation without prejudice in July 2021.

      

     On March 30, 2022, the court entered judgment in favor of Pellecome as an individual defendant whereby the Company was ordered to

      pay Pellecome total costs and attorneys’ fees of $235,886. Pursuant to the judgment, this amount is accruing interest at the rate

      of ten percent (10%) per annum from October 6, 2021 (the date of the original award of attorneys’ fees by the court which was

      followed by a number of filings by each party through February

      2022).

      

     The Company has not yet paid any amount to Pellecome. On May 27, 2022, the Company filed a notice of appeal with California

      Superior Court for Orange County regarding the March 30, 2022 judgment entered in favor of Pellecome. On February 2, 2023, the

      Company filed a motion requesting the California Superior Court for Orange County reverse and remand its prior ruling, including

      reversing the granting of Pellecome $222,933 in attorney’s fees. On October 4, 2023 the Court of Appeal of the State of

      California upheld the March 30, 2022 judgement in favor of Pellecome whereby $222,933 was awarded in attorney’s fees. On January

      5, 2024 the California Superior Court for Orange County entered an amended judgement of $332,503 in favor of Pellecome for costs

      and attorneys’ fees, in addition to the $332,503 judgement the Company owes accrued interest of $57,412. As of March 31, 2024,

      the Company has accrued $322,503 as a loss contingency for this

      matter.
