CORRELATE ENERGY CORP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1 – NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

 

Nature of the Business

 

On June 8, 2023, Correlate Energy Corp. (the “Company” or “CIPI”) filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada pursuant to which it changed its corporate name from Correlate Infrastructure Partners Inc. to Correlate Energy Corp.

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary Correlate, Inc. (“Correlate”), a Delaware corporation.

 

Correlate Energy Corp., together with its subsidiary, is a technology-enabled vertically integrated sales, development, and fulfillment platform focused on distributed clean and resilient energy solutions in North America. 

 

Going Concern

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has not generated positive cash flows from operations. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or achieve profitable operations and positive cash flows. Management’s plans with respect to operations include aggressive marketing, acquisitions, and raising additional capital through sales of equity or debt securities as may be necessary to pursue its business plans and sustain operations until such time as the Company can achieve profitability. Management believes that aggressive marketing combined with acquisitions and additional financing as necessary will result in improved operations and cash flow in 2024 and beyond. However, there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the interim reporting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments (unless otherwise indicated), necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

 

                                                                   7

CORRELATE ENERGY CORP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

The Company maintains its cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The FDIC provides coverage of up to $250,000 per depositor, per financial institution, for the aggregate total of depositors’ interest and non-interest-bearing accounts. The Company’s cash balances may exceed FDIC limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and management does not believe that the Company is exposed to any significant risks.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable consists of invoiced and unpaid sales. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, which is based on an analysis of the Company’s prior collection experience, customer creditworthiness, and current economic trends. Accounts are considered delinquent when payments have not been received within the agreed upon terms and are written off when management determines that collection is not probable. There were no doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Contract Assets

 

The Company’s contracts with customers contain milestone payments which do not coincide with revenue recognition. Accordingly, contract assets consist of earned but unbilled revenues.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

 

Goodwill

 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Management tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

 

Impairment Assessment

 

The Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.

 

The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company uses qualitative and, if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC 350, “Goodwill.”

 

Customer Deposits

 

The Company’s contracts with customers contain milestone payments which do not coincide with revenue recognition. Accordingly, customer deposits consist of customer payments received prior to the performance of contractual obligations.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”

 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in ASC 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. Determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations requires judgment. Contract modifications may occur in the performance of the Company’s contracts. Contracts may be modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.

 

The Company’s revenues are derived from contracts for engineering, procurement and construction services (“EPC”) and consulting. These contracts may have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which may require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. 

 

 

                                                                   8

CORRELATE ENERGY CORP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied as work progresses or at a point in time (for defined milestones). The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided.

 

The Company’s contracts for EPC services are typically less than one year in duration and require us to a) provide engineering services, b) purchase and obtain materials, and c) install equipment and materials to agreed-upon specifications. The EPC agreement typically may be terminated by either party in connection with a breach of the agreement that has not been timely cured, or at any time by either party provided all payments required to be made to the other party have been made, including expense reimbursement and other costs incurred by the non-terminating party in connection with preparing to provide services pursuant to the EPC agreement. The majority of our contracts provide an integrated service to the customer that includes multiple services: origination, design, analyzing, engineering, equipment procurement, construction, and testing services. For revenue recognition, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct, combining separate scopes of work into a single commercial benefit for the customer.  As a result, we typically identify a single performance obligation in our contracts. The Company recognizes revenue using the input method, by obtaining information from its subcontractors every reporting period on the progress of the project and multiplying the percentage completed (calculated based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs) by the estimated total project revenue. 

 

The Company’s contracts for consulting services require us to assist the client in achieving certain defined project milestones. The consulting agreements typically may be terminated by either party in connection with a breach of the agreement that has not been timely cured, or at any time by either party provided all payments required to be made to the other party have been made, including expense reimbursement and other costs incurred by the non-terminating party in connection with preparing to provide services pursuant to the agreement. Revenues are recognized over time as the Company performs the consulting services and value is provided to the client.

 

Financial Instruments

 

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt and are accounted for under the provisions of ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”. The carrying amount of these financial instruments, with the exception of discounted debt, as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.

 

Fair Value Measurement

 

ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement”, requires that certain financial instruments be recognized at their fair values at our condensed consolidated balance sheet dates. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their fair value, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument, along with other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive income. For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under “Financial Instruments.”

 

Nonfinancial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred.

 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;

 

Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or

 

Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

 

 

                                                                   9

The Company did not have any Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities at March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

 

The following is a summary of activity of Level 3 liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2023:

 

Balance - December 31, 2022                                                                                              $     722,328

Change in fair value                                                                                                        (2,487,120)

Balance – March 31, 2023                                                                                                 $   5,357,570 

 

Under the Company’s contract ordering policy, the Company first considers common shares issued and outstanding as well as reserved but unissued equity awards, such as under an equity award program. All remaining equity linked instruments such as, but not limited to, options, warrants, and debt and equity with conversion features are evaluated based on the date of issuance. If the number of shares which may be issued under the Company’s agreements exceed the authorized number of shares or are unable to be determined, equity linked instruments from that date forward are considered to be derivative liabilities until such time as the number of shares which may be issued under the Company’s agreements no longer exceed the authorized number of shares and are able to be determined.

 

Commitments and Contingencies

 

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when management assesses that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

 

Income Taxes

 

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 

In addition, the Company’s management performs an evaluation of all uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s income tax returns to determine whether the income tax positions meet a “more likely than not” standard of being sustained under examination by the applicable taxing authorities. This evaluation is required to be performed for all open tax years, as defined by the various statutes of limitations, for federal and state purposes. If the Company has interest or penalties associated with insufficient taxes paid, such expenses are reported in income tax expense.

 

 

                                                                   10

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share

 

FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”, requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) computations. 

 

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

 

The Company had potential additional dilutive securities outstanding at March 31, 2024 and 2023, as follows.

 

                                                                                                         March 31,       March 31,

During the period ended March 31, 2024, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 3 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Notes Payable

 

From January 29, 2024 to March 29, 2024, the Company and seven holders of notes payable which matured between January 29, 2024 and March 29, 2024, agreed to extend the maturity of the note payables, which had outstanding principal balances totaling $580,000, by six months. The Company accounted for each amendment as an extinguishment of existing debt and issuance of new debt pursuant to ASC 470-50-40. In connection with the amendments, the Company agreed to extend the exercise date of 580,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock, originally issued with the notes payable and set to expire on the maturity date of the notes payable, exercisable at $1.00 per share by approximately three years. The extension of the warrants, which were valued at $906,669, resulted in a discount on the notes totaling $353,271 pursuant to ASC 470-20-30.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, and through May 15, 2024, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

All other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not expected to have any impact once adopted.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $101,665, as compared to a cash balance of $1,412,379 at December 31, 2023. The Company reported cash flows used in operating activities of $1,276,015 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1,089,233 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $186,782 increase in cash flows used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily driven by increases in compensation related expenses, including stock-based compensation as well as professional fees for consultants related to the Company’s planned operational expansion.  The Company reported cash flows used in investing activities of $34,699 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and had no investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cash used for investing activities in 2024 was related to the purchase of property and equipment. The Company had no cash flows from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Cash flows from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023, of $1,734,330 were the result of $1,804,950 in proceeds from loan agreements and $70,620 in repayments of loan agreements. 

 

Our ability to successfully execute our business plan is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing and/or upon realizing revenues sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses. Until we are able to sustain our ongoing operations through revenues, we intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

 

On April 10, 2024, the Company received funding from a Bridge Loan and Security Agreement (“Agreement”) entered into with Clearview Funding Group LLC (“Lender”) on March 26, 2024.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $800,000 from the Lender and is required to repay to Lender a total of $1,080,000 (“Repayment Amount”). The Repayment Amount will be made to Lender over a period of forty-eight (48) weeks on a weekly basis.  The Company shall pay $7,375 per week during the first twelve weeks and $27,375 per week for the next thirty-six weeks.  In connection with the Agreement, the Company has granted a security interest to Lender in certain of the Company’s assets, subject to prior security interests as more fully described in the Agreement, as collateral for the repayment of the Repayment Amount. The Company may prepay the then outstanding Repayment Amount at any time, however, if the Company seeks to repay the Repayment Amount within 120 days from April 10, 2024 the Lender has agreed to provide the Company an early prepayment discount.  In connection with the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 100,000 shares of its common stock to the Lender as a commitment fee. The proceeds received from this Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes.

 

The Company expects to raise significant debt or equity capital in order to fund expanding operations in the near future.

 

Results of Operations

 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s revenues were $432,799 and $50,734, respectively. The source of revenues which increased in 2024 compared to the prior year period was from engineering, procurement and construction services (“EPC”) and consulting services performed for solar energy projects. The increase of $382,065 or 753%, was driven primarily by the continued expansion of operations during the current period. We anticipate the Company’s revenues in upcoming quarters to continue to grow as revenues are recognized from projects in progress and in the pipeline. 

 

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, totaled $51,577 compared to gross profit of $4,875 in the comparable prior year period. The $46,702 increase in gross profit was due to the Company’s increased operations, growth plans and focused efforts to maximize profitability by effectively managing installation and equipment costs. We anticipate future gross margins to increase from the current level as we commercialize new project opportunities, increase revenues and cover more fixed costs within cost of revenues and expand project profitability.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, operating expenses were $3,032,975 compared to $1,208,148 in the comparable prior year period. The increase of $1,824,827, or 151%, was primarily driven by increases in stock-based compensation expenses of $1,192,205, payroll and related expenses of $420,361 (included in general and administrative expenses) and consulting fees of $156,472 (included in legal and professional expenses). These increases were the result of the addition of strategic management as well as both internal and outsourced staff to support our continued expansion efforts. We anticipate future operating expenses to increase with the expansion of operations, resulting in increased expenses related to wages and compensation, advertising, and insurance partially offset by added contribution margins from anticipated revenue growth.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, other expenses totaled $1,495,044, compared to $2,207,080 in the comparable prior year period. The decrease in other expenses was primarily driven by no financing costs in 2024 compared to $3,808,565 in 2023, partially offset by $2,487,120 related to the change in fair value of a derivative liability in 2023 and increases of $469,063 in the amortization of debt discount and $140,346 in interest expense incurred during the period in 2024. We anticipate other expenses to continue to be driven by these factors on a comparable basis throughout 2024.

 

The activities above resulted in net losses of $4,476,442 and $3,410,353 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

 

Our disclosure controls and procedures provide our management with reasonable assurances that our disclosure controls and procedures will achieve their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting can or will prevent all human error. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are internal resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be weighed relative to their corresponding costs. Because of the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide complete assurance that all control issues and instances of error, if any, within our company are detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur due to human error or mistake. Additionally, controls, no matter how well designed, could be circumvented by the individual acts of specific persons within the organization. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all potential future conditions.
