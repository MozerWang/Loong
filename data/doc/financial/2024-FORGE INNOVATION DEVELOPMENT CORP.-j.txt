Forge Innovation Development Corp. and Subsidiary

 

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

 

Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business

 

Forge Innovation Development Corp. (individually “Forge” and collectively with its subsidiary, the “Company”), was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016 under the name of You-Go Enterprises, LLC (the “Company Predecessor”). On November 3, 2016, Forge amended its Articles of Incorporation in the State of Nevada to change the Company Predecessor’s name to Forge Innovation Development Corp. Our current principle executive office is located at 6280 Mission Blvd Unit 205, Jurupa Valley, CA 92509. The Company’s main business focuses on real estate development, land purchasing and selling and property management. The Company’s common stock is currently traded on OTCQB under the symbol “FGNV”.

 

On August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of March 31, 2024, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary due to our business strategy adjustment.

 

On March 24, 2023, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the “Company” or the “Buyer”) and Legend Investment Management, LLC (“Legend LLC” or the “Seller”), the Company acquired 77.3% of Legend LLC’s 66% ownership of Legend International Investment, LP (“Legend LP”). Legend LP owns 100% of Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the “Property”) located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated on a 4.51acre site.

 

A relative of the President of the Company has significant influence of the Seller’s management, therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51% interest of Legend LP from Legend LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common stocks of the Company, valued at $0.70 per share for a total purchase price of $1,377,000, which equals 51% of Legend LP’s approximate net value of $2,700,000 based on (1) the Property’s valuation appraisal report dated on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP’s net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party lender effective on March 23, 2023. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51% of Legend LP and the Seller will own 15% of Legend LP.

 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

                                                                   6

 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach, which applies the new standard to contracts that are not completed as of the date of adoption. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services.

 

Revenue streams that are scoped into ASU 2014-09 include:

 

Property management services

 

The Company deals directly with prospects and tenants for the owners of properties, which mainly includes marketing property, collecting rent, handling maintenance, repairing issues and responding to tenant complaints. The Company recognizes revenue as earned on a monthly basis and has concluded this is appropriate under the new standard.

 

Rental income

 

The Company’s rental income, which is derived primarily from lease contracts through Legend LP, includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the lease. The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. In addition to base rent, the Company’s lease agreements generally require tenants to pay or reimburse the Company for all property operating expenses, which primarily reflect insurance costs and real estate taxes incurred by the Company and subsequently reimbursed by the tenant. However, some limited property operating expenses that are not the responsibility of the tenant are absorbed by the Company. Under ASC 842, the Company has elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line “Revenue from tenants.” For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, the Company has reflected them on a net basis.

 

If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on several factors including, but not limited to:

 

● whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent.

● whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term.

● whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and

● whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.

 

Pursuant to the lease agreements, the Company receives security deposits which will be refunded or applied as final payments as outlined in the agreements. Such security deposits are recorded as liabilities for the Company on the consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, security deposits totaled $151,893.

 

Real estate investments, net

 

Land, building, and improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major replacements and betterments, capital improvements and tenant improvements activities, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Buildings and improvements that are under redevelopment, or are being developed, are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. Additionally, amounts essential to the development of the property, such as pre-construction, development, construction, interest and other costs incurred during the period of development are capitalized. The Company ceases capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in any event no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. Depreciation and amortization are provided primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial statement purposes and by accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Estimated useful lives for financial statement purposes are as follows:

 Schedule of Estimated Useful Lives

          Building Computer equipment and software                                                                39 years

          Building improvements                                                                                   10 years

          Equipment, furniture and fixtures                                                                      5-7 years

 

Land is not depreciated because land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.

 

Business Combination

 

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities over the fair value of purchase consideration is recorded as gain on bargain purchase included in other income on the consolidated statement of operations.

Non-controlling Interests

 

Non-controlling interests are portions of entities included in the condensed consolidated financial statements that are not attributable to the Company. Non-controlling interests are identified separately from the Company’s stockholders’ equity and its net income (loss). Non-controlling interest equity balances include the non-controlling entity’s initial contribution at the date of the original acquisition, on-going contributions, distributions, and percentage share of earnings since inception. The non-controlling interests are calculated based on percentages of ownership.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements.

 

Income Tax Disclosures - In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released ASU No. 2023-09, titled “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Enhancements to Income Tax Disclosures” (referred to as “ASU 2023-09”). This new standard mandates the disclosure, on an annual basis, of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and the disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 becomes effective for annual reporting periods starting after December 15, 2025. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this standard will not significantly impact its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released ASU 2023-07, titled “Enhancements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). This standard necessitates companies to provide additional, more comprehensive details regarding significant expenses of a reportable segment, even if there is only one such segment. Its purpose is to enhance disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods starting after December 15, 2024, with the option for early adoption. We are presently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on our consolidated financial statements.

 

The management does not believe that other than disclosed above, the recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows.

 

Note 3 - Going Concern

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in the normal course of business. However, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $3,070,272 as of March 31, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

In view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to the Company and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management believes that the Company’s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However, management cannot provide assurance that the Company will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation.

 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of Forge Innovation Development Corp. to continue as a going concern.

 

                                                                   8

Note 11 –Subsequent Event

 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and noted the subsequent event below:

 

On April 15, 2024, Legend LP refinanced its property by securing a new promissory note (the “New Note”) in the totaling $5,000,000 from GBC International Bank (“GBC”). The initial interest rate of this New Note stands at 7.375%, determined based on the “Wall Street Journal Prime Rate” (the “Prime Rate”). The Prime Rate is the interest rate published each business day in the money rates section of the Wall Street Journal, currently set at 8.50%, with an additional margin of -1.125 percent points applied, resulting in an initial interest rate of 7.375% of our New Note. The interest rate of the New Note will be using a variable interest rate based on the Prime Rate plus a margin of -1.125 parentage points. However, the interest rate will not fall below 5% throughout the duration of the New Note. The New Note between Legend LP and GBC was completed on April 15, 2024, with the maturity date set for April 5, 2034.

 

                                                                   12

 

 

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operation

 

This 10−Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.

 

Overview

 

Forge Innovation Development Corp. is a development stage company and was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. The Company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own, and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres in the city of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than getting involved in protracted negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.

 

On August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of March 31, 2024, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary due to our business strategy adjustment.

 

On March 24, 2023, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the “Company” or the “Buyer”) and Legend Investment Management, LLC (“Legend LLC” or the “Seller”), the Company acquired 77.3% of Legend LLC’s 66% ownership of Legend International Investment, LP (“Legend LP”). Legend LP owns 100% of Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the “Property”) located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated on a 4.51acre site.

 

A relative of the President of the Company has significant influence of the Seller’s management, therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51% interest of Legend LP from Legend LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common stocks of the Company, valued at $0.70 per share for a total purchase price of $1,377,000, which equals 51% of Legend LP’s approximate net value of $2,700,000 based on (1) the Property’s valuation appraisal report dated on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP’s net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party lender effective on March 23, 2023. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51% of Legend LP and the Seller will own 15% of Legend LP.

 

Results of Operation for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had total revenue of $136,219, as compared to $45,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $91,219, or 203%. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP in March 2023.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had property management income of $nil, as compared to $45,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $45,000. The decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP in 2023, which eliminated to recognize property management income from Legend LP as intercompany transaction for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had total rent income generated by Legend LP of $136,219, as compared to $nil during the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $136,219, or 100%. The increase was mainly resulted from the acquisition of Legend LP near the end of the first quarter in 2023.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $66,090 and $36,311, respectively. During the same period of 2023 and 2024, the depreciation expense increased from $6,213 to $78,361, and property operating expense increased from $nil to $36,148. The increases in expenses are mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP, which leads more depreciation expenses and property operating related expenses.

 

                                                                   13

 

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had interest expense, net of $131,014 and $nil occurred from the loans of Legend LP, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had gain on bargain purchase of $487,688 and $nil on the acquisition of Legend LP, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had share-based compensation of $494,028 and $nil, respectively. The increase is due to the adoption of 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of common stocks under the plan to the Company’s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan after the first quarter of 2023.

 

Equity and Capital Resources

 

We have incurred losses since inception of our business in 2016, except for current quarter, and as of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,070,272. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash of $3,909 and a negative working capital of $1,033,264, compared to cash of $4,892 and a negative working capital of $482,138 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the working capital deficiency was primarily due to cash used to pay for operating expenses and loans and interest of Legend.

 

Going Concern Assessment

 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated deficit and other adverse key financial ratios.

 

Management’s plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations and execute the business plan of the Company in order to meet its operating needs on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund the Company’s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements.

 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 

The critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.
