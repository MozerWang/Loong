Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our assumptions about financial performance; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the agriculture technology industry, all of which were subject to various risks and uncertainties.

 

When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”), in our press releases, in our periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “may,” “will,” “expects,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. However, any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. We caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors.

 

We do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this annual report. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. has identified important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.

 

                                                                   3

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited)

(Expressed in US Dollars, except where noted)

 

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PREPARATION

 

Business Overview

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and related financial information of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and SEC for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.

 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments which are necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and cash flows during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future period.

 

Liquidity and Management’s Plan

 

The Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $3.3 million, $1.3 million of net cash used in operating activities, and the Company had a working capital deficit of $0.7 million.

 

                                                                   8

 

 

The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The interim financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the development stage of its business plan. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For the next twelve months from issuance of these interim financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to our currently outstanding common shares. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these interim financial statements.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On October 11, 2023, the Company executed a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares (the “Reverse Split”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every 50 shares of the Company’s old common shares were converted into one share of the Company’s new common shares. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common shares, as well as convertible debentures, convertible features, prefunded warrants, stock options and warrants outstanding at the time of the date of the Reverse Split. The exercise price on outstanding equity based-grants was proportionately increased, while the number of shares available under the Company’s equity-based plans was proportionately reduced. Share and per share data (except par value) for the periods presented reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. References to numbers of common shares and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto for periods ended prior to October 11, 2023 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.

 

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

 

In November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” ASU 2023-07 provides guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires companies to provide enhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional information for reconciling items. The standard also requires companies to disaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.

 

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

 

                                                                   9

 

 

Inventories

 

Inventories consist of finished goods of milled flour and related packaging material recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost measured using the average cost method. Inventories includes all costs that relate to bringing the inventory to its present condition and location under normal operating conditions.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Product revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023 was limited to sales from hydroxyl generators and will expand to include sales of our UN(THINK) Foods products in 2024. We recognize product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products or services to customers. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer, which is at the point of shipment or delivery of the goods.

 

Convertible Instruments

 

The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which provides that if three criteria are met, the Company is required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which;

 

(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;

(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and

(c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.

 

ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument.”. Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. ASC 815 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control or could require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.

 

Foreign Currency Transactions

 

The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the local currencies are translated into USD for consolidation as follows: assets and liabilities at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity at the historical rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ accounts are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” as equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the reporting currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included within non-operating expenses.

 

Definite Lived Intangible Asset

 

Definite lived intangible asset consists of a granted patent. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The estimated useful life of the granted patent is 20 years and the patent was available for use starting January 2023.

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“asset group”). An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The reversal of impairment losses is prohibited.

 

Loss per Share

 

The Company presents basic and diluted loss per share data for its common shares. Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The number of common shares used in the loss per shares calculation includes all outstanding common shares plus all common shares issuable for which there are no conditions to issue other than time. Diluted loss per common share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, such as stock options and warrants and assumes the receipt of proceeds upon exercise of the dilutive securities to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased at the average market price during the year.

 

                                                                   10

 

 

Fair Value Accounting

 

The fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturities of these items.

 

As part of the issuance of debentures on June 30, 2022, January 17, 2023, October 18, 2023 and November 30, 2023 as well as the private placement on June 20, 2023, the Company issued warrants having strike price denominated in USD. This creates an obligation to issue shares for a price that is not denominated in the Company’s functional currency and renders the warrants not indexed to the Company’s stock, and therefore, must be classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. On the same basis, the Series A Warrants and the representative warrants issued as part of the IPO are also classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value.

 

The fair value of the Company’s warrants is determined in accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the assumptions (inputs) to valuation techniques used to price assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:

 

●    Level 1: Defined as observable inputs, such as quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

      

●    Level 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets

      or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,

      or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the

      assets or liabilities.

      

      

●    Level 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that

      are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those

      whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation

      techniques, as well as significant management judgment or

      estimation.

 

Reclassifications

 

The Company has reclassified certain share base payment expenses from Wages and salaries to Share based compensation in the 2023 consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to align with the 2024 presentation.

As at March 31, 2024, the Company had $nil (December 31, 2023 – $38,857) in finished goods.

 

5. INTANGIBLE ASSET

 

Intangible asset represents $12,265,856 (December 31, 2023 - $12,733,885) for intellectual property (“Manna IP”) acquired under an asset purchase agreement with Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”) dated September 10, 2021. The Manna IP encompasses patented technologies to naturally process and convert grains, pulses, and root vegetables, into low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour products, as well as a wide range of breakfast cereals, juices, natural sweeteners, and baking enhancers. The Company paid $1,475,000 in cash and issued 147,600 prefunded warrants valued at $12,106,677 (the “Purchase Price”). Subject to a 9.99% stopper and SEC Rule 144 restrictions, the prefunded warrants will vest in tranches up until March 10, 2024 (all tranches have fully vested). When vested the tranches of prefunded warrants are convertible into an equal number of common shares.

 

On January 3, 2023, Manna satisfied all of its contractual obligations when the patent was approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office and the title was transferred to the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 141,175 shares in relation to this transaction. As at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 6,425 unconverted prefunded warrants outstanding.

 

Based on the terms above and in conformity with US GAAP, the Company accounted for purchase as an asset acquisition. The asset was available for use on January 3, 2023. The asset has a useful life of 20 years. The Company recorded $164,295 in amortization expense related to the Manna IP for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023 - $163,750).

 

The estimated annual amortization expense for the next five years are as follows:

6. INVESTMENT

 

On June 18, 2023, the Company signed a memorandum of understanding with Radical Clean Solutions Ltd. (“RCS”) to purchase common shares issued by RCS. The Company paid RCS $225,000 for 14% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. Under the terms of the MOU, the use of proceeds is exclusively for the advance purchase of hydroxyls generating devices for commercial sales into controlled environment agriculture, food manufacturing, warehousing and transportation verticals. The Company will receive one of five board of director seats of RCS and has a right of first refusal to maintain an ownership percentage in RCS of not less than 10% of the total issued and outstanding common shares. On October 1, 2023 the Company and RCS signed a definitive agreement to convert the advance into a 14% ownership investment in RCS.

 

As at March 31, 2024, the carrying value of the investment in RCS was $218,449 (December 31, 2023 - $223,801) adjusted for foreign exchange differences of $6,551. As at March 31, 2024, the Company assessed the investment for the presence of the following impairment indications:

 

●    A significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee

      

●    A significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee

      

●    A significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee

      operates

      

●    A bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar investment

      for an amount less than the carrying amount of that

      investment

      

●    Factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows

      from operations, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt

      covenants.

 

None of the above qualitative factors demonstrating potential impairment were present.

The transaction costs incurred in relation to first tranche were $1,634,894. The Debentures are senior to all other indebtedness or claims in right of payment, other than indebtedness secured by purchase money security interested.

The transaction costs incurred in relation to second tranche were $325,962.

 

On June 26, 2023, the Company entered into waiver and amendment agreements (“Debenture Modification Agreements”) with the Investors to modify terms of the Purchase Agreements. The Debenture Modification Agreements provide as follows:

     2.   The Conversion Price has been reduced to the lower of $22.50 or the price of subsequent dilutive issuances under the

           Company’s ATM

           program.

     3.   100% of ATM proceeds up to $1 million USD may be kept by Company, while any dollar amount over this threshold will be

           distributed 33% to the Company and 67% to the

           Investors.

     4.   The minimum tranche value for Additional Closings has been reduced from $5.0 million to $2.5 million.

     5.   The Investors have each agreed to raise no objection to one or more private placements of securities by the Company with an

           aggregate purchase price of up to $1,000,000 at a purchase price of at least $12.50 per common share and two-year warrant

           (with a per share exercise price of $25.00, and no registration

           rights).

     6.   The Company may not prepay any portion of the principal amount of this Debenture without the prior written consent of the

           Investor; However the Company must apply the approved or percentage of approved gross proceeds from the sale of its Common

           Stock from an at-the-market offering to prepay this Debenture (pro-rated among all Debentures) and shall be permitted to

           prepay the Debentures notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Debenture or the Purchase

           Agreement.

 

On August 9, 2023, the Company entered into another waiver and amendment agreement (“Agreement”) with the Investors with respect to a certain Senior Convertible Debenture (the “Debentures”) due July 17, 2025 issued by the Company to that Investor. The Agreement provides as follows:

 

     1.   The Company wishes to make Monthly Redemptions in shares of the Company’s Common Stock in lieu of cash payments, until

           further written notice from the Company to the

           Purchaser.

     2.   The Purchaser is willing to accept such shares as payment of the Monthly Redemption Amount provided that the Equity

           Conditions are met; and will consider on a case-by-case basis accepting payments in shares of Common Stock if the Equity

           Conditions are not met, at its sole discretion. The Company may inquire of the Purchaser at least five (5) Trading Days

           prior to a Monthly Redemption Date whether the Purchaser is willing to accept Shares without the Equity Conditions having

           been met. An email reply from the Purchaser shall be sufficient evidence of such monthly

           waiver.

     3.   The Purchaser will accept the August 1, 2023 Monthly Redemption Amount in shares of Common Stock valued at the August 1

           Repayment Price for such

           date.

Contingencies

 

Litigation

 

On August 11, 2023, AgriFORCE’s former CEO, Ingo Wilhelm Mueller filed a Notice of Civil Claim in which he alleges that AgriFORCE wrongfully terminated his employment without notice, in breach of the parties’ underlying employment agreement. Mr. Mueller alleges to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of base salary of $473,367 CAD per annum and damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $468,313 CAD. AgriFORCE’s position is that Mr. Mueller was terminated for ‘just cause’ because he breached his fiduciary duty to act in AgriFORCE’s best interest by, among other things, submitting a sizeable bid for the acquisition of a company without first obtaining Board approval. In doing so, Mr. Mueller misrepresented AgriFORCE’s financial standing and forged, or instructed others to forge, a document by affixing the electronic signature of AgriFORCE’s CFO.

 

As at December 31, 2023, the parties were in the discovery stage of litigation. AgriFORCE has produced relevant documents to Mr. Mueller, and is awaiting Mr. Mueller’s production of relevant documents. The parties are also in the process of scheduling examinations for discovery. Management is instructing counsel to advance the matter given the relative strength of AgriFORCE’s case.

 

The likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is relatively low given the facts supporting AgriFORCE’s ‘for cause’ termination of Mr. Mueller as well as the significant expense that Mr. Mueller would have to incur to advance this matter to trial.

 

On September 31, 2023, Stronghold filed a Complaint with the Superior Court of California for Breach of Contract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and Common Count: Goods and Services Rendered in relation to the purchase and sale agreement for the Coachella property. Stronghold alleges that AgriFORCE breached the PSA by failing to deposit certain stocks certificates into Escrow, failing to pay amounts owed for its costs incurred in connection with the Sellers Work, and for terminating the PSA despite Stronghold’s performance of the Sellers Work. Stronghold is claiming $451,684 plus interest in damages based on invoices it provided. AgriFORCE will dispute, among other things, the amount and invoices, estimating approximately $230,000 as Stronghold’s true expenses that may be claimed. The Company filed their answer on February 26, 2024. The trial date has not been set for this case.

 

On March 27, 2024, BV Peeters Advocaten-Avocats (“Peeters”) summoned the Company to appear on May 31, 2024 at the First Chamber of the Dutch-Speaking Division of the Business Court in Brussels. Peeters is seeking payment for €467,249 of unpaid bills for legal services plus penalties and interest. The Company believes that Peeters performed actions that were not in the Company’s best interest. The Company does not intend to pay the outstanding legal bills and intends to vigorously defend its position in court.

Company History and Our Business

 

Overview

 

AgriFORCE™ was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1C6.

 

Our Business

 

AgriFORCE™ is an “Ag-Tech” company with a primary focus to developing and utilizing our intellectual property assets for improvements dedicated to the agricultural industry. We believe that this goal is best achieved by using our proprietary IP for solutions in the agricultural industry as well as seeking development of new IP to both enhance the technology which we already retain in house as well as development of new technologies which can increase our footprint in the Ag-Tech space with expansion into other areas which have ESG ramifications.

 

Our AgriFORCE™ Brands division is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver more nutritious food. We will market and commercialize ingredient supplies, like our Awakened Flour™ and Awakened Grains ™.

 

The AgriFORCE™ Solutions division is dedicated to transforming modern agriculture through our controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) equipment, including our FORCEGH+™” solution. We are continuing to modify our business plan to accommodate artificial intelligence and blockchain in the development and implementation of FinTech systems to commercial farmers, and advancing on the commercialization of our Hydroxyl clean room systems to greatly reduce the spread of pathogens, mold and disease at processing facilities worldwide.

 

AgriFORCE™ Brands

 

UN(THINK)™ Foods

 

The Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The IP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as well as produces a natural sweetener juice. The core process is covered under Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is designed to unlock nutritional properties, flavors, and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized all-natural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional, performance and culinary applications.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has achieved milestones towards the commercialization of our UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™ flour, the Company’s first line of products to utilize the IP. Management has defined and tested its quality controls and safety protocols for production, and produced several multi-ton batches of germinated grains, refining and scaling production processes with our partners in Canada. We are also in the process of qualifying partners in the US to establish additional production hubs – at no additional CAPEX - which will support growth and reduce logistics costs for customers in the region. Additionally, we have established our supply chain logistics with a contracted shipping company and two warehouses in Canada and the US. Our commercial team made progress in defining pricing and is starting to approach US and Canadian Bakeries and Baked Goods Companies who are now testing our new flours for integration into their manufacturing operations and innovation pipeline. Online sales logistics and advertising materials were developed during the period to support the establishment of the direct-to-consumer sales channel which will be started once the Business to Business channel sales will ramp up. Lastly, the Company has developed an extensive number of recipes for the application of Awakened Flour™ product line for both customers and consumers.

 

The Company is developing several finished product prototypes including a line of pancake mixes, which are ready for consumer testing.

 

Wheat and Flour Market

 

Modern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are low in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by triggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (~ 9%), and very high in starch (~ 75%)(4). Apart from dietary fiber, whole flour is only marginally better in terms of these macronutrients (5).

 

(4) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.

In contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism(6). They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes(7).

Understanding Our Approach –Bringing Cutting Edge Technology to Enhance and Modernize Agriculture

 

Traditional farming includes three fundamental approaches: outdoor, greenhouse and indoor. We are taking modern technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and blockchain–based advances to bring what is traditionally a low technology industry into the 21st century. This approach means that we are able to reach into areas not readily available to agricultural businesses in the past, such as advanced Fintech to enhance financing capabilities for these businesses and more readily provide advanced intelligence for farmers. These technologies can also be applied to worldwide sourcing and matching food producers to consumers in an efficient manner.

 

Our intellectual property combines a patented uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to solve excessive water loss and high energy consumption, two problems plaguing nearly all controlled environment agriculture systems. FORCEGH+ delivers a patented clean, sealed, self-contained micro-environment that maximizes natural sunlight and offers supplemental LED lighting. It limits human intervention and is designed to provide superior quality control through AI optical technology. It was also created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, conserving water, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop yields.

 

                                                                   21

 

 

The Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are leading innovation moving forward. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech solutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint.

 

The Company intends to continue development and license its technology to existing farmers in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets using its unique patented facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable farmers to effectively grow crops in a sealed controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). The Company has designed FORCEGH+™ facilities to produce crops in virtually any environmental condition and to optimize crop yields to as near their full genetic potential possible while substantially eliminating the need for the use of pesticides, fungicides and/or irradiation. The Company continues to develop its solution for fruits and vegetables focusing on the integration of its current structure with a new form of vertical grow technology.

 

BUSINESS PLAN

 

The Company will launch a full line up of Hydroxyl Devices and start commercializing the Hydroxyl Devises into the US market of CEA and Food Manufacturing. The Company will identify and establish exclusive distribution agreement for the EMEA region as well Expand Distribution Network into Latin America and Asia. The Company will also advance on the commercialization of our Hydroxyl clean room systems to greatly reduce the spread of pathogens, mold and disease at processing facilities worldwide.

 

The Company is exploring opportunities to utilize its patented FORCEGH+™ structure and its related technologies in joint ventures and licensing. The Company is also studying the utilization of FORCEGH+ technologies in arctic, tropical and desert environments. The Company intends to continue development of and license of its technology to existing farmers in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets using its unique patented facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable farmers to effectively grow crops in a sealed controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”).

 

The Company also looks to expand its efforts into development of blockchain solutions and the implementation of these solutions into FinTech systems to allow quicker and less costly transactions between commercial farmers.

Merger and Acquisition (“M&A”)

 

The Company plans to evaluate accretive M&A opportunities of an appropriate scale as it progresses with its ongoing business plans surrounding its already owned IP and improvements thereto. Any M&A propositions must be of a size and scale which works to complement the Company’s ongoing business in terms of allocation of resources.

 

The Company intends to focus any M& A activity to targets which are focused in the Ag-Tech space with emphasis on businesses which can also increase our ESG footprint. This refocused M&A strategy will ensure that proper personnel and economic resources are allocated to the Company’s ongoing businesses, while refocusing efforts on synergistic opportunities which work to enhance the Company’s existing assets.

 

As a result of this refocus of the M&A strategy, the following formerly considered acquisition opportunities are no longer being considered by the Company:

 

Delphy Groep BV Acquisition

 

     ●    On February 10, 2022, the Company signed a definitive share purchase agreement (the “Delphy Agreement”) to acquire Delphy, a

           Netherlands-based Ag-Tech consultancy firm, for €23.5 million through a combination of cash and stock.

           

     ●    On May 25, 2023, the parties mutually terminated the share purchase agreement after extensive due diligence, an evaluation

           of the historical and projected financial information, potential for impairment risk as well as current market

           conditions.

 

Deroose Plants NV Binding Letter of Intent

 

     ●    On February 23, 2022, the Company signed a binding letter of intent (the “Deroose LOI”) with Deroose Plants NV (“Deroose”). 

     ●    The Deroose LOI was subject to completion of standard due diligence and entry into a definitive purchase agreement. 

     ●    The Company is no longer pursuing this acquisition opportunity.

 

                                                                   23

 

 

Stronghold Land Acquisition

 

     ●    On August 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with Stronghold Power Systems, Inc.

           (“Stronghold”) to purchase approximately 34 acres of land in Coachella California.

           

     ●    As at March 31, 2023 the prefunded warrants issued were rescinded and the warrants were rendered null and void as the

           Company presented termination notice to

           Stronghold.

     ●    On October 12, 2023, the Company was served a complaint filed in the Superior Court of California from Stronghold for breach

           of contract in relation to the PSA. The Company denies any liability, other than what is already recorded in the financial

           statements and will vigorously defend the claims made against the

           Company.

 

Berry People LLC Binding Letter of Intent

 

     ●    On January 24, 2023 the Company announced it has entered a binding letter of intent (“BP LOI”) to acquire Berry People LLC,

           (“Berry

           People”).

     ●    The Company is no longer pursuing this acquisition opportunity.

 

Recent Developments

 

Management Restructuring

 

On January 25, 2024, Troy McClellan, President of AgriFORCE Solutions, submitted a letter of resignation to the Company. On January 25, 2024, the Company accepted his resignation and deemed it effective immediately pursuant to Section 7.3 of his employment agreement with the Company which permits waiver by the Company of Mr. McClellan’s notice period (through March 31, 2024) and corresponding acceleration of the resignation date.

 

On February 10, 2024, Richard Wong resumed his original role as Chief Financial Officer in order to focus on finance and accounting matters for the Company. Effective as of the same day, Jolie Kahn was appointed Executive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. Jolie Kahn shall report to David Welch, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, who shall act as Executive Chairman until such time as a permanent Chief Executive Officer is appointed.

 

On February 19, 2024, Margaret Honey resigned as a Director of (the “Company”) to pursue other interests. The resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company.

 

Status as an Emerging Growth Company

 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies.

 

                                                                   24

 

 

We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (a) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the initial public offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (c) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.

 

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023

 

Results of Operations

 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited financial statements for the interim periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this report.

 

Revenues

 

The Company sells its products directly to customers and indirectly to customers through sales brokers.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no revenue.

  

Operating Expenses

 

Operating expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, professional fees, consulting, office and administration, investor and public relations, research and development, and share-based compensation. Operating expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to March 31, 2023 by $1,474,934 or 52% primarily due to the following:

 

●    Professional fees and consulting decreased by $116,974 and $106,200, respectively due to a significant decrease in M&A spending

      during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as a result of the Company focusing on organic growth of currently active

      ventures.

●    Research and development decreased by $32,538 due to limited research services procured during 2024 as compared to expenditures

      for UN(THINK) product development during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

      

●    Investor and public relations expenses decreased by $242,638 due to more investor and public relations advisory services utilized

      in 2023 for Company campaigns and

      communication.

●    Wages and salaries decreased by $526,930 due to a reduction in staff head count (number of employees reduced from 15 during the

      three months ended March 31, 2023 to 7 during the three months ended March,

      2024).

●    Office and administrative decreased by $40,559 due to overall cost cutting initiatives for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

●    Travel and entertainment decreased by $67,961 due to a reduction in travel for foreign business development.

●    Sales and marketing decreased by $75,350 due to significant reductions in public relations agency work and social media contracted

      fees from cost cutting

      initiatives.

●    Share based compensation decreased $256,151 due to a significant number of option forfeitures from lower staff head count.  

●    Lease expense decreased $31,910 due to the termination of the Company’s long term office lease in 2023.

 

This was partially offset by the following:

 

●    Inventory write-off increased by $38,470 for inventory that was disposed of (due to flour passing its best before date) during the

      three months ended March 31, 2024, $nil during the three months ended March 31,

      2023.

 

Other Expenses / (Income)

 

Other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased due to the following:

 

●    Change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $3,397,801 due to the Company’s stock price stabilizing during the

      period between December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment as at March 31,

      2024.

●    Increase in loss on debt extinguishment increased by $410,433 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the

      Company’s common shares which triggered an extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the

      conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

      

 

This was partially offset by the following:

 

●    Accretion interest on debentures decreased by $508,265 due to a significant amount of debentures repaid in cash and shares during

      2023, resulting in less interest accreted during March 31, 2024.

      

●    Loss on conversion of convertible debt decreased by $146,971 due to shares issued upon conversion were issued at a smaller premium

      above the exercise price compared to shares issued during March 31, 2023.

      

●    Foreign exchange gain increased by $61,251 (March 31, 2023 – foreign exchange loss of $6,620) due to increasing USD to CAD rate

      throughout the three months ended March 31, 2024.

      

●    All other items aggregate to $9,166.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, financial markets, business and other factors. We have recorded a net loss of $3,327,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and a net loss of $1,720,053 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We have recorded an accumulated deficit of $47,835,004 as of March 31, 2024 and $44,507,304 as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was $1,309,334 and $2,647,873 respectively.

 

The Company held $2,863,391 in cash at March 31, 2024 as compared to $3,878,578 at December 31, 2023.

 

                                                                   25

 

 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

 

●    the cost and timing of our regulatory activities, especially the process to obtain regulatory approval for our intellectual

      properties in the U.S. and in foreign

      countries

●    the costs of R&D activities we undertake to further develop our technology

●    the costs of constructing our grow houses, including any impact of complications, delays, and other unknown events

●    the costs of commercialization activities, including sales, marketing and production

●    the level of working capital required to support our growth

●    our need for additional personnel, information technology or other operating infrastructure to support our growth and operations

      as a public

      company

●    completion of planned acquisitions

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the stage of development of its first facility and other IP. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

For the next twelve months from issuance of these financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.

 

Cash Flows

 

The net cash used by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1,309,334 compared to $2,647,873 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease of $1,338,539 was primarily due to the following:

 

●    Decrease in net loss of $1,607,647 due to operating expenses noted above.

●    Decrease in cash flow adjustments of $300,195 for share based compensation due to forfeiture of stock options by departed

      employees.

      

●    Decrease of $499,870 in amortization of debt issuance costs for less interest recorded on debentures as the carrying value of the

      debentures were lower as at March 31, 2024 compared to March 31,

      2023.

●    Decrease of loss on debt conversion of $146,971 due to shares issued upon conversion were issued at a smaller premium above the

      exercise price compared to shares issued during March 31,

      2023.

●    Increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets used in operating activities of $188,215 due to utilization of consulting

      retainers during March 31, 2024 with no additional retainers

      added.

 

This was partially offset by the following:

 

●    Non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $3,397,801 due to the Company’s stock price stabilizing

      during the period between December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment as at March 31,

      2024.

●    Increase in loss on debt extinguishment cash adjustment by $410,433 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the

      Company’s common shares which triggered extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the

      conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the three months ended March 31,

      2023.

●    Decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities adjustments of $290,475 due to the Company reducing operational spend as such

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework in the 2013 COSO framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 

Changes in Internal Controls.

 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

 

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
