B. RILEY FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS

B. Riley Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) provide investment banking, brokerage, wealth management, asset management, direct lending, business advisory, valuation, and asset disposition services to a broad client base spanning public and private companies, financial sponsors, investors, financial institutions, legal and professional services firms, and individuals. The Company also has a portfolio of communication related businesses that provide consumer Internet access and cloud communication services and owns Tiger US Holdings Inc. (“Targus”), which designs and sells laptop and computer accessories. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, management reassessed the Company's previously reported Consumer segment due to organizational changes and financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). These changes resulted in Targus's operations being reported on a stand-alone basis in the Consumer Products segment and the operations related to brand licensing that were previously reported in the Consumer segment being reported in the All Other Category that is reported with Corporate and Other. As a result of the changes, the Company has recast the financial data for the Consumer Products segment and reporting of the All Other Category for all periods presented. 

The Company operates in six reportable operating segments: (i) Capital Markets, through which the Company provides investment banking, corporate finance, securities lending, restructuring, research, sales and trading services to corporate and institutional clients; (ii) Wealth Management, through which the Company provides wealth management and tax services to corporate and high-net-worth clients; (iii) Auction and Liquidation, through which the Company provides auction and liquidation services to help clients dispose of assets that include multi-location retail inventory, wholesale inventory, trade fixtures, machinery and equipment, intellectual property and real property; (iv) Financial Consulting, through which the Company provides bankruptcy, financial advisory, forensic accounting, real estate consulting and valuation and appraisal services; (v) Communications, through which the Company provides consumer Internet access and related subscription services, cloud communication services, and mobile phone voice, text, and data services and devices; and (vi) Consumer Products, which generates revenue through sales of laptop and computer accessories. 

NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of B. Riley Financial, Inc. and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The Company consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest. In addition, the Company performs an analysis to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”) including ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. See Note 2(n) for further discussion.

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to interim financial reporting guidelines and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 24, 2024. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future periods.

7





(b) Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as valuation of securities, allowance for credit losses, the fair value of loans receivables, intangible assets and goodwill, share based arrangements, contingent consideration, accounting for income tax valuation allowances, and sales returns and allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.

(c) Interest Expense — Securities Lending Activities 

Interest expense from securities lending activities is included in operating expenses related to operations in the Capital Markets segment. Interest expense from securities lending activities is incurred from equity and fixed income securities that are loaned to the Company and totaled $35,383 and $32,424 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(d) Concentration of Risk

Revenues in the Capital Markets, Financial Consulting, Wealth Management, and Communications segments are primarily generated in the United States. Revenues in the Auction and Liquidation segment and Consumer Products segment are primarily generated in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Europe. 

The Company maintains cash in various federally insured banking institutions. The account balances at each institution periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) insurance coverage, and as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company also has substantial cash balances from proceeds received from auctions and liquidation engagements that are distributed to parties in accordance with the collaborative arrangements.

The Company’s activities in the Auction and Liquidation segment are executed frequently with, and on behalf of, distressed customers and secured creditors. Concentrations of credit risk can be affected by changes in economic, industry, or geographical factors. The Company seeks to control its credit risk and potential risk concentration through risk management activities that limit the Company’s exposure to losses on any one specific liquidation services contract or concentration within any one specific industry. To mitigate the exposure to losses on any one specific liquidations services contract, the Company sometimes conducts operations with third parties through collaborative arrangements.

On December 18, 2023, the Company loaned $108,000 to Conn’s Inc. (“Conn’s”) as more fully described in Note 19. On February 14, 2024, the Company collected $15,000 of principal payments which reduced the loan balance to $93,000. This loan combined with two other existing loans receivable with an outstanding balance of $58,350 and $62,808 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is collateralized by consumer loan receivables of customers of the furniture and electronics retailer. These loans have an aggregate fair value of $147,630 and $167,568 or 32.6% and 31.5% of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are concentrated in the retail industry. In the event there is a recession or economic downturn that would put pressure on the retailer’s customers, this could impact the operations of the retailer and payment patterns of the customers and the overall performance and collectability of these loans. 



The Company also has a loan receivable with a principal amount of $200,506 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The loan receivable allows for interest to be paid-in-kind, which is capitalized to the loan receivable balance annually on the loan's anniversary date. The interest receivable on the loan was $14,971 and $8,889 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The loan receivable is secured by a first priority security interest in Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC (“Freedom VCM”) equity interests owned by Brian Kahn as more fully described in Note 2(h) below. The fair value of the loan receivable was $183,268 and $200,506 or 40.5% and 37.7% of the total loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deterioration in the collateral, including in the performance of Freedom VCM or delays in the execution of its strategies, including the possible disposition of additional businesses and further de-leveraging of its balance sheet, for the loan receivable may impact the ultimate collection of principal and interest.

The maximum amount of loss that the Company is exposed to is equivalent to the fair value of these loans which totaled $330,898 and $368,074 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

(e) Advertising Expenses 

The Company expenses advertising costs, which consist primarily of costs for printed materials, as incurred. Advertising costs totaled $2,410 and $2,937 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising expense was included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

(g) Restricted Cash

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash included $1,889 and $1,875, respectively, primarily consisting of cash collateral for leases.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of the following:



                                                                                                     March 31,         December 31,

                                                                                                       2024                2023

Cash and cash equivalents                                                                       $        190,690   $        231,964 

Restricted cash                                                                                             1,889               1,875 

Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash                                                $        192,579   $        233,839 

(h) Loans Receivable

Under ASC 825 - Financial Instruments, the Company elected the fair value option for all outstanding loans receivable. Management evaluates the performance of the loan portfolio on a fair value basis. Under the fair value option, loans receivables are measured at each reporting period based upon their exit value in an orderly transaction and unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Loans receivable, at fair value totaled $452,496 and $532,419 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The loans have various maturities through August 2033. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the historical cost of loans receivable accounted for under the fair value option was $494,730 and $555,882, respectively, which included principal balances of $499,956 and $563,637 respectively, and unamortized costs, origination fees, premiums and discounts, totaling $5,226 and $7,755, respectively. The principal balance of loans receivable exceeded the fair value of loans by $42,234 and $23,463 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At the time of origination, the Company's loans are collateralized by the assets of borrowers and other pledged collateral and may have guarantees to provide for protection of the payments due on loans receivable. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded net unrealized losses of $18,771 and net unrealized gains of $43,459, respectively, on loans receivable, at fair value, which is included in trading income (loss) and fair value adjustments on loans on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Loans receivable, at fair value on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was approximately zero as of March 31, 2024. Loans receivable, at fair value on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was $41,236, which represents approximately 7.7% of total loans receivable, at fair value as of December 31, 2023. The principal balance of loans receivable on non-accrual and 90 days or greater past due was $43,326 as of December 31, 2023. Interest income for loans on non-accrual and/or 90 days or greater past due is recognized separately from changes in fair value in interest income - loans and securities lending on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amount of gains or (losses) included in earnings attributable to changes in instrument – specific credit risk was $(11,339) and $37,488 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gains or losses attributable to changes in instrument – specific risk was determined by management based on an estimate of the fair value change during the period specific to each loan receivable.

The Company may periodically provide limited guarantees to third parties for loans that are made to investment banking and lending clients. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has outstanding limited guarantee arrangements with respect to Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (“B&W”) as further described in Note 16(b). In accordance with the credit loss standard, the Company evaluates the need to record an allowance for credit losses for these loan guarantees since they have off-balance sheet credit exposures. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has not recorded any provision for credit losses on the B&W guarantees since the Company believes that there is sufficient collateral to protect the Company from any credit loss exposure.

Interest income on loans receivable is recognized based on the stated interest rate of the loan on the unpaid principal balance plus the amortization of any costs, origination fees, premiums and discounts and is included in interest income - loans and securities lending on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.

On August 21, 2023, one of the Company’s subsidiaries and Vintage Capital Management, LLC (“VCM”), an affiliate of Brian Kahn, amended and restated a promissory note (the “Amended and Restated Note”), pursuant to which VCM owes the Company's subsidiary the aggregate principal amount of $200,506 and bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum payable-in-kind with a maturity date of December 31, 2027. The Amended and Restated Note requires repayments prior to the maturity date from certain proceeds received by VCM, Mr. Kahn or his affiliates from, among other proceeds, distributions or dividends paid by Freedom VCM in amount equal to the greater of (i) 80% of the net after-tax proceeds, and (ii) 50% of gross proceeds. The obligations under the Amended and Restated Note are primarily secured by a first priority perfected security interest in Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, the CEO and a board member of Freedom VCM as of December 31, 2023, and his spouse with a value (based on the transaction price in the FRG take-private transaction) of $227,296 as of August 21, 2023. On January 22, 2024, Mr. Kahn resigned as CEO and a member of the board of directors of Freedom VCM. The fair value of the Freedom VCM equity interest owned by Mr. Kahn and his spouse was $197,782 and $232,065 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amounts owing under the Amended and Restated Note may be repaid at any time without penalty. On a quarterly basis, the Company will continue to obtain third party appraisals to evaluate the value of the collateral of the loan since the repayment of the loan and accrued interest will be paid primarily from the cash distributions from Freedom VCM or foreclosure on the underlying collateral. In light of Mr. Kahn’s alleged involvement with the alleged misconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be subject to claims asserting an interest in the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and Restated Note. If a claim were successful, it would diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are made, however, the Company believes it has valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Other factors leading to a deterioration in the collateral, including in the performance of Freedom VCM or delays in the execution of its strategies, including the possible disposition of additional businesses and further de-leveraging of its balance sheet, for the loan receivable may impact the ultimate collection of principal and interest. In the event the loan balance and accrued interest exceed the underlying collateral value of the loan, this will impact the fair value of the loan and result in an unrealized loss being recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Interest income on loans receivable is recognized based on the stated interest rate of the loan on the unpaid principal balance plus the amortization of any costs, origination fees, premiums and discounts and is included in interest income - loans and securities lending on the consolidated statements of operations. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts, and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.

As of March 31, 2024, loans receivable had an aggregate remaining contractual principal balance of $499,956, an aggregate fair value of $452,496, and the contractual principal balance exceeded the fair value by $47,460. As of December 31, 2023, loans receivable had an aggregate remaining contractual principal balance of $563,637, an aggregate fair value of $532,419, and the contractual principal balance exceeded the fair value by $31,218. 

Badcock Loan Receivable

On December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“Badcock Receivables I”) with W.S. Badcock Corporation, a Florida corporation (“WSBC”), which at the time was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Franchise Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FRG”), which became a subsidiary of Freedom VCM as a result of the transaction on August 21, 2023. The Company paid $400,000 in cash to WSBC for the purchase of certain consumer credit receivables of WSBC. On September 23, 2022, the Company's then majority-owned subsidiary, B Riley 

10





Receivables II, LLC (“BRRII”), a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“Badcock Receivables II”) with WSBC. This purchase of $168,363 consumer credit receivables of WSBC was partially financed by a $148,200 term loan discussed in Note 10. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, BRRII entered into Amendment No. 2 and No. 3 to Badcock Receivables II with WSBC for a total of $145,278 in additional consumer credit receivables. The accounting for these transactions resulted in the Company recording a loan receivable from WSBC with the recognition of interest income at an imputed rate based on the cash flows expected to be received from the collection of the consumer receivables that serve as collateral for the loan. These loan receivables are measured at fair value. 

On August 21, 2023, all of the equity interests of BRRII were sold to Freedom VCM Receivables, Inc. (“Freedom VCM Receivables”), a subsidiary of Freedom VCM, which resulted in a loss of $78. In connection with the sale, Freedom VCM Receivables assumed the obligations with respect to the Pathlight Credit Agreement as more fully discussed in Note 10 and Freedom VCM Receivables entered into a non-recourse promissory note with another Freedom VCM affiliate in the amount of $58,872, with a stated interest rate of 19.74% and a maturity date of August 21, 2033 with payments of principal and interest on the note limited solely to the performance of certain consumer receivables held by BRRII. This loan receivable is measured at fair value. 

In connection with these loans, the Company entered into a Servicing Agreement with WSBC pursuant to which WSBC provides to the Company certain customary servicing and account management services in respect of the receivables purchased by the Company under the Receivables Purchase Agreement. In addition, subject to certain terms and conditions, FRG has agreed to guarantee the performance by WSBC of its obligations under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreements and the Servicing Agreement. 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Badcock Receivables I loan receivable to WSBC in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets included loans measured at fair value in the amount of $15,868 and $20,624, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Freedom VCM Receivables’ loan receivable in connection with the sale of all of the equity interests of BRRII was included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets in loans receivable, at fair value in the amount of $42,482 and $42,183, respectively. 

Nogin Loan and Loan Commitment



On November 16, 2023, the Company entered into a Chapter 11 Restructuring Support Agreement (as amended, the “RSA”) with Nogin Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Nogin”), and certain holders of Nogin’s convertible notes (the “Consenting Noteholders”). Pursuant to the RSA, the Company funded $17,530 of debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing as of December 31, 2023. The Company funded an additional $15,470 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which increased the DIP financing to $33,000 at March 31, 2024.

The Company owns certain equity securities that are accounted for under the fair value option where the Company would otherwise use the equity method of accounting. Investments become subject to the equity method of accounting when the Company possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the Company possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. However, the Company may have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee when the Company owns less than 20% of the voting interests of the investee depending on the facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise influence is present, such as when the Company has representation on the board of directors of such investee.

The Brand Investments

The following tables contain summarized financial information with respect to five of the Company's investments in limited liability companies that primarily license brand names and trademarks through licensing agreements. The Company has an ownership interest in each investee between 10% and 50%. For the 10% ownership interest, the Company is presumed to have the ability to exercise significant influence since the investment is more than minor and the limited liability company is required to maintain specific ownership accounts for each member. The Company has significant influence in the other four investments due to the ownership interest being greater than 20%. The financial information of these five investments has been aggregated and included below for purposes of the disclosure a quarter in arrears (balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 correspond to amounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of the Company; income statement amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 correspond to amounts during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of the Company), which is the period in which the most recent financial information is available:

Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC Equity Interest and Take-Private Transaction

On August 21, 2023, the Company acquired an equity interest in Freedom VCM for $216,500 in cash in connection with the closing of the acquisition of FRG, by a buyer group that included members of senior management of FRG, led by Mr. Kahn, FRG’s then Chief Executive Officer (the “FRG take-private transaction”). In connection with the closing of the FRG take-private transaction, the Company terminated an investment advisory agreement (the “Advisory Agreement”) with Mr. Kahn. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, Mr. Kahn, as financial advisor, had the sole power to vote or dispose of $64,644 of shares of FRG common stock (based on the value of FRG shares in the FRG take-private transaction as of the closing date of such transaction) held of record by B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“BRS”). Upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement, (i) Mr. Kahn’s right to vote or dispose of such FRG shares terminated, (ii) such FRG shares owned by BRS were rolled over into additional equity interests in Freedom VCM in connection with the FRG take-private transaction, and (iii) Mr. Kahn owed a total of $20,911 to the Company under the Advisory Agreement which amount was added to, and included in, the Amended and Restated Note. 

Following these transactions, the Company owns an equity interest of $281,144 or 31% of the outstanding equity interests in Freedom VCM. Also in connection with the FRG take-private transaction, on August 21, 2023 all of the equity interests of BRRII, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, were sold to a Freedom VCM affiliate, which resulted in a loss of $78. In connection with the sale, the Freedom VCM affiliate assumed the obligations with respect to the Pathlight Credit Agreement, as further discussed in Note 10, and the Company entered into a non-recourse promissory note with another Freedom VCM affiliate in the amount of $58,872, with a stated interest rate of 19.74% and a maturity date of August 21, 2033 (the “Freedom Receivables Note”) with payments of principal and interest on the note limited solely to performance of certain receivables held by BRRII.

The Company has elected to account for this 31% equity investment under the fair value option. The following tables contain summarized financial information with respect to Freedom VCM, included below for purposes of the disclosure a quarter in arrears (balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 correspond to amounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of the Company; income statement amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2023 correspond to amounts during the three months ended March 31, 2024 of the Company), which is the period in which the most recent financial information is available:

(j) Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments that are highly liquid, observable, and actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable and can be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

The Company’s securities and other investments owned and securities sold and not yet purchased are comprised of common and preferred stocks and warrants, corporate bonds, and investments in partnerships. Investments in common stocks that are based on quoted prices in active markets are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company also holds loans receivable valued at fair value, nonpublic common and preferred stocks and warrants for which there is little or no public market and fair value is determined by management on a consistent basis. For investments where little or no public market exists, management’s determination of fair value is based on the best available information which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration various factors including earnings history, financial condition, recent sales prices of the issuer’s securities and liquidity risks. These investments are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Investments in partnership interests include investments in private equity partnerships that primarily invest in equity securities, bonds, and direct lending funds. The Company also invests in priority investment funds and the underlying securities held by these funds are primarily corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities and restrictions exist on the redemption of amounts invested by the Company. The Company’s partnership and investment fund interests are valued based on the Company’s proportionate share of the net assets of the partnerships and funds; the value for these investments is derived from the most recent statements received 

16





from the general partner or fund administrator. These partnership and investment fund interests are valued at net asset value (“NAV”) and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy in the table below in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, partnership and investment fund interests valued at NAV of $18,964 and $35,196, respectively, are included in securities and other investments owned in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Securities and other investments owned also include investments in nonpublic entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not report NAV per share. These investments are accounted for using a measurement alternative under which they are measured at cost and adjusted for observable price changes and impairments. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. For these transactions to be considered observable price changes of the same issuer, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold. The following table presents, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of equity securities measured under the measurement alternative investments and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes:

The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, investments adjusted to their fair value by applying the measurement alternative, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The amount reported in the table above during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 included the amount of undistributed earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests that is distributed on a quarterly basis. The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the senior notes payable had a carrying amount of $1,553,616 and $1,668,021, respectively, and fair value of $1,038,272 and $1,127,503, respectively. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company's notes payable, revolving credit facility, and term loans of $632,784 and $688,343 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximates fair value because the effective yield of such instrument is consistent with current market rates of interest for instruments of comparable credit risk.

The investments in nonpublic entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis based on the observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Further adjustments are not made until another observable transaction occurs. Therefore, the determination of fair values of these investments in nonpublic entities that do not report NAV does not involve significant estimates and assumptions or subjective and complex judgments. Investments in nonpublic entities that do not report NAV are subject to a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company is required to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment charge in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value.

(k) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies. In countries where the functional currency of the underlying operations has been determined to be the local country’s currency, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains were $2,268 and losses were $234 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.

(l) Equity Method Investment

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an equity investment that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting had a carrying value of $2,046 and $2,087, respectively, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s share of earnings or losses from equity method investees included in income (loss) from equity investments was $(4) and $(10) during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

bebe stores, inc.

This was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the Company had no income from this equity investment during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On October 6, 2023, the Company purchased an additional 3,700,000 shares of bebe for an aggregate purchase price of $18,500, resulting in an increase in the Company's ownership interest to 76.2%. The purchase of these additional shares resulted in the Company having a majority voting interest in bebe and the consolidation of bebe financial results for periods subsequent to October 6, 2023.

(m) Supplemental Non-cash Disclosures

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there was non-cash investing activity related to the receipt of a note receivable in the amount of $2,000 related to the sale of certain assets and $42,077 related to a loan receivable, at fair value that converted into equity securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, non-cash investing activities included $15,000 of notes receivable that converted into equity securities; $1,190 of loans receivable, at fair value, that was included in consideration paid for the purchase of the Lingo noncontrolling interest; and $2,111 of common stock issued as part of the purchase price consideration for a business acquisition. During the three months ended months ended March 31, 2023, non-cash financing activities also included $7,000 in seller financing related to the purchase of the Lingo noncontrolling interest.

(n) Variable Interest Entities

The Company holds interests in various entities that meet the characteristics of a VIE but are not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Interests in these entities are generally in the form of equity interests, loans receivable, or fee arrangements.

The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a VIE and reconsiders that conclusion at each reporting date. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly by the Company or indirectly through related parties. 

The party with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: (a) which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; (b) which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE; (c) the VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders; (d) the terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and (e) related-party relationships with other parties that may also have a variable interest in the VIE.

On August 21, 2023, in connection with the FRG take-private transaction, one of the Company's subsidiaries (the “Lender”) and an affiliate of Mr. Kahn (the “Borrower”) entered into an amended and restated a promissory note as discussed further in Note 2(h) and 2(i) above. The Company was not involved in the design of the Borrower, has no equity financial interest, and has no rights to make decisions or participate in the management of the Borrower that significantly impact the economics of the Borrower. Since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the Borrower, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate the Borrower. The promissory note is included in loans receivable, at fair value in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and is a variable interest in accordance with the accounting guidance. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of loss exposure to the VIE was $215,477 and $209,395, respectively. 

The Company, has entered into agreements to provide investment banking and advisory services to numerous investment funds (the “Funds”) that are considered variable interest entities under the accounting guidance. 

The Company earns fees from the Funds in the form of placement agent fees and carried interest. For placement agent fees, the Company receives a cash fee of generally 7% to 10% of the amount of raised capital for the Funds and the fee is recognized at the time the placement services occurred. The Company receives carried interest as a percentage allocation (8% to 15%) of the profits of the Funds as compensation for asset management services provided to the Funds and it is recognized under the ownership model of ASC 323 - Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures as an equity method investment with changes in allocation recorded currently in the results of operations. As the fee arrangements under such agreements are arm’s length and contain customary terms and conditions and represent compensation that is considered fair value for the services provided, the fee arrangements are not considered variable interests and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate such VIEs.

Placement agent fees attributable to such arrangements were $372 and zero during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in services and fees in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The carrying amounts included in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets related to variable interests in VIEs that were not consolidated is shown below.

B. Riley Principal 250 Merger Corporation (“BRPM”) 

In 2021, the Company along with BRPM 250, a newly formed special purpose acquisition company incorporated as a Delaware corporation, consummated the initial public offering of 17,250,000 units of BRPM 250. Each Unit of BRPM 250 consisted of one share of class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of BRPM 250 class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The BRPM 250 Units were each sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to BRPM 250 of $172,500. These proceeds were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the BRPM 250 class A public shareholders and was included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These proceeds are invested only in U.S. treasury securities in accordance with the governing documents of BRPM 250. Under the terms of the BRPM 250 initial public offering, BRPM 250 was required to consummate a business combination transaction within 24 months (or 27 months under certain circumstances) of the completion of its initial public offering. 

In connection with the completion of the initial public offering of BRPM 250, the Company invested in the private placement units of BRPM 250. BRPM 250 was determined to be a VIE because it did not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company had determined that the class A shareholders of BRPM 250 do not have substantive rights as shareholders of BRPM 250 since these equity interests are determined to be temporary equity. As such, the Company had determined that it is the primary beneficiary of BRPM 250 as it has the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impact BRPM 250’s economic performance. Since the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, BRPM 250 was consolidated into the Company’s financial statements.

On April 21, 2023, the Board of Directors of BRPM 250 approved a plan to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of BRPM 250, effective as of May 4, 2023. The BRPM 250 Class A public shares were deemed cancelled on May 4, 2023, and the funds held in trust were used to fund the corresponding redemption amounts to the BRPM 250 Class A shareholders and BRPM 250 was no longer a VIE. 

(o) Recent Accounting Standards

Not yet adopted

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this update improve income tax disclosure requirements related to the transparency of rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures and the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit). The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its financial position and results of operations.



In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this update improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories included in each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss on an interim and annual basis. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on its financial position and results of operations.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS

2024 Acquisitions

On May 3, 2024, one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries completed the acquisition of Nogin for a total purchase consideration of approximately $59,000, which consisted of $37,700 in DIP financing (see Note 2(h)) and an additional $21,300 in cash consideration. To fund the $21,300 in cash consideration, contemporaneous with the closing, the acquired company issued $15,000 of convertible debt. The impact of the consolidation of Nogin’s financial statements is not expected to be material to the Company’s financial position or operating results. Since the controlling interest was acquired subsequent to quarter end, the Company believes the disclosure of pro forma financial information is impracticable because the financial information and valuation reports needed to account for the acquisition and prepare unaudited pro forma financial information has not been made available to the Company as of the reporting date.

2023 Acquisitions

Freedom VCM Equity Investment Acquisition - Pro Forma Financial Information



On August 21, 2023, the Company acquired approximately 31% equity interest in Freedom VCM for total consideration of $281,144. The equity interest was acquired in connection with Freedom VCM's acquisition of FRG by a buyer group that included members of senior management of FRG, led by Brian Kahn, FRG’s then Chief Executive Officer as part of the FRG take-private transaction.

The pro-forma financial information presented includes the effects of the common stock offering in July 2023 and adjustments related to additional interest expense from borrowings that the Company used to finance the acquisition of the equity interest. The Company has elected to account for the acquisition of the equity investment under the fair value option and any changes in fair value of the equity investment during future periods will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.



The pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition of the equity investment had taken place at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor does it intend to be a projection of future results.

The Company's securities lending transactions require us to pledge collateral based on the terms of each contract which is generally denominated in U.S. dollars and marked to market on a daily basis. If the fair value of the collateral pledged for these transactions declines, the Company could be required to provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore decreasing the amount of assets available for other liquidity needs that may arise. The Company's liquidity risk is mitigated by maintaining offsetting securities borrowed transactions in which the Company receives cash from the counterparty which, in general, is equal to or greater than the cash the Company posts on securities lending transactions.

Contract Balances

The timing of the Company’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenue until the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. Receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers totaled $123,797 and $115,496 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company had no significant impairments related to these receivables during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company also has $16,097 and $13,402 of unbilled receivables included in prepaid expenses and other assets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company’s deferred revenue primarily relates to retainer and milestone fees received from corporate finance and investment banking advisory engagements, asset management agreements, financial consulting engagements, subscription services where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied and license agreements with guaranteed minimum royalty payments and advertising/marketing fees with additional royalty revenue based on a percentage of defined sales. Deferred revenue as of March 31, 2024 and 

38





December 31, 2023 was $68,643 and $71,504, respectively. The Company expects to recognize the deferred revenue of $68,643 as of March 31, 2024 as service and fee revenues when the performance obligation is met during the years ended December 31, 2024 (remaining nine months), 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 in the amount of $44,986, $11,438, $5,415, $2,452, and $1,431, respectively. The Company expects to recognize the deferred revenue of $2,921 after December 31, 2028.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $21,297 and $22,502 that was recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective year. 

Contract Costs

Contract costs include: (1) costs to fulfill contracts associated with corporate finance and investment banking engagements are capitalized where the revenue is recognized at a point in time and the costs are determined to be recoverable; (2) costs to fulfill Auction and Liquidation services contracts where the Company guarantees a minimum recovery value for goods being sold at auction or liquidation where the revenue is recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied; and (3) commissions paid to obtain magicJack contracts which are recognized ratably over the contract term and third party support costs for magicJack and related equipment purchased by customers which are recognized ratably over the service period.

The capitalized costs to fulfill a contract were $7,338 and $8,131 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized expenses of $1,537 and $1,015 related to capitalized costs to fulfill a contract, respectively. There were no significant impairment charges recognized in relation to these capitalized costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Remaining Performance Obligations and Revenue Recognized from Past Performance

The Company does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. The transaction price allocated to remaining unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations with an original expected duration exceeding one year was not material as of March 31, 2024. Corporate finance and investment banking fees and retail liquidation engagement fees that are contingent upon completion of a specific milestone and fees associated with certain distribution services are also excluded as the fees are considered variable and not included in the transaction price as of March 31, 2024.

NOTE 14 — INCOME TAXES 

The Company’s effective income tax rate was a benefit of 26.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to a provision of 32.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a loss before income taxes of $65,044 and a benefit from income taxes of $17,090 resulting from the impact of items that are not tax deductible. The change in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily due to the impact of items that are not tax deductible on the loss of $65,044 before income taxes.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $46,384 and state net operating loss carryforwards of $64,247, respectively. In addition one of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries that is not included in the Company’s consolidated federal has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $298,416 and state net operating loss carryforwards of $225,585 available to utilize against future taxable income of the majority-owner subsidiary. The Company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the tax years commencing in December 31, 2033 through December 31, 2038. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the tax years commencing in December 31, 2030.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits of operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. The Company’s net operating losses are subject to annual limitations in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Accordingly, the Company is limited to the amount of net operating loss that may be utilized in future taxable years depending on the Company’s actual taxable income. As of March 31, 2024, the Company believes that the existing net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized in future tax periods before the loss carryforwards expire and it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable earnings will be 

39





sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets and has not provided a valuation allowance. The Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to utilize the benefits related to capital loss carryforwards and has provided a valuation allowance in the amount of $41,751 against these deferred tax assets.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., various state and local jurisdictions, and certain other foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by certain federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. The audits are in varying stages of completion. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by tax authorities. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, case law developments and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the provision for income taxes, as appropriate. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar years ended December 31, 2020 to 2023.

Pillar Two 

The Pillar Two directive, which was established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and which generally provides for a 15% minimum effective tax rate for multinational enterprises, in every jurisdiction in which they operate. While the Company does not anticipate that this will have a material impact on its tax provision or effective tax rate, it will continue to monitor evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

NOTE 15 — EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Remeasurements to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in equity of subsidiaries are not deemed to be a dividend. According to ASC 480 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, there is no impact on earnings per share in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share to common shareholders for changes in the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in equity, when such changes in carrying value which in substance approximates fair value.

Securities that could potentially dilute basic net income (loss) per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share were 3,282,390 and 1,999,273 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

NOTE 16 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(a) Legal Matters

The Company is subject to certain legal and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, the Company and its subsidiaries are named in and subject to various proceedings and claims arising primarily from the Company’s securities business activities, including lawsuits, arbitration claims, class actions, and regulatory matters. Some of these claims seek substantial compensatory, punitive, or indeterminate damages. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations regarding the Company’s business, which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, and other relief. In addition to such legal and other claims, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of unasserted claims, including, among others, as it relates to matters related to Mr. Kahn and our investment in Freedom VCM. For example, in light of Mr. Kahn’s alleged involvement with the alleged misconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be subject to claims asserting an interest in the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and Restated Note. If a claim were successful, it would diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are made, however, the Company believes it has valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Notwithstanding the uncertainties described in this paragraph, the Company does not believe that the results of these asserted or unasserted claims are likely to have a material effect on its financial statements.



On May 2, 2024, a putative class action was filed by Ted Donaldson in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company’s senior notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 dated January 28, 2021, and the prospectuses filed and published on August 4, 2021 and December 2, 2021 (the “Note Offerings”). The action asserts claims under §§ 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against the Company, certain of the Company's officers and directors, and the underwriters of the Note Offerings. The complaint alleges that defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including an alleged conspiracy to commit fraud. The Company believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend this action.



On January 24, 2024, a putative securities class action complaint was filed by Mike Coan in U.S. Federal District Court, Central District of California, against the Company, Bryant Riley, Tom Kelleher and Phillip Ahn (“Defendants”). The purported class includes persons and entities that purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges that (a) the Company failed to disclose to investors that (i) Brian Kahn, had been implicated in a conspiracy to defraud third party investors, and (ii) the Company financed Brian Kahn and others in connection with a going private transaction involving FRG, and (b) as a result of the foregoing, the Company engaged in securities fraud in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A second putative class action lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2024 by the KL Kamholz Joint Revocable Trust (“Kamholz”). This complaint asserts similar allegations as the Coan complaint and covers an alleged class period between February 28, 2022 and November 9, 2023. The Kamholz complaint further alleges that Defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including a conspiracy to commit fraud, and nonetheless proceeded with the FRG going-private transaction. The Company cannot estimate the amount of potential liability, if any, that could arise from these matters and believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend these actions.



On September 21, 2023, the Company received a demand alleging that certain payments in the aggregate amount of approximately $32,166 made by Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sorrento”), a chapter 11 debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas, to B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC (“BRCC”), pursuant to that certain Bridge Loan Agreement dated September 30, 2022 between Sorrento and BRCC, are avoidable as preferential transfers. The Company believes the Sorrento Unsecured Creditors Committee’s preference claims lack merit, and the Company intends to assert its statutory defenses to defeat the claim.

(b) Babcock & Wilcox Commitments and Guarantees

On January 18, 2024, the Company entered into a guaranty (the “Axos Guaranty”) in favor of (i) Axos Bank, in its capacity as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) for the secured parties under that certain credit agreement, dated as of January 18, 2024, among Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (“B&W”), the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the “B&W Axos Credit Agreement”), and (ii) the secured parties. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Axos Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of B&W (subject to certain limitations) under the B&W Axos Credit Agreement, including the obligation to repay outstanding loans and letters of credit and to pay earned interest, fees costs and expenses of enforcing the Axos Guaranty, provided however, that the Company’s obligations with respect to the principal amount of credit extensions and unreimbursed letter of credit 

41





obligations under the B&W Axos Credit Agreement shall not at any time exceed $150,000 in the aggregate, which is the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guaranty. In consideration for the agreements and commitments under the Axos Guaranty and pursuant to a separate fee and reimbursement agreement, B&W has agreed to pay the Company a fee equal to 2.00% of the aggregate revolving commitments (as defined in the B&W Axos Credit Agreement) under the B&W Axos Credit Agreement, payable quarterly and, at B&W’s election, in cash in full or 50% in cash and 50% in the form of penny warrants.

On June 30, 2021, the Company agreed to guaranty (the “Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty”) up to $110,000 of obligations that B&W may owe to providers of cash collateral pledged in connection with a debt financing for B&W. The Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty is enforceable in certain circumstances, including, among others, certain events of default and the acceleration of B&W’s obligations under a reimbursement agreement with respect to such cash collateral. B&W will pay the Company $935 per annum in connection with the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty. B&W has agreed to reimburse the Company to the extent the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty is called upon. As of December 31, 2023, the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty was in respect of up to $90,000 of B&W obligations after B&W made paydowns of $10,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Cash Collateral Provider Guaranty was in respect of up to $67,500 of B&W obligations after B&W made paydowns of $22,500 during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

On December 22, 2021, the Company entered into a general agreement of indemnity in favor of one of B&W’s sureties. Pursuant to this indemnity agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify the surety in connection with a default by B&W under a €30,000 payment and performance bond issued by the surety in connection with a construction project undertaken by B&W. In consideration for providing the indemnity, B&W paid the Company fees in the amount of $1,694 on January 20, 2022.

On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into a project specific indemnity rider to a general agreement of indemnity made by B&W in favor of one of its sureties. Pursuant to the indemnity rider, the Company agreed to indemnify the surety in connection with a default by B&W under the underlying indemnity agreement relating to a $29,970 payment and performance bond issued by the surety in connection with a construction project undertaken by B&W. In consideration for providing the indemnity rider, B&W paid the Company fees in the amount of $600 on August 26, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the indemnity rider was reduced to $5,994. 

(c) FRG Commitments

On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into certain agreements pursuant to which the Company had, among other things, agreed to provide certain equity funding and other support in connection with the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Freedom VCM, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent”), of FRG. The Company entered into an Equity Commitment Letter with Freedom VCM (“TopCo”), the parent company of the Parent, and the Parent, pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide to TopCo, at or prior to the closing of the Acquisition, an amount equal to up to $560,000 in equity financing. The Company and FRG also entered into a Limited Guarantee in favor of FRG, pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee to FRG the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge when required by Parent or its subsidiary to FRG of certain liabilities and obligations of the Parent or such subsidiary. On August 21, 2023, in connection with the completion of the Acquisition and the Company's portion of the equity financing, the Company's obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee were satisfied and the Company was paid the $16,500 fee pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee.

(d) Other Commitments

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into commitments to its clients in connection with capital raising transactions, such as firm commitment underwritings, equity lines of credit, or other commitments to provide financing on specified terms and conditions. These commitments require the Company to purchase securities at a specified price or otherwise provide debt or equity financing on specified terms. Securities underwriting exposes the Company to market and credit risk, primarily in the event that, for any reason, securities purchased by the Company cannot be distributed at the anticipated price and to balance sheet risk in the event that debt or equity financing commitments cannot be syndicated. With respect to one of the Company’s investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an agreement whereby the subsidiary may be required, commencing in August 2027 and expiring in August 2028, to purchase additional equity capital at fair value which was originally valued at $15,000.

Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC 

On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into certain agreements pursuant to which the Company had, among other things, agreed to provide certain equity funding and other support as part of the FRG take-private transaction as previously discussed in Note 2(i). The Company entered into an Equity Commitment Letter with Freedom VCM, pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide up to $560,000 in equity financing at or prior to the closing of the FRG take-private transaction. On August 21, 2023, in connection with the completion of the FRG take-private transaction, the Company's obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee were satisfied. Upon closing the acquisition on August 21, 2023, the Company was paid an equity commitment fee of $16,500 which is included in services and fees revenues. At the time of the Company's equity investment on August 21, 2023, the Company's chief executive officer became a member of the board of directors of Freedom VCM.

On August 21, 2023, the Company purchased an equity interest in Freedom VCM for $216,500, which resulted in a total equity interest of $281,144 and a 31% voting interest and representation on the board of directors of Freedom VCM as part of the FRG take-private transaction as previously discussed in Note 2(i). As part of the FRG take-private transaction, certain members of management of Freedom VCM, which are related parties to Freedom VCM, exchanged their equity interest in FRG for a combined 35% voting interest in Freedom VCM, of which Mr. Kahn and his wife and one of Mr. Kahn’s affiliates comprised 32%. The Company has a first priority security interest in a 25% equity interest of Mr. Kahn (who was also CEO and a board member of Freedom VCM) in Freedom VCM to secure the loan to an affiliate of Mr. Kahn as more fully described in Note 2(h).

In connection with the FRG take-private transaction, all of the equity interests of BRRII, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, were sold to Freedom VCM Receivables (a subsidiary of Freedom VCM), for a purchase price of $58,872 which resulted in a loss of $78 on August 21, 2023. In connection with the sale, Freedom VCM Receivables assumed the obligations with respect to the Pathlight Credit Agreement as more fully discussed in Note 10 and as consideration for the purchase price, the Company entered into a non-recourse promissory note with another Freedom VCM affiliate in the amount of $58,872, with a stated interest rate of 19.74% and a maturity date of August 21, 2033. Payments of principal and interest on the note are limited solely to the performance of certain receivables held by BRRII. Principal and interest is payable based on the collateral without recourse to Freedom VCM Receivables, which includes the performance of certain consumer credit receivables. This loan receivable was measured at fair value in the amount of $42,482 and $42,183 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest income on the loan receivable was $2,154 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

45





As more fully described in Note 2(h), the Company also has a related party loan receivable with a fair value of approximately $15,868 and $20,624 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 from home-furnishing retailer W.S. Badcock Corporation (“Badcock”) that is collateralized by consumer finance receivables of Badcock. These consumer finance receivables were acquired from Badcock in multiple purchases beginning in December 2021. On December 18, 2023, Badcock was sold by Freedom VCM to Conn’s and the Company loaned Conn’s $108,000 which bears interest at an aggregate rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Conn’s Term Loan), subject to a 4.80% floor, plus a margin of 8.00% and matures on February 20, 2027. On February 14, 2024, the Company collected $15,000 of principal payments which reduced the loan balance to $93,000. Badcock now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Conn’s. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, interest income on these loans totaled $4,151. These loan receivables are reported as related party loan receivables due to the Company’s related party relationship with Freedom VCM and Freedom VCM’s ability to exercise influence over Conn’s as a result of the equity consideration Freedom VCM received from the sale of Badcock to Conn’s on December 18, 2023.

Simultaneously with the completion of the FRG take-private transaction, one of our subsidiaries and VCM, an affiliate of Brian Kahn, amended and restated a promissory note (the “Amended and Restated Note”), pursuant to which VCM owes our subsidiary the aggregate principal amount of $200,506 and bears interest at the rate of 12.00% per annum payable-in-kind with a maturity date of December 31, 2027. The Amended and Restated Note requires repayments prior to the maturity date from certain proceeds received by VCM, Mr. Kahn, or his affiliates from, among other proceeds, distributions or dividends paid by Freedom VCM in amount equal to the greater of (i) 80% of the net after-tax proceeds, and (ii) 50% of gross proceeds. The obligations under the Amended and Restated Note are primarily secured by a first priority perfected security interest in Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn and his spouse with a value (based on the transaction price in the FRG take-private transaction) of $227,296 as of August 21, 2023. The fair value of the Freedom VCM equity interest owned by Mr. Kahn and his spouse was $197,782 and $232,065 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In light of the Company’s determination that the repayment of the Amended and Restated Note will be paid primarily from the cash distributions from Freedom VCM or foreclosure on the underlying collateral provided by Mr. Kahn and his spouse being in Freedom VCM equity interests, the Company has determined that both VCM and Mr. Kahn are related parties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

NOTE 20 — BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Company’s business is classified into six reportable operating segments: the Capital Markets segment, Wealth Management segment, Auction and Liquidation segment, Financial Consulting segment, Communications segment, and Consumer Products segment. These reportable segments are all distinct businesses, each with a different marketing strategy and management structure. During the fourth quarter of 2023, management reassessed the Company's previously reported Consumer segment due to organizational changes and financial information provided to the CODM. These changes resulted in Targus’ operations being reported on a stand alone basis in the Consumer Products segment and the operations related to brand licensing that was previously reported in the Consumer segment being reported in the All Other Category that is reported with Corporate and Other. 

As a result of the changes discussed above in the Consumer segment, the Company has recast the financial data for the Consumer Products segment and reporting of the All Other Category for all periods presented. The following is a summary of certain financial data for each of the Company’s reportable segments:

This report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “future,” “intend,” “seek,” “likely,” “potential” or “continue,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We are under no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the filing of this Quarterly Report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including without limitation the disclosures made in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”

Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include but are not limited to risks related to: volatility in our revenues and results of operations; changing conditions in the financial markets; our ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability; our exposure to credit risk; the short term nature of our engagements; the accuracy of our estimates and valuations of inventory or assets in “guarantee” based engagements; failure to successfully compete in any of our businesses; potential losses related to our auction or liquidation engagements; our dependence on communications, information and other systems and third parties; potential losses related to purchase transactions in our auction and liquidations business; the potential loss of financial institution clients; potential losses from or illiquidity of our proprietary investments; changing economic and market conditions, including continuing inflation and any further actions by the Federal Reserve to address inflation and the possibility of recession or an economic downturn; the effects of pandemics or severe public health crises, and other related impacts including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increased labor costs; potential liability and harm to our reputation if we were to provide an inaccurate appraisal or valuation; potential mark-downs in inventory in connection with purchase transactions; loss of key personnel; our ability to borrow under our credit facilities or at-the-market offering as necessary; failure to comply with the terms of our credit agreements or senior notes; our ability to meet future capital requirements; our ability to realize the benefits of our completed acquisitions, including our ability to achieve anticipated opportunities and cost savings, and accretion to reported earnings estimated to result from completed and proposed acquisitions in the time frame expected by management or at all; the diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues; the failure of our brand investment portfolio licensees to pay us royalties; the impact of legal proceedings, including those related to the allegations raised against Brian Kahn; the activities of short sellers and their impact on our business and reputation; and the effect of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks, including the impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Except as otherwise required by the context, references in this Quarterly Report to the “Company,” “B. Riley,” “B. Riley Financial,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to the combined business of B. Riley Financial, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.

Overview

Description of the Company

B. Riley Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq: RILY) (the “Company”) is a diversified financial services platform that delivers tailored solutions to meet the strategic, operational, and capital needs of its clients and partners. We operate through several consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “B. Riley”) that provide investment banking, brokerage, wealth management, asset management, direct lending, business advisory, valuation, and asset disposition services to a broad client base spanning public and private companies, financial sponsors, investors, financial institutions, legal and professional services firms, and individuals.

The Company opportunistically invests in and acquires companies or assets with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles to benefit our shareholders. We own and operate several uncorrelated consumer businesses and invest in brands on a principal basis. Our approach is focused on high quality companies and assets in industries in which we have extensive knowledge and can benefit from our experience to make operational improvements and maximize free cash flow. Our principal investments often leverage the financial, restructuring, and operational expertise of our professionals who work collaboratively across disciplines. 



We refer to B. Riley as a “platform” because of the unique composition of our business. Our platform has grown considerably and become more diversified over the past several years. We have increased our market share and expanded the depth and breadth of our businesses both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. Our increasingly diversified platform enables us to invest opportunistically and to deliver strong long-term investment performance throughout a range of economic cycles.



We are headquartered in Los Angeles, California and maintain offices throughout the U.S. including in New York, Chicago, Metro District of Columbia, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Metro Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Miami, San Francisco, Boca Raton, and West Palm Beach, as well as additional offices located in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. 



We report our activities in six reportable business segments: Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Financial Consulting, Auction and Liquidation, Communications, and Consumer Products segment. These reportable segments are all distinct businesses, each with a different marketing strategy and management structure. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we reassessed our previously reported Consumer segment due to organizational changes and financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). These changes resulted in Targus’ operations being reported on a stand-alone basis in the Consumer Products segment and the operations related to brand licensing that was previously reported in the Consumer segment being reported in the All Other Category that is reported with Corporate and Other.

Recent Developments

Great American Group Strategic Alternatives Review. On February 29, 2024, we announced that we had retained Moelis & Company LLC as an independent financial advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives for our Appraisal and Valuation Services, and Retail, Wholesale & Industrial Solutions businesses (collectively formerly known as “Great American Group”), which could include a potential sale or other transaction. If a potential transaction were to be consummated, we anticipate that proceeds may be used in a variety of ways including de-levering our balance sheet, repurchasing shares and bonds in the open market, and investing in the platform and in particular, B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“BRS”). Moelis & Company LLC and the Company have started the strategic review process and began a solicitation of interest process in April 2024. There can be no assurances that we will complete, or as to the terms of, any such potential transaction. 

Audit Committee Review/Investigation. As previously disclosed, after we learned from news reports in November 2023 that Brian Kahn, the then Chief Executive Officer of Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC (“Freedom VCM”) and the Franchise Group, Inc. (“FRG”), was identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in SEC allegations and criminal charges of securities fraud against an executive of an unrelated hedge fund, the Audit Committee of the Board retained Sullivan & Cromwell LLP to conduct a thorough, internal review of the transactions among Mr. Kahn (and his affiliates) and the Company (and its affiliates). The review confirmed what we previously disclosed: that the Company and its executives, including Bryant Riley, had no involvement with, or knowledge of, any of the alleged misconduct concerning Brian Kahn or any of his affiliates. On February 22, 2024, our Board of Directors issued a statement regarding its review of the circumstances associated with our participation in the management-led buyout of FRG and related matters. 

Subsequently, the Audit Committee engaged Winston & Strawn LLP as separate, independent counsel to assist the Audit Committee in conducting an investigation of these same matters and related allegations. As separately disclosed by us on the date of this Annual Report, following receipt of the results of the Audit Committee's independent investigation as assisted by Winston & Strawn LLP, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reconfirmed that the Company and its executives, including Bryant R. Riley, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, had no involvement with, or knowledge of, any of the alleged misconduct concerning Brian Kahn or any of his affiliates.

Our diversified financial platform is affected by a variety of factors including continuing higher inflation, the actions by the Federal Reserve to address inflation, the possibility of recession or an economic downturn, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and rising energy prices. These factors create uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and may impact our business in future periods. These developments and the impact on the financial markets and the overall economy continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If 

51





the financial markets and/or the overall economy continue to be impacted, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting estimates, which include fair value measurements, goodwill and other intangible assets, and accounting for income tax valuation allowances can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Total revenues decreased $89.1 million to $343.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $432.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of the portfolio of securities and other investments owned and fair value adjustments on loans of $81.4 million, interest income from loans and securities lending of $17.2 million, and sale of goods of $12.1 million, partially offset by an increase in revenues from services and fees of $21.7 million. The increase in revenue from services and fees in the three months ended March 31, 2024 consisted of increases in revenue of $12.5 million in All Other, $10.1 million in the Financial Consulting segment, $2.6 million in the Wealth Management segment, and $2.4 million in the Capital Markets segment, partially offset by decreases in revenue of $4.0 million in the Communications segment, and $1.9 million in the Auction and Liquidation segment.

Revenues from services and fees in the Capital Markets segment increased $2.4 million to $60.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $57.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increases of $11.0 million of corporate finance, consulting, and investment banking fees, $0.5 million of other income, and $0.4 in asset management fees, partially offset by decreases of $6.5 million in dividends and $3.0 million of commission fees.

Revenues from services and fees in the Wealth Management segment increased $2.6 million to $51.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $48.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $2.7 million from wealth and asset management fees.

Revenues from services and fees in the Auction and Liquidation segment decreased $1.9 million to $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $5.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $2.9 million in commission fees, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in service contract revenues. The decrease in commission fees was related to a decrease in the size of fee engagements.

Revenues from services and fees in the Financial Consulting segment increased $10.1 million to $35.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $25.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase of $8.5 million within our Advisory Services division primarily consisting of $2.9 million due to a full quarter of revenues from acquisitions in the prior year and $5.6 million in advisory services. The remaining increase in revenues was due to an increase of $1.6 million in Appraisal due to an increase in the number of appraisals performed. 

Revenues from services and fees in the Communications segment decreased $4.0 million to $81.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $85.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases in subscription revenue of $3.3 million and $0.7 million in advertising, licensing and other revenue. We expect UOL, magicJack, and Marconi subscription revenue to continue to decline year over year.

Revenues from services and fees in All Other increased $12.5 million to $26.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $13.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. These revenues include the licensing of brand trademarks, merchandise rental fees and sales from bebe stores, inc. (“bebe”) in which we acquired a controlling interest and consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2023, and the operations of a regional environmental services business and a landscaping business that we acquired in 2022 and sold in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues from services and fees in All Other increased by approximately $14.0 million related to merchandise rental fees from bebe, $0.3 million related to the regional environmental services business, and $0.3 million related to licensing of brand trademarks, partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $2.1 million due to the sale of the landscaping business in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Trading income (loss) and fair value adjustments on loans decreased approximately $81.4 million to a loss of $29.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to income of $51.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The loss of $29.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to realized and unrealized losses on our loans receivable, at fair value of $12.2 million, partially offset by realized and unrealized losses on investments made in our proprietary trading accounts of $17.7 million. The income of $51.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to unrealized gains on our loans receivable, at fair value of $43.3 million and realized and unrealized gains on investments made in our proprietary trading accounts of $8.3 million.

Interest income – loans and securities lending decreased $17.2 million to $59.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $77.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Interest income from securities lending was $37.8 million and $37.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income from loans was $22.1 million and $40.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the decrease due to a reduction in loan receivable balances from $772.1 million as of March 31, 2023 to $452.5 million as of March 31, 2024.

Revenues from the sale of goods decreased $12.1 million to $55.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $67.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023.The decrease in revenues from sale of goods was attributable to a decrease of $14.2 million from the Consumer Products segment due to a decrease in computer and laptop sales worldwide and a decrease of $0.6 million from the Communications segment, partially offset by an increase of $2.0 million from the Auction and Liquidation segment due to larger international asset deals and an increase of $0.6 million in All Other due to sale of goods from bebe in which we acquired a controlling interest and consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased approximately $8.0 million to $39.6 million from $47.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to decreases of $8.5 million in the Consumer Products segment and $0.8 million in the Communications segment, partially offset by increases of $0.7 million from the Auction and Liquidation segment and $0.6 million from All Other.

Direct Cost of Services

Direct cost of services increased approximately $6.7 million to $61.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $54.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in direct cost of services was primarily attributable to increases of $4.1 million from the Communications segment and $4.3 million from All Other due to bebe in which we acquired a controlling interest and consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million from the Auction and Liquidation segment due to the size of the fee deals.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our operations are funded through a combination of existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under our senior notes payable, term loans and credit facilities, and special purposes financing arrangements. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated net loss of $48.0 million and net income of $16.6 million, respectively. The Company operates a number of businesses in its segments that provide steady cash flows and operating income throughout the year, however, our cash flows and profitability are impacted by capital market engagements and retail liquidation engagements performed on a quarterly and annual basis, which may be episodic in nature, and amounts realized from the sale of our investments in marketable securities.

As of March 31, 2024, we had $190.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $1.9 million of restricted cash, $949.9 million of securities and other investments, at fair value, $452.5 million of loans receivable, at fair value, and $2,186.4 million of borrowings outstanding.

(“bebe”) credit agreements discussed below, $22.2 million of revolving credit facility under the Targus credit facility discussed below, and $14.3 million of notes payable.

We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, securities and other investments owned, funds available under our asset based credit facility, funds available under the Targus and Nomura revolving credit facilities, and cash expected

to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance date of the accompanying financial statements. Due to the fact that we are no longer a well known seasoned issued and no longer eligible to file a short form registration statement with the SEC, accessing the capital markets could take longer and cost more than would otherwise be the case. We continue to monitor our financial performance to ensure sufficient liquidity to fund operations and execute on our business plan.



From time to time, we may decide to pay dividends which will be dependent upon our financial condition and results of operations. On May 15, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of $0.50 per share that will be paid on or about June 11, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $141.1 million. While it is the Board’s current intention to make regular dividend payments each quarter and special dividend payments dependent upon exceptional circumstances from time to time, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant. The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

If an event of default occurs, the agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the BRPAC Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all financial covenants in the BRPAC Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2024.

The maturity dates of outstanding senior notes ranged from May 2024 to August 2028 pursuant to At the Market Issuance Sales Agreements with B. Riley Securities, Inc. which governs the program of at-the-market sales of the Company’s senior notes. A series of prospectus supplements were filed by the Company with the SEC in respect of the Company’s offerings of these senior notes.

In June 2023, we entered into note purchase agreements in connection with the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2024 (“6.75% 2024 Notes”) that were issued for the Targus acquisition.

Recent Accounting Standards

See Note 2(o) to the accompanying financial statements for recent accounting standards.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.



We transact business in various foreign currencies. In countries where the functional currency of the underlying operations has been determined to be the local country’s currency, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Interest Rate Risk



Our primary exposure to market risk consists of risk related to changes in interest rates. We utilize borrowings under our senior notes payable and credit facilities to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions and 

65





operations. Borrowings under our senior notes payable are at fixed interest rates and borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate of interest. In our portfolio of securities owned, we invest in loans receivable that primarily bear interest at a floating rate of interest. If floating rates of interest had increased by 1% during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the rate increase would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of $1.7 million.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income that we receive from investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investments allow us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments through a variety of securities owned that primarily includes common stocks, loans receivable, and investments in partnership interests. Our cash and cash equivalents through March 31, 2024 included amounts in bank checking and liquid money market accounts. We may be exposed to interest rate risk through trading activities in convertible and fixed income securities as well as U.S. Treasury securities, however, based on our daily monitoring of this risk, we believe we currently have limited exposure to interest rate risk in these activities.

Foreign Currency Risk 

The majority of our operating activities are conducted in U.S. dollars. Revenues generated from our foreign subsidiaries totaled $37.4 million and $30.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or 10.9% and 7.0% of our total revenues of $343.0 million and $432.1 million. The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, with the exception of revenues, costs, and expenses, which are translated at average rates during the reporting period. We include gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in income, while we exclude those resulting from translation of financial statements from income and include them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains (losses), which were included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, amounted to a gain of $2.3 million and loss of $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We may be exposed to foreign currency risk; however, our operating results during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, included $37.4 million and $30.5 million of revenues, respectively, and $7.8 million and $8.4 million of operating expenses from our foreign subsidiaries, respectively, and a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million change in our operating income during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.



Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



Other than as set forth below under “Material Weakness and Remediation,” there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Material Weakness and Remediation



The Company previously identified in its 2023 Annual Report the following material weaknesses:



•The Company identified two separate material weaknesses in controls related to information technology general controls (ITGCs) at our Lingo Management, LLC and Tiger US Holdings, Inc. subsidiaries in the areas of user access, 

66





program change management, and information technology (IT) operations over IT systems and the reports generated from these systems used in the execution of controls that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. As a result, business-process automated and manual controls that were dependent on the affected ITGCs could have been adversely impacted.



•The Company identified a separate material weakness relating to ITGC issues in one of our B. Riley Advisory Holdings, LLC subsidiaries primarily related to ineffective controls over user access management over a certain business application. As a result, business-process automated and manual controls that were dependent on the affected ITGCs could have been adversely impacted.



•The Company was unable to rely on a System and Organization Controls (“SOC”) 1 Type 2 report associated with the utilization of a third-party service organization's hosted IT solution for the processing of customer sales and billing information in our Marconi Wireless subsidiary. As a result, the internal control processes performed by the third-party service organization were not designed or implemented to operate at a sufficient level of precision. As such, the Company could not rely on the information produced by the system. Business-process automated and manual controls that were dependent on these controls could have been adversely impacted.



•The Company identified a material weakness relating to the operating effectiveness of management's review controls over investment valuations such that management's review procedures were not operating at a level of precision sufficient to prevent or detect a potential material misstatement in the consolidated statements.



•The Company did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and disclose material related party transactions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 850, Related Party Disclosures, which resulted in a material weakness.



Management continues to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses noted above are remediated, such that the controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the enhancement of control activity evidence, improvement of the precision level of management review controls, and enhancement to policies and procedures, and, as to the material weakness related to Marconi Wireless, we continue to work with our third-party service organization supporting Marconi Wireless to provide a compliant SOC 1 Type 2 report in 2024. 



While we continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. We expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2024. 



Inherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls



Our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well- designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.



The Company is subject to certain legal and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, the Company and its subsidiaries are named in and subject to various proceedings and claims arising primarily from the Company’s securities business activities, including lawsuits, arbitration claims, class actions, and regulatory matters. Some of these claims seek substantial compensatory, punitive, or indeterminate damages. The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations regarding the Company’s business, which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, and other relief. In addition to such legal and other claims, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of unasserted claims, including, among others, as it relates to matters related to Mr. Kahn and our investment in Freedom VCM. For example, in light of Mr. Kahn’s alleged involvement with the alleged misconduct concerning Prophecy Asset Management LP, the Company can provide no assurances that it will not be subject to claims asserting an interest in the Freedom VCM equity interests owned by Mr. Kahn, including those that collateralize the Amended and Restated Note. If a claim were successful, it would diminish the value of the collateral which could impact the carrying value of the loan. If such claims are made, however, the Company believes it has valid defenses from any such claim and any such claim would be without merit. Notwithstanding the uncertainties described in this paragraph, the Company does not believe that the results of these asserted or unasserted claims are likely to have a material effect on its financial statements.



On May 2, 2024, a putative class action was filed by Ted Donaldson in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company’s senior notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-3 dated January 28, 2021, and the prospectuses filed and published on August 4, 2021 and December 2, 2021 (the “Note Offerings”). The action asserts claims under §§ 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against the Company, certain of the Company's officers and directors, and the underwriters of the Note Offerings. The complaint alleges that defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including an alleged conspiracy to commit fraud. The Company believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend this action.



On January 24, 2024, a putative securities class action complaint was filed by Mike Coan in U.S. Federal District Court, Central District of California, against the Company, Bryant Riley, Tom Kelleher and Phillip Ahn (“Defendants”). The purported class includes persons and entities that purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges that (a) the Company failed to disclose to investors that (i) Brian Kahn, had been implicated in a conspiracy to defraud third party investors, and (ii) the Company financed Brian Kahn and others in connection with a going private transaction involving FRG, and (b) as a result of the foregoing, the Company engaged in securities fraud in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A second putative class action lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2024 by the KL Kamholz Joint Revocable Trust (“Kamholz”). This complaint asserts similar allegations as the Coan complaint and covers an alleged class period between February 28, 2022 and November 9, 2023. The Kamholz complaint further alleges that Defendants knew or should have known that Brian Kahn was engaged in illegal activities, including a conspiracy to commit fraud, and nonetheless proceeded with the FRG going-private transaction. The Company cannot estimate the amount of potential liability, if any, that could arise from these matters and believes these claims are meritless and intends to defend these actions.



On September 21, 2023, the Company received a demand alleging that certain payments in the aggregate amount of approximately $32,166 made by Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sorrento”), a chapter 11 debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas, to B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC (“BRCC”), pursuant to that certain Bridge Loan Agreement dated September 30, 2022 between Sorrento and BRCC, are avoidable as preferential transfers. The Company believes the Sorrento Unsecured Creditors Committee’s preference claims lack merit, and the Company intends to assert its statutory defenses to defeat the claim.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

These risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made.
