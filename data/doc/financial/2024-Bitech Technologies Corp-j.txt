NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report and in in our Form 10-K, and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Important factors that in our view could cause material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to, risks associated with service demands and acceptance, our ability to expand, changes in healthcare practices, changes in technology, economic conditions, the impact of competition and pricing, government regulation and approvals, impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 

As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Bitech Technologies Corporation (formerly Spine Injury Solutions, Inc.) and its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context indicates otherwise.

BITECH TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

Bitech Technologies Corporation (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. In connection with the Company’s planned expansion of its business following the completion of the acquisition of Bitech Mining Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (“Bitech Mining”), it filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2022 to change its corporate name to Bitech Technologies Corporation.

 

We have refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated to providing a suite of green energy solutions with plans to develop Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) projects, commercial and residential renewable energy solutions, enterprise utility services, public service engagements, and other renewable energy initiatives. We plan to pursue these innovative energy technologies through research and development, technology integration, planned acquisitions of other early stage green energy development projects and plans to become a grid-balancing operator using BESS solutions and applying new green technologies as a technology enabler in the green energy sector. Our team has identified two highly competitive battery energy storage suppliers who have expressed interest in establishing partnerships with us, as we seek to integrate their products into projects that we identify, including grid-balancing BESS projects we plan to pursue following the Business Combination with Bridgelink discussed in Note 6 – Subsequent Events. In addition, we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments, provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and implement innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological focuses on smart grid, Home Energy Management System (HEMS), Building Energy Management System (BEMS), City Energy Management System (CEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure.

 

The Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 (the “Closing Date”) through a share exchange pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, Bitech Mining, each of Bitech Mining’s shareholders (each, a “Seller” and collectively, the “Sellers”), and Benjamin Tran, solely in his capacity as Sellers’ Representative (“Sellers’ Representative”). The transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the “Share Exchange”). The Share Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will acquire from the Sellers, an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining (collectively, the “Bitech Mining Shares”). In consideration of the Bitech Mining Shares, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). Each Bitech Mining Share shall be entitled to receive 0.09543 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into 53.975685 shares (an aggregate of approximately 485,781,300) of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Company Common Stock”) upon filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company’s authorized common stock so that there are a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized but unissued to permit a full conversion of all the Series A Preferred Stock. Effective as of June 27, 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 485,781,168 shares of Company Common Stock following the June 27, 2022 filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company’s authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate, approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis.

 

The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical financial results.

 

Prior to March 31, 2022, we were engaged in the business of owning, developing and leasing the Quad Video Halo video recording system (“QVH”) used to record medical procedures including the collection of accounts receivables related to previously provided spine injury diagnostic services (collectively, the “QVH Business”). On June 30, 2022, we sold the assets related to the QVH Business.

 

NOTE 2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The following are summarized accounting policies considered to be critical by our management:

 

                                                                   8

Going Concern

 

Since our inception, our expenses substantially exceeded our revenue, resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.2 million as of March 31, 2024. Presently, we are trying to limit all operating expenses as much as possible. If in the future we decide to increase our service development, marketing efforts and/or brand building activities, we will need to increase our operating expenses and our general and administrative functions to support such growth in operations. No such growth in operations is presently planned. We are also actively seeking to acquire a private company with which to enter into a strategic business transaction, including without limitation a merger; however, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of our efforts. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to successfully merge with a financially viable company, or our ability to obtain additional capital from borrowing and/or selling securities, as needed, to fund our operations. There is no assurance that additional capital can be obtained or that it can be obtained on terms that are favorable to us and our existing stockholders. Any expectation of future profitability is likely dependent upon our ability to successfully merge with another company, of which there can be no assurances.

 

We were not involved in any procedures in 2024 and have no plans to do so in the future. The previous service revenues earned has resulted in longer settlement times, which has created a slowdown in cash collections.

 

Basis of Consolidation

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bitech Technologies Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bitech Mining Corporation and Quad Video Halo, Inc. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

Revenue recognition

 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.

 

We have assessed the impact of the guidance by performing the following five steps analysis:

 

Step 1: Identify the contract

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price

Step 5: Recognize revenue

 

Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing equipment. The Company considers a signed lease agreement to be a contract with a customer. Contracts with customers are considered to be short-term when the time between signed agreements and satisfaction of the performance obligations is equal to or less than one year, and virtually all of the Company’s contracts are short-term. The Company recognizes revenue when services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations in contracts with customers upon delivery of the services. The Company does not have any contract assets since we have an unconditional right to consideration when we have satisfied its performance obligation and payment from customers is not contingent on a future event. Generally, payment is due from customers immediately at the invoice date, and the contracts do not have significant financing components nor variable consideration. There are no returns and there is no allowances. All of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and the transaction price is stated in the contract, usually as a price per unit. All estimates are based on the Company’s historical experience, complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, and the Company’s best judgment at the time the estimate is made.

 

                                                                   9

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable as reflected in the consolidated financial statements, approximates fair value. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. We maintain cash and cash equivalents in banks which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on these deposits.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are carried at cost. When retired or otherwise disposed of, the related carrying cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and the net difference, less any amount realized from the disposition, is recorded in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Costs of significant improvements and renewals are capitalized.

 

Property and equipment consist of computers and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of three years, using the straight-line method.

 

Long-Lived Assets

 

We periodically review and evaluate long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. In performing our review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of such assets and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of such assets over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

Assets that expose us to credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable arise from a diversified customer base and, therefore, we believe the concentration of credit risk is minimal. We evaluate the creditworthiness of customers before any services are provided. We record a discount based on the nature of our business, collection trends, and an assessment of our ability to fully realize amounts billed for services. We have no accounts receivable to warrant any allowance at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.

 

Stock Based Compensation

 

We account for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, based on estimated fair values. Under authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), companies are required to estimate the fair value or calculated value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. We use the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards. During the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized stock based compensation expenses of $94,300 and $64,000, respectively.

 

Income Taxes

 

We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.

 

                                                                   10

Uncertain Tax Positions

 

Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” Topic 740-10-25 defines the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent). Under ASC Topic 740-10-25, the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained.

 

We are subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters. When applicable, we will adjust tax expense to reflect our ongoing assessments of such matters which require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective rate as well as impact operating results.

 

Under ASC Topic 740-10-25, only the portion of the liability that is expected to be paid within one year is classified as a current liability. As a result, liabilities expected to be resolved without the payment of cash (e.g. resolution due to the expiration of the statute of limitations) or are not expected to be paid within one year are not classified as current. Estimated interest and penalties are recognized as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized no estimated interest or penalties as income tax expense.

 

Legal Costs and Contingencies

 

In the normal course of business, we incur costs to hire and retain external legal counsel to advise us on regulatory, litigation and other matters. We expense these costs as the related services are received.

 

If a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. If we have the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, we make a separate assessment of recoverability and reduce the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.

 

Net Loss per Share

 

Basic and diluted net loss per common share is presented in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share,” for all periods presented. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, common stock equivalents from outstanding stock options and warrants have been excluded from the calculation of the diluted loss per share in the consolidated statements of operations, because all such securities were anti-dilutive. The net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and, instead, requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, ASU No. 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to amend the effective date for entities that had not yet adopted ASU No. 2016-13. Accordingly, the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early application permitted in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-13 should be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Management is currently evaluating the future impact of ASU No. 2016-13 on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 52,000,000, and 42,000,000 options outstanding, respectively.

 

We have granted non-qualified stock options to employees and contractors.

Options may be exercised up to ten years following the date of the grant, with vesting schedules determined by us upon grant. Vesting schedules vary by grant, with some fully vesting immediately upon grant to others that ratably vest over a period of time up to five years. Standard vested options may be exercised up to three months following date of termination of the relationship unless alternate terms are specified at grant. The fair values of options are determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of options is recognized as expense on the straight-line basis over the options’ vesting periods. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $340,707 unrecognized stock-based compensation.

NOTE 5. ACQUISITION OF BITECH MINING

 

On March 31, 2022, the Company acquired 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining’s Common Stock representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining in exchange for 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock.

 

The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical financial results.

 

The Combination of the Company and Bitech Mining is considered a business acquisition and the method used to present the transaction is the acquisition method. The acquisition method is a method of accounting for a merger of two businesses. The tangible assets and liabilities and operations of the acquired business were combined at their market value of the acquisition date, which is the date when the acquirer gains control over the acquired company.

 

The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Bitech Mining and the fair value amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date:

NOTE 6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

On April 14, 2024, the Company, Emergen Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Emergen”), Bridgelink Development, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Bridgelink”) and C & C Johnson Holdings LLC, the sole member of Bridgelink (“C&C”) entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) (the “Business Combination”).

 

On April 24, 2024, the Company, Emergen, Bridgelink and C&C entered into Amendment No. 1 to the MIPA (the “Amendment”) to amend Section 2.02(b)(i) of the MIPA which provides that instead of expanding the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to five persons upon the closing of the Business Combination, the size of the Board will be expanded to four persons and name Cole Johnson to the Board as of the date of closing of the Business Combination. In addition, Amendment No. 1 requires the Company to expand the size of the Board to five persons, and thereafter to name to the Board two persons as named by the Company, two persons as named by Bridgelink, and one person jointly selected by the Company and Bridgelink, which person shall meet the requirements of being an “independent director” pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

 

On April 24, 2024 (the “Closing”) the Company completed the acquisition of Emergen pursuant to the MIPA whereby the Company issued 222,222,000 unregistered shares of its common stock to Emergen’s sole member, C&C, an entity controlled by Cole Johnson who became an executive officer and director of the Company following the Closing, in exchange for 100% of Emergen’s equity interests. Following the Closing, Mr. Johnson became the President of the Company’s BESS and Solar Divisions and a member of the Board. In addition, Emergen became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with C&C’s ownership interest in the Company being approximately 31.3% based on 711,090,664 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding after giving effect to the issuance of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the MIPA.

 

Emergen holds certain contractual and other rights to develop a portfolio of battery energy storage system (“BESS”) projects identified in the MIPA with a cumulative storage capacity estimated at 1.965 gigawatts (GW) upon completion of the construction of such project (the “BESS Development Projects”) and rights to develop a portfolio of solar energy development projects with a cumulative capacity estimated at 3.840 GW upon completion of construction of such project (the “Solar Development Projects,” together with the BESS Development Projects, collectively, the “Development Projects”). Following the Closing, the Company will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to uplist the Company to the NASDAQ stock exchange.

 

                                                                   13

The following agreements were entered into on the date of Closing as provided for in the MIPA:

 

Project Management Services Agreement

 

At the Closing, the Company and Emergen entered into a Project Management Services Agreement (the “PMSA”) with Energy Independent Partners LLC (“Energy Independent Partners”), an entity owned or controlled by Mr. Johnson. Pursuant to the terms of the PMSA, Energy Independent Partners is obligated to provide the following project management services in connection with the development and operation of each of the Development Projects (collectively, the “Services”): (i) assist as needed with qualifying the Development Projects for financing; (ii) assist as needed with obtaining all permits required for development of the Development Projects which have sufficient rights to use all necessary real property, and for which the applicable draft interconnection agreement has been received for the Development Projects (“RTB Status”); and (iii) if Emergen foregoes the development of a Development Project, Energy Independent Partners will assist the Company as needed with marketing the Development Project to a third party or develop and retain the Development Project outside of Emergen.

 

The term of the PMSA (the “Term”) commenced on the date of the Closing (the “Effective Date”) and terminates on the earlier to occur of (i) all of the Development Projects reaching RTB Status or being sold to a third party; and (ii) the mutual written agreement of the Parties to the PMSA to terminate the PMSA.

 

Payment for Service. The Issuer agreed to pay Energy Independent Partners the following fees for providing the Services:

 

BESS Development Fees. The sum of (i) $9,825,000 for prior actions of affiliates of Energy Independent Partners with respect to the BESS Development Projects (the “BESS Initial Fee”); and (ii) $0.03 per watt for each applicable BESS Development Project, subject to such BESS Development Project achieving RTB Status (as to each BESS Development Project, the “BESS RTB Fee”). The BESS Initial Fee and the BESS RTB Fees are referred to collectively as the “BESS Development Fees”.

 

Solar Development Fees. The sum of (i) $19,200,000 for prior actions of affiliates of Energy Independent Partners with respect to the Solar Development Projects (the “Solar Initial Fee”); and (ii) $0.03 per watt for each applicable Solar Development Project, subject to such Solar Development Project achieving RTB Status (as to each Solar Development Project, the “Solar RTB Fee”). The Solar Initial Fee and the Solar RTB Fees are referred to collectively as the “Solar Development Fees”.

 

Other Development Fees. For each other renewable energy development asset held by the Company, which are neither BESS Development Projects nor Solar Development Projects, located in the United States in which the Company engages during the term of the PMSA (the “Other Development Projects”), the Company shall pay Energy Independent Partners the higher of either (a) fifty percent (50%) of the gross margin or (b) $0.02 per watt in cash, subject to such Other Development Project achieving RTB Status (the “Other Development Fees”).

 

Timing of Payment of Fees

 

The BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee shall not be due or payable until the Company has completed one or more financings which have resulted in the Company receiving net proceeds of at least $5,000,000, and at such time 15% of the proceeds from each such financing shall be used to make payment on the BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee, to be apportioned equally between the two. Thereafter, 15% of any additional proceeds of financings shall similarly be used to make payment on the BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee, to be apportioned equally between the two, until the BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee have been paid in full. In the event that the BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee have been not paid in full from the 15% of the proceeds of such financings, any remaining portions of the BESS Initial Fee and the Solar Initial Fee shall be due and payable on the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Date.

 

Subject to achievement of RTB Status for each applicable BESS Development Project and certain other limitations provided for in the PMSA, the BESS RTB Fees shall be payable at the time that the Company has obtained project financing with respect to the applicable BESS Development Project to be able to pay such BESS RTB Fees. Subject to achievement of RTB Status for each applicable Solar Development Project and certain other limitations provided for in the PMSA, the Solar RTB Fees shall be payable at the time that the Company has obtained project financing with respect to the applicable Solar Development Project to be able to pay such Solar RTB Fees.

 

The timing and other requirements for the payment of Other Development Fees shall be as agreed in writing by the parties to the PMSA via an addendum to the PMSA prior to the parties undertaking such Other Development Projects.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the PMSA, in addition to the other requirements therein, payment of the BESS RTB Fees, the Solar RTB Fees and any Other Development Fees is further contingent upon Cole W. Johnson (a) remaining an employee or consultant to Emergen and/or the head of the BESS and Solar Division of the Company and/or (b) as an interest owner in the Energy Independent Partners during the period of time in which the applicable BESS RTB Fees, the Solar RTB Fees or Other Development Fees are payable. Subject to the foregoing, the BESS RTB Fees, the Solar RTB Fees or Other Development Fees are payable within ten (10) days of satisfaction of the conditions to payment as discussed above.

 

Payment for Sale of Development Projects. In the event the Company decides not to proceed with any Development Project(s), the Company may elect to sell such Development Project(s) to one or more third parties. In such event, the Company and Energy Independent Partners agree to a sales price for the applicable Development Project being sold, and provided that the parties to the PMSA agree that any sale agreement for such Development Projects shall provide that the buyer thereof shall remain obligated to pay to Energy Independent Partners the BESS Development Fees and/or the Soler Development Fee(s), as applicable, to the extent not already paid by the Company hereunder, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Company and Energy Independent Partners.

 

                                                                   14

Termination. The PMSA may be terminated at any time prior to the expiration of its term: (a) by the mutual written consent of the parties; (b) by the Company if Energy Independent Partners has violated or breached any of the covenants or agreements of Energy Independent Partners set forth therein, or any of the representations or warranties of Energy Independent Partners set forth in the PMSA has become inaccurate or untrue, which violation, breach, inaccuracy or untruth, if reasonable capable of cure, has not been cured by Energy Independent Partners, within 20 business days after receipt by Energy Independent Partners of written notice thereof from the Company; (c) by Energy Independent Partners if the Company or Emergen has violated or breached any of the covenants or agreements of the Company or Emergen set forth in the PMSA, or any of the representations or warranties of the Company or Emergen set forth in the PMSA has become inaccurate or untrue, which violation, breach, inaccuracy or untruth, if reasonable capable of cure, has not been cured by the Company or Emergen, within 20 business days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from Energy Independent Partners; or (d) by any party, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Combination or the transactions contemplated by the PMSA and such order or action shall have become final and nonappealable. Any of the Parties has a right to seek specific performance of the other parties’ obligations under the PMSA in lieu of its right to terminate the agreement.

The Employment Agreements all provide for a term of five years that may be terminated by the Company for death or disability and with or without cause, by the executive with or without good reason, or mutually terminated by the parties.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

This management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of Bitech Technologies Corporation (the “Company,” “Bitech Technologies,” “our” or “we”) is for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. It is supplemental to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and the accompanying notes for such period included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on April 4, 2022. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Financial information presented in this MD&A is presented in United States dollars (“$” or “US$”), unless otherwise indicated.

 

The information about us provided in this MD&A, including information incorporated by reference, may contain “forward-looking statements” and certain “forward-looking information” as defined under applicable United States securities laws and Canadian securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, made by us that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements preceded by, followed by or that include words such as “may”, “will”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “believes”, “estimates”, “projects”, “potential”, “expects”, “plans”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “targeted”, “continues”, “forecasts”, “designed”, “goal”, or the negative of those words or other similar or comparable words and includes, among others, information regarding: our ability to become profitable and generate cash in our operating activities; our need for substantial additional financing to operate our business and difficulties we may face acquiring additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all; our significant indebtedness and significant restrictions on our operations; the risk that the BESS and Solar Development Projects discussed below (the “Development Projects”) may not be completed, will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected or that the Company is otherwise unable to successfully complete the Development Projects; (iii) the failure to obtain the necessary approvals and consents to complete the Development Projects, regulatory, or any other consents required to complete the projects; our ability to obtain required governmental approvals to complete the Development Projects (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the Company or the expected benefits of the Business Combination discussed below); the Company’s ability to fund the costs required to complete the Development Projects; the impact of global climate change on our ability to conduct future operations; our dependence on key inputs, suppliers and skilled labor to complete construction of the Development Projects and acquire equipment for the operation of the proposed Development Projects; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; growth-related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and controls; risk related to the protection of our intellectual property and our exposure to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties; risks related to competition; risks related to our lack of internal controls over financial reporting and their effectiveness; increased costs we are subject to as a result of being a public company in the United States; and other events or conditions that may occur in the future.

 

Forward-looking statements may relate to future financial conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance or business developments. These statements speak only as at the date they are made and are based on information currently available and on the then current expectations of the party making the statement and assumptions concerning future events, which are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from that which was expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors.”

 

Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements, because no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature, they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to the risks described in “Risk Factors.”

 

                                                                   16

Consequently, all forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and other documents, as applicable, are qualified by such cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the anticipated results or developments will actually be realized or, even if realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on us. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we and/or persons acting on its behalf may issue. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required under securities legislation.

 

Overview of the Business

 

Currently, we have refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated to providing a suite of green energy solutions with plans to develop Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) projects, commercial and residential renewable energy solutions, enterprise utility services, public service engagements, and other renewable energy initiatives. We plan to pursue these innovative energy technologies and become a grid-balancing operator by developing a portfolio of battery energy storage system (“BESS”) projects with a cumulative storage capacity estimated at 1.965 gigawatts (“GW”) and rights to develop a portfolio of solar energy development projects with a cumulative capacity estimated at 3.840 GW (collectively, the “Development Projects”) that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Emergen Energy LLC (“Emergen”). See Note 6 – Subsequent Events to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We plan to raise the working capital we need to commence the Development Projects. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition, our team has identified two highly competitive battery energy storage suppliers who have expressed interest in establishing partnerships with us, as we seek to integrate their products into our recently acquired Development Projects. In addition, we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments, provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and implement innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological focuses on smart grid, Home Energy Management System (HEMS), Building Energy Management System (BEMS), City Energy Management System (CEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure.

 

To accelerate growth of a planned intellectual property (IP) portfolio through acquisition strategies, we plan to execute our Smart Acquisition Model with selected acquisitions of defensible technologies accompanied with visionary management teams who can demonstrate a common goal with us in order to unlock the full potential with capital infusion, accelerate growth. To achieve our development plans, we plan to incubate those acquired companies toward foreseeable plans for mergers and acquisitions, formation of global joint ventures, while facilitating new market entry to today’s fastest growing Southeast Asia region. With this acquisition model, we expect to build a valuable technology portfolio of IP assets in various innovative green energy technologies, leveraging our network of global capital partners with low-cost manufacturing capacity and oversea outsourcing technical talents from our niche sources in Vietnam.

 

Further, we plan to execute a Dual Growth Business Model encompassing (1) IP portfolio growth which includes technology licensing or technology acquisitions, enhanced with our plans to carry out research and development for specific applications, and (2) sustainable revenue growth by executing planned BESS acquisitions via joint ventures with capital partners to collect joint venture income from BESS operations or Vietnam-based manufacturing partners which can manufacture products derived from our technology solutions.

 

In light of these initiatives and other reasons noted below, the Company has, however, elected to discontinue its efforts to commercialize the electric power generation and charging system (the “Tesdison Technology”) it licensed from SuperGreen pursuant to the SuperGreen License. The Company has determined that the Tesdison Technology was not functional nor was it capable of being developed into a commercially viable product as had been represented to the Company by SuperGreen, its founder Calvin Cao, and his brother Michael Cao, leading up to Bitech Mining entering into the SuperGreen License. In addition, the Company will temporarily pause the further development of Intellisys-8, the Company’s planned chipset and related software that had been designed to reduce power consumption and heat in computer systems and accelerate their computational speed due to the currently unfavorable market conditions within the cryptocurrency market.

 

The Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement we acquired an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining’s Common Stock representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining in exchange for an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Effective June 27, 2022, each share of Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 53.975685 shares (an aggregate of 485,781,168) of the Company’s Common Stock upon filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company’s authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate, approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis.

 

                                                                   17



Table of Contents

 

The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical financial results.

 

Comparison of the three month period ended March 31, 2024 with the three month period ended March 31, 2023.

 

The Company has generated minimal revenues from its primary business for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred $313,835 of general and administrative expenses compared to $239,079 for the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses have been mostly consistent during 2024 compared to 2023 as the Company moves from development stage to revenue generation.

 

As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of ($313,507) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of ($232,079) which included $7,000 other income to offset the general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Working Capital

 

The calculation of Working Capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. We define Working Capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity.

 

Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total current liabilities of $53,557 and $35,229, respectively, and current assets of $242,037 and $163,417, respectively, to meet our current obligations. As of March 31, 2024, we had working capital of $188,480, an increase of working capital of $60,292 as compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by cash provided by financing offset by cash used in operations.

 

                                                                   18



Table of Contents

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operations was ($166,379) which primarily included the net loss of ($313,507) primarily offset by $94,300 of non-cash restricted stock awards and option valuation recorded as stock compensation and $23,499 common stock issued for services.

 

We have a history of operating losses. We have not yet achieved profitable operations and expect to incur further losses. We have funded our operations primarily from equity financing. As of March 31, 2024, cash generated from financing activities was not sufficient to fund our growth strategy in the short-term or long-term. The primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of the business, including operational and development costs to develop and construct our planned BESS and Solar projects that are part of the Development Project rights we acquired upon completion of the acquisition of Emergen. As the Development Projects are in their early phase of development, we have not determined the amount of capital needed to complete their development or operate them until sufficient cash is generated from their operations. The primary source of liquidity has primarily been private financing transactions. The ability to fund operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to execute on the development and commercialization of the Development Projects depends on our ability to raise funds from debt and/or equity financing which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results of operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources.

 

Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Practices

 

There were no material changes in or adoption of new accounting practices during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. Such officers have concluded (based upon their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report) that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this report is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have also indicated that, upon evaluation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or other factors during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 

                                                                   20

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, to our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings or regulatory actions material to us to which we are a party, or have been a party to, or of which any of our property is or was the subject matter of, and no such proceedings or actions are known by us to be contemplated except as provided below:

 

Due to the misrepresentations and omissions of SuperGreen, Calvin C. Cao and Michael H. Cao, among other reasons, the Company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California on February 2, 2023 against SuperGreen, Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, Calvin C. Cao and entities affiliated with them alleging fraud-concealment, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty-duty of good faith, breach of fiduciary duty-undivided loyalty, conversion and violation of California Penal Code Sec. 496 (the “Cao Lawsuit”). This lawsuit seeks compensatory damages of at least $33.6 million, treble and punitive damages, imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants assets, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, attorney’s fees and such other relief as determined by the court.

 

Effective February 20, 2023, the Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiary Bitech Mining Corporation entered into a Confidential Settlement, Mutual Release, and Share Transfer Agreement (the “C. Cao Settlement Agreement”) with Calvin Cao (“C. Cao”) and SuperGreen Energy Corporation (“SuperGreen,” together with C. Cao, the “C. Cao Parties”). The C. Cao Settlement Agreement settles as to the C. Cao Parties, the Cao Lawsuit. Pursuant to the C. Cao Settlement Agreement, the C. Cao Parties terminated the Patent & Technology Exclusive and Non-Exclusive License Agreement between Bitech Mining Corporation and SuperGreen dated January 15, 2021 as amended on January 15, 2021 and on March 26, 2022 (the “License Agreement”) and SuperGreen canceled 51,507,749 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share issued by the Company to SuperGreen pursuant to the License Agreement. In addition, the parties to the Settlement Agreement agreed to a mutual general release of liabilities against each other, refrain from making any disparaging remarks about each other and the Company’s filing a dismissal with prejudice of the Cao Lawsuit as to the C. Cao Parties. The Settlement Agreement also contains additional covenants, representations and warranties that are customary of litigation settlement agreements.

 

On March 6, 2023, Michael Cao and Linh Dao filed, without an attorney, a pro se Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction.

 

On April 17, 2023, the court dismissed the Cao Lawsuit without prejudice due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On April 18, 2023, we filed a complaint against Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, B & B Investment Holding, LLC (“B & B Investment”) and Cory Thomason in the Orange County California Superior Court containing substantially the same allegations included in the Cao Lawsuit filed in federal court (the “Cao State Court Lawsuit”). We served Mr. Cao, Ms. Dao and B & B Investment Holding, LLC on April 26, 2023 and are continuing efforts to serve Mr. Thomason. Defendants Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, B & B Investment (pro se) filed a Motion to Quash Service of Summons; Motion to Dismiss or Stay Complaint (the “B & B Motions”). In response to this motion, the Company filed a Motion to Strike B & B Investment’s motion (the “Motion to Strike”), Request for Sanctions in Amount of $2,400 and Request for Default as to B & B Investment because it is being impermissibly represented by Michael H. Cao who is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law as to a corporate entity. On October 13, 2023, the Court granted in part the Company’s unopposed Motion to Strike, striking the B & B Investment Motions and ordering B &B Investment to retain an attorney no later than October 27, 2023 or be subject to default because corporate entities are not permitted to appear in court without an attorney. The Court denied Mr. Cao’s Motion to Quash and took Linh Dao’s Motion to Quash off calendar, thus keeping all Defendants in the case. The Court ruled that Michael Cao already waived his rights to file such a motion by making a general appearance in the case and noted that Defendants failed to appear at the hearing. On or about October 27, 2023, the Company’s counsel received an initial communication from an attorney attaching responses to the Company’s complaint on behalf of Mr. Cao and B&B Investment. On November 27, 2023, Mr. Cao and B&B Investment filed a Demurrer to the Complaint and Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint. These responses to the Company’s Complaint, along with the motions filed by Mr. Cao pro se, were heard on May 10, 2024. The Company filed Oppositions to each of these motions. A Case Management Conference occurred on May 10, 2024. The Company will be supplying additional facts and supporting documentation as requested by the court.

 

Mr. Cao served initial responses to our discovery requests, but we believed these responses were evasive and asserted unnecessary objections. After attempting to meet and confer with Mr. Cao, we filed motions to compel further responses to our discovery requests which were heard on December 8, 2023. The Court granted in part and denied in part our motions. Accordingly, Mr. Cao served supplemental responses and provided responsive documents, which we have deemed sufficient.

 

The Company intends to vigorously prosecute the Cao State Court Lawsuit. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit, however.

 

Litigation Assessment

 

We have evaluated the foregoing Cao Lawsuit to assess the likelihood of any unfavorable outcome and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential loss as it relates to the litigation. Based on this assessment and estimate, which includes an understanding of our intention to vigorously prosecute the Cao Lawsuit, we believe that the potential defenses of any of the remaining defendants lack merit, however, and we cannot predict the likelihood of any recoveries by any of our claims against the remaining defendants. This assessment and estimate is based on the information available to management as of the date of this Annual Report and involves a significant amount of management judgment, including the inherent difficulty associated with assessing litigation matters in their early stages. As a result, the actual outcome or loss may differ materially from those envisioned by the current assessment and estimate. Our failure to successfully prosecute, defend or settle the Cao Litigation with the remaining defendants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.

 

                                                                   21
