BOXABL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1- INCORPORATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

 

Description of Business

 

BOXABL Inc., is a Nevada (“C”) corporation originally organized as a Nevada limited liability company, on December 2, 2017. The corporation converted from a Nevada limited liability company to a Nevada corporation on June 16, 2020. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated audited financial statements of BOXABL Inc., (which may be referred to as the “Company”, “BOXABL”, “we”, “us” or “our”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s headquarters are in Las Vegas, Nevada.

 

BOXABL Inc., is developing a new type of building system using modern manufacturing processes. Its products result in sustainable high-quality buildings at lower cost, benefiting from mass production practices, resolving the problems of housing shortages by offering a quick solution, and reducing the carbon footprint. The Company has also developed patented shipping technology, allowing it to serve large geographic areas from one factory.

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Boxabl Inc. (the” Company”) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 500 Group from June 15, 2023. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.

 

The financial data presented herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 

Except as otherwise stated, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars, indicated by a “K”.

 

Prior Period Reclassification

 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

 

  (i) The Company reflected an additional 224K shares of Series A-1 preferred stock, resulting in additional paid-in-capital of $14K.

  

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These estimates form the basis for judgements the Company makes about the carrying values of its assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, including historical information and various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

 

Risks and Uncertainties

 

The Company’s business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the US and worldwide along with local, state, and federal governmental policy decisions. A host of factors beyond the Company’s control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse conditions may include recession, downturn or otherwise, government policies. These adverse conditions could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of its operations and cash flows.

 

                                                                   7



 

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:

 

          ●         Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets

                     consist of

                     investments.

          ●         Level 2 – Valuations based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted

                     prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and

                     liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by

                     observable market

                     data.

          ●         Level 3 – Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably

                     available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. The

                     Company valued its employee stock options (NQSO’s and ISO’s) and stock grants (RSU’s) at grant date fair value

                     using a Level 3 mark. See Note 9 – Stockholders Equity (Deficit): Stock Based

                     Compensation.

 

Restricted Cash and Deposits

 

On June 1, 2023, the Company was required to obtain a letter of credit to make a Security Deposit related to the expansion of premises of $3,714K. The letter of credit is collateralized by cash in the Company’s bank account, which is restricted from use until the Letter of Credit is settled. The interest earned on this cash account is also restricted for use until the Letter of Credit is settled. On January 31, 2024, the Company also paid an additional security deposit of $258K for additional tenant improvements to its existing facility.  

 

Marketable Debt Securities

 

The Company generally invests its excess cash into Marketable debt securities, which consist of short-term and long-term investments in US treasury bills and notes that are classified as held-to-maturity.

 

Short-Term Investments in U.S. Treasury Notes, Held-to-Maturity

 

Short-term investments in U.S. treasury notes include U.S Treasury notes with maturities of less than 12 months. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments in US treasury notes are determined using the specific identification method. If a US treasury note has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we will record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security.

 

Long-Term Investments in U.S. Treasury Notes, Held-to-Maturity

 

Long-term investments in U.S. treasury notes include U.S Treasury notes with maturities of 12 months or more. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on long-term investments in US treasury notes are determined using the specific identification method. If a US treasury note has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we will record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory consists of raw materials, in-bound freight and duties, work in progress, and finished goods. Inventories available for sale are valued at the lower of cost or net realized value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, bulk sales, and the expected recoverable values for each disposition category. On a periodic basis, the Company performs a physical count of its inventory and records an Inventory Valuation Allowance for inventory that has become obsolete or inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value. Damaged and obsolete inventory are valued based on management’s best estimate and any difference charged to expense.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major improvements with economic lives greater than one year are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

 SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Software, computers and other peripheral equipment                  3 years

Furniture and fixtures                                              7 years

Machinery and equipment                                             5-15 years

Tenant improvements                                                 2-5 years

Vehicles                                                            5 years

Casita fixed assets                                                 25 years

 

                                                                   8



 

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets are amortized over the respective estimated lives on a straight-line basis unless the lives are determined to be indefinite and reviewed for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company’s intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of 14 years, or the stated expiration date, whichever is more determinable.

 

Revenue

 

Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by allowance for estimated returns, chargebacks, promotional discounts, markdowns, and rebates based on Management’s estimates and the Company’s historical experience. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.

 

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

 

-         Identification of a contract with a customer.

           

-         Identification of the performance obligations in the contract.

           

-         Determination of the transaction price.

           

-         The customer has the ability and intent to pay the contractual amount.

           

-         Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.

           

-         Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Revenues are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of “Boxes,” services or parts to the Company’s customers. Generally, control transfers upon shipment of the Casita to the customer and considers the transfer of legal title and risk and rewards of ownership to the Customer. Occasionally, performance obligations for the Company may also include the delivery, installation and other services. The Company records a liability for customer deposits received prior to delivery of the Casita or fulfilment of the service. The liability is relieved, with revenue being recognized once the performance obligations to the customer are satisfied.

 

Cost of Goods Sold

 

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of products used in the production of the Company’s finished products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, the related labor, and indirect overhead costs associated with that production.

 

On a periodic basis, the Company performs a physical count of its inventory and records an Inventory Valuation Allowance for inventory that has become obsolete or inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value. Damaged and obsolete inventory are valued based on management’s best estimate and any difference charged to expense.

 

Advertising and Promotion

 

The Company incurs third party advertising costs as well as payroll-related costs for its marketing personnel engaged in promotional activities. Advertising and promotion costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred. Certain marketing costs related to the issuance of the Company’s securities are accounted for as a reduction to the proceeds from the equity offering, and not included in sales and marketing expense.

 

                                                                   9



 

 

Research and Development

 

Research and development costs consisting of design, materials, and consultants related to prototype and process improvements and developments are expensed as incurred.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

 

The Company classifies all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Due to the maturity of cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values. Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at high quality financial institutions. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s deposits exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limit. The Company has not experienced any losses with respect to its cash balances. Based upon assessment of the financial condition of these institutions, management considers that the risk of loss of any uninsured balances do not have a significant impact on the Company’s operations.

 

Customers:

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, revenues from four customers were approximately 90% and revenues from two customers were 100% of the Company’s revenues, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, receivables from one customer represented 100% and 100% of the Company’s accounts receivable, respectively. The Company does not have repeating customers so the loss of an individual customer is not expected to impact the Company’s operations.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company uses ASC 718 for Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation for all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the associated vesting periods. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated on the date of the grant based on the fair value of the Company’s underlying common stock. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the associated service or vesting periods.

 

Determining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and, if different assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from the amounts recorded.

 

Contingencies

 

The Company is involved in lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450 Contingencies, the Company will make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. The Company reviews these provisions in conjunction with any related provisions on assets related to the claims at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of leg al counsel and other pertinent information related to the case. Should developments in any of these matters outlined below cause a change in the Company’s determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material provision, or, should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, and financial position in the period or periods in which such a change in determination, settlement or judgment occurs.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share

 

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares subject to redemption or forfeiture. Diluted net loss per share reflects the actual weighted average of common shares issued and outstanding during the period plus potential common shares. Stock options and convertible instruments are considered potential common shares and are included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. As all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented as a result of the net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for each period.

 

The following table summarizes potentially dilutive securities, and the resulting common share equivalents outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Warranty Provision

 

The Company offers its customers warranties on products sold for a period of up to 10 years. Management records an expense to operations for the costs of warranty repairs at the time of sale. Management’s estimate for warranties is based on sales levels and historical costs of providing warranties As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s reserve for warranty totaled $570K and $570K, respectively, and is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. 

 

On December 14, 2023 the FASB issued a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.

 

For public business entities (PBEs), the new requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business entities (non-PBEs), the requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 2 –MANAGEMENT’S PLAN

 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will be able to continue its operations and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $12,051K, an operating cash outflow of $10,391K, and an accumulated deficit of $679,537K as of March 31, 2024.

 

The continuing viability of the Company and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company being successful in its continued efforts in growing its revenue and/or accessing additional sources of capital. Management’s plan to address this need includes (a) continued exercise of tight controls to conserve cash, (b) accelerating sales of Casitas to generate revenue, and (c) raising funds through equity financing. The Company anticipates current capital on hand and expected future funding will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations in excess of twelve months. There are no assurances that our plans will be successful. The Company is currently selling shares through Regulation D and anticipates raising funds through other offerings of preferred stock.

NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

 

On June 15, 2023, the Company engaged in an all-stock statutory merger with 500 Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“500 Group”) and its subsidiary Build IP. The Company exchanged 37,500K shares of its Non-Voting Series A-2 Preferred Stock for 500 Group’s 100 outstanding shares of 500 Group’s common stock in a transaction valued at $30,000K, or $0.80 per share. Due to the common control of the Company, 500 Group and Build IP by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, this transaction was accounted for under the common control accounting standards. In addition, 500 Group and Build IP didn’t have substantial assets, liabilities or operations. Thus, the Company treated the transaction as an asset acquisition, recording $272K as intangible assets, which represented the patents at its historical carrying value, and the remaining consideration of $29,725K as a deemed dividend. The deemed dividend was offset against the Series A-2 Preferred Stock account as the Company currently has an accumulated deficit. As a result of this merger, 500 Group and Build IP are wholly-owned by BOXABL, and their assets, including the intellectual property held by Build IP, are now owned and consolidated by BOXABL. Accordingly, license agreement between BOXABL and Build IP is now void. This asset acquisition enabled BOXABL to control the intellectual property previous contracted for under the license agreement that required payment of a 1% royalty fee based on gross revenues.

 

Intellectual Property

 

The Company recorded intellectual property of $272K at the time of the merger valued at historical cost. The balance of the intellectual property as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $398K and $398K, respectively. The Company also recorded amortization expense related to these patents of $9K and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $89K and $80K, respectively. The useful life of the patents is either the stated expiration date, or 14 years, whichever is more easily determined.

 

NOTE 7 –LEASES

 

On December 29, 2020, the Company signed a 65-month lease for their 173,000 sq. ft. factory facility, commencing on May 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, a $525,000 security deposit, first month’s rent, $87K, and first-month’s Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expense Fees (“CAM”) $19K, have been paid to the landlord. The monthly CAM will vary from month to month. After March 31, 2023, the Company amended the lease agreement to obtain additional space in a neighboring warehouse for four years, with the first month’s base rent of $116K, increasing by 4% annually.

 

On June 10, 2022, the Company signed a 73-month lease for a 132,960 sq. ft warehouse, commencing the earlier of (a) 30 days after substantial completion of tenant work by the landlord or (b) tenant commencing operation in the building. The lease commencement date was determined to be February 1, 2023. The initial base rent is $104K and CAM is $19K. The base rent will increase 4% every year.

 

Pursuant to an agreement dated April 12, 2023, but effective as of January 1, 2023, the Company will lease to Supercar System four support squares located in the Company’s main property located at 5435 E. N. Belt Road, Las Vegas, Nevada for $7,409 per month. The agreement terminates December 31, 2026, unless otherwise amended in writing by the parties, and the Company retains the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement upon thirty days’ written notice. Supercar System is controlled by the Company’s CEO, Paolo Tiramani.

 

The Company recognizes lease expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term. The Company has determined that it was reasonably certain that the renewal options would be exercised based on previous history and knowledge, current understanding of future business needs and the level of investment in leasehold improvements, among other considerations. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the lease liability is based on the rate available to the Company. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Certain subsidiaries of the Company rent or sublease certain office space to/from other subsidiaries of the Company.

 

                                                                   13



 

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term was 3.6 years and 3.8 years, respectively. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate is 5.2%.

 

No ROU asset is recorded for leases with a lease term, including any reasonably assured renewal terms, of 12 months or less. Upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company also recorded lease liabilities computed as the present value of future minimum lease payments, including reductions from any landlord incentives, plus any additional direct costs from executing the leases. Lease liabilities are amortized using the effective interest method using a discount rate of 4%. Depreciation on the ROU asset is calculated as the difference between the expected straight-line rent expense over the lease term less the accretion on the lease liability. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for these operating leases in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s lease agreements also include obligations for the Company to pay for other services, including operations and maintenance. The Company accounts for these services separately.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, rent expenses totaled $971K and $596K, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 the Company performed improvements to the leased facility that required the accrual of an asset retirement obligation to restore the property to its original condition at the end of the lease. In connection with this improvement, the landlord required the Company to make an additional security deposit of $258K.

 

Sublease

 

Effective as of January 1, 2023, the Company leased to Supercar System four support squares located in the Company’s main property located at 5435 E. N. Belt Road, Las Vegas, Nevada for $7K per month. The agreement terminates December 31, 2026 unless otherwise amended in writing by the parties, and the Company retains the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement upon thirty days’ written notice. Supercar System is controlled by the Company’s CEO, Paolo Tiramani.

The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements using a fair value method which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments including stock options. The fair value method requires the Company to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted that are then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur in the year-of forfeiture and share-based compensation expense adjusted accordingly. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, require the input of highly subjective assumptions, and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant-date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected dividend yield, expected volatility, and the expected life of the award.

 

The Company the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

                                                                                                                     As of           

                                                                                                               December 31, 2023     

Expected life (years) (1)                                                                                                      5-6.5 

Risk-free interest rate (2)                                                                                                2.00-3.50%

Expected volatility (3)                                                                                                         41.6%

Annual dividend yield (4)                                                                                                          0%

Weighted average fair value of options granted                                                             $              0.65-$0.80 

 

 (1) In accordance with SAB Topic 14, the expected life of employee stock options was estimated using the “simplified method,” as the

      Company has no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and employment duration

      for its stock option grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of

      each grant. The Company believes the use of the simplified method is appropriate due to the employee stock options qualifying as

      “plain-vanilla” options under the criteria established by SAB Topic

      14.

 

 (2) The risk-free rate was based on the United States bond yield rate at the time of grant of the award, whose term is consistent

      with expected life of the stock

      options.

 

 (3) Based on historical experience over a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options.

 

 (4) Expected annual rate of dividends is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay

      any cash dividends in the foreseeable

      future.

 

Share-based compensation expense is not adjusted for estimated forfeitures, but instead adjusted upon an actual forfeiture of a stock option. Amounts recorded for forfeited or expired unexercised options are accounted for in the year of forfeiture.

 

Restricted Stock Units (“RSU”s):

 

As part of the 2021 Stock Option Plan, the Company issued RSUs to certain employees of the Company. RSUs represent a right to receive a single common share that is both nontransferable and forfeitable until certain conditions are satisfied. RSU awards generally vest over a 3-year service period and stock-based compensation is recognized over the service period.

 

There were no RSU awards during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

                                                                   17

The expected life of awards that vest immediately use the contractual maturity since they are vested when issued. For stock price volatility, the Company uses public company compatibles as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the option at the grant-date.

 

The Company recognizes stock option forfeitures as they occur as there is insufficient historical data to accurately determine future forfeiture rates.

 

Future stock-based compensation expense related to these options and RSUs as of March 31, 2024, to be recognized is approximately $25.6 million, which is expected to be expensed over the remaining vesting period of 2.1 years. The amount of future stock-based compensation expense could be affected by any future option and RSU grants or by any forfeitures.

 

                                                                   18



 

 

NOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual agreements with third parties that include non-cancelable payment obligations, for which it is liable in future periods. These arrangements can include terms binding the Company to minimum payments and/or penalties if it terminates the agreement for any reason other than an event of default as described in the agreement.

 

In the course of business, the Company is party to various legal proceedings and claims from time to time. A liability will be accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the probability of a material loss is remote. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of these proceedings. There are no legal proceedings, which the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

 

Litigation

 

The Company entered a settlement with the state of Arizona related to the delivery of Casita units prior to receiving certification from the state. The Company paid $48K during 2023 and agreed to reconstruct the units already delivered, and make sure any subsequent delivered units adhere to the regulations.

 

In connection with the Casitas delivered in Arizona, the Company entered a settlement with a customer related to the costs of reconstruction of the Casita units. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the customer has agreed to pay the first $1,000K in costs, and 90% of any costs more than the $1,000K. The Company will only incur 50% of shipping costs should the contract be cancelled, and the units returned. The Company accrued a $570K warranty for such costs and any costs related to the 10-year limited warranty offered to the customer.

 

In December 2023, the Company received certification from ICC Evaluation Service related to the structural panels of the Casitas, which assist with procuring “plan approval” from various state regulatory agencies.

 

Claims filed by the Company on its former employees

 

     (i)  The Company is addressing a situation where a former employee violated their confidentiality agreement post-termination.

           Quantifying the resulting harm is complex and ongoing. Legal action has been initiated in Nevada State Court against the

           former employee, with efforts underway to fulfill court requirements for service. The Company’s claim is straightforward,

           and it anticipates a judgment in its favor, likely resulting in compensation below

           $250,000.

 

     (ii) The Company is addressing a situation involving a former employee who breached agreements. Assessing the exact impact of this

           breach is ongoing. Legal proceedings have been initiated in Nevada, then moved to federal court. The former employee,

           represented by counsel, filed motions. Discovery is currently paused. The Company’s claim is straightforward, with no

           counterclaims. It anticipates a favorable judgment, likely resulting in compensation below a certain

           threshold.

 

     (iii)The Company uncovered potential misconduct by a former employee related to a stock scheme, the impact of which is challenging

           to measure. Promptly upon discovery, the Company engaged external legal and consulting resources for an internal

           investigation and reported the matter to the FBI. Legal action was initiated in New York and later transferred to Nevada,

           but serving the former employee has proven difficult. Alternate service methods are being pursued. The Company’s claim is

           one-sided, without counterclaims. It expects a favorable judgment, likely resulting in compensation below a certain

           threshold, though investigations into damages

           continue.

 

Claims filed by a former employee against the Company

 

     (i)  The Company received notifications of employment-related charges filed by a former employee with the EEOC and the NLRB. The

           allegations involve various issues such as discrimination and interference with employee rights. The Company provided

           responses to both agencies and is awaiting further developments. Due to limited information on the former employee’s

           arguments, the Company’s assessment of liability potential remains inconclusive, but it does not expect a significant impact

           on its financial

           position.

 

                                                                   19



 

 

Claim filed by the Company based on Business Disparagement and Defamation

 

An internet blogger who posted defamatory information regarding the Company. The harm suffered as a result of this Internet Blogger’s actions is difficult to quantify, and has not yet been fully quantified. The company filed a legal action against the Internet Blogger in Nevada State Court. The Internet Blogger has not appeared and we recently filed a motion for default judgment against him seeking $50K in damages. This is an affirmative claim and there are no counter or other claims being asserted against the Company. The Company anticipates an immaterial judgment in its favor.

 

Claim filed against the Company by former COO

 

The Company’s former Chief Operating Officer, terminated for cause after seven months of employment, filed a civil complaint in Nevada alleging various claims against the Company and its directors. The amount sought by the former employee is unspecified. The defendants (Company’s Directors at the time) filed motions to dismiss certain claims, which were partially granted. The Company denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim alleging fraud and breach of contract. Damages are still being investigated. The case is in the discovery phase, and the former employee’s deposition revealed potential evidence tampering, prompting the Company to prepare a motion. No trial date is set, and the Company anticipates a favorable outcome.

 

Claim filed by Leader Capital High Quality Income Fund against the Company

 

Leader Capital is a shareholder of Company and has filed suit against Company and its transfer agent, Transfer Online, Inc. claiming Breach of Duty to Register a Transfer of a Security, Conversion, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. Plaintiff in said action seeks relief and monetary damages including compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs. The Company has agreed to provide a defense to Transfer Online and we have been engaged in defending the lawsuit. The discovery phase has not yet commenced, and it is difficult to quantify the potential for liability at this early stage of the litigation. The Company doesn’t believe this will have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 

 

In addition to our consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See above Forward-Looking Statements. 

 

Overview

 

The Company is a manufacturer of building systems and is in the process of scaling our production of “Casitas” to meet the demand for our products. In addition to our first Nevada manufacturing facility (“Factory 1”), which we took possession of in May 2021, we expanded our production capacity by signing a lease for additional Nevada facilities (“Factory 2”) in June 2022 and (“Factory 3”) in May 2023. While our growth has mainly been funded by our capital raising activities as described below in “Liquidity,” we anticipate our increased manufacturing capacity will allow us to build Boxes more efficiently, and, in doing so generate additional revenue in the future. To emphasize the sales impact, we have expanded our sales and business development team, hiring three additional sales resources.

 

In 2023, we manufactured 260 Casitas primarily planned to fulfill an order with one of our customers in Arizona but have not made any deliveries. Various permits from state and local governments are required in order to sell and install the Casitas as modular houses. The permitting process has caused delays in the delivery of the product and has affected the timing and amount of the Company’s revenues. Currently, the Company is in the process of obtaining various permits related to the Casitas.

 

In December 2023, BOXABL completed the requested third-party inspection for the State of Arizona and received a report recommending Factory and Casita certification which was approved by the State. Accordingly, we are resuming sales to customers in Arizona, and in states where there is no state modular program, and for projects that are under a different classification such as park model RVs or government projects. Nevertheless, these new sales may face delays due to the time needed to prepare the site for installation, arrange capital for payment of amounts due to the Company by the purchaser, and other preparatory steps that need to be taken in order to arrange delivery and installation of the units.

 

On May 2, 2024, BOXABL received approval to sell units in California under the residential building code.

 

BOXABL has approved plans in several jurisdictions that do not have modular housing legislation (Oklahoma, Utah, Tribal Lands, etc.). The Company is also approved to sell Casitas as a Park Model RV configuration. We believe the Company can sell Park Model RVs in forty-five states without additional qualifications.

 

The Company anticipates that the incoming demand from the aforementioned jurisdictions, other jurisdictions currently in the process to be approved as for example Texas, plus customers under Park Model RV categories will support the Company’s operations.

 

The Company retained multiple third-party inspection agencies to assist in achieving certification in multiples states with modular housing legislation simultaneously. The Company does not expect that this regulatory process will cause further delays in our ability to generate revenue with respect to our current or future production.

 

As of May 13, 2024, the Company sold six units in 2024 to states that do not have modular housing legislation or under Park Model RV.

 

                                                                   21



 

 

The Company maintains short-term liquidity of $35,312K and $46,259K as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Notes. In addition, the Company’s inventory balance as of March 31, 2024 was $19,158K on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to sell these finished goods during 2024. Currently the Company’s average negative operating cashflow needed to maintain operations beyond the short-term is approximately $3.7 million per month. Accordingly, the Company’s liquidity including current assets is sufficient to fund approximately 14 months of operations.

 

The Company does not have financial debt and has recorded $9,007K and $9,822K in deposits in advance as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to automation equipment to secure our operational ramp-up in production. The Company maintains a commitment to pay an additional $2,341K for this equipment upon delivery.

 

The Company expects to generate funds from the sale of its current inventory in 2024, sale of future inventory resulting from manufacturing, sales of equity securities pursuant to an offering under Regulation A, and Regulation D in which a preliminary offering statement has been filed, and, if needed, could also look for financing opportunities related to our equipment.

 

During 2024, the Company restructured the sales and marketing team, to better focus on the demand from its sales channels. Skilled sales resources have been added and allocated to support the B2B and B2C channels respectively.

 

Trend Information

 

In total, we have received interest from more than 175,000 potential customers wishing to reserve their place in line for a Casita Box. Each of these potential customers has agreed to our Room Module Order Agreement. Of that number, we currently have deposits from over 8,500 potential customers ranging from $100, $200, $1,200 or $5,000 for over 15,000 Casitas. We are currently only accepting deposits of $200. While there is no assurance that any of these reservations will result in binding orders or revenue, we believe that the volume of reservations demonstrates significant interest in our product, which necessitates our efforts to focus on scaling up production capacity.

 

We also recently announced a new prototype, frequently referenced as the “GOLDIBOX” with three-bedrooms, two-and-a-half bathrooms and an outdoor deck, which is expanding public understanding of BOXABL beyond tiny houses and is already getting a lot of attention from Developers. We are now able to produce multi-bedroom units with our 19x19 ft. Boxes.

 

The Company is currently engaging in the developmental phase of an expanded product line, which includes a variety of sizes and configurations that extend beyond our existing Casita model. The growing interest expressed by various external stakeholders including developers has prompted us to explore additional sales channels. We anticipate the delivery of the initial prototypes in 2024.

 

Inflation

 

We have not yet been materially impacted by inflationary pressures because of the key differentiators in our building components compared to traditional, stick-built homes, as well as our manufacturing process in the factory setting compared to construction in the field. If the Company encounters significant increases in the cost of manufacture due to inflation, we believe we would be able to pass on those costs to end consumers as they would likely encounter greater inflationary impacts in traditionally built homes. Recent inflationary pressures have not materially impacted the Company’s operations.

 

                                                                   22



 

 

Results of Operations

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023

 

Revenues

 

Gross Revenues were $625K and $28K for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue in 2024 was generated by sales of our Casitas, supporting labor and materials, including the sale of six Casitas to four customers. We are continuing to work to execute on the new sales strategy, which includes closing deals from our waitlist.

 

Cost of Goods Sold

 

Cost of Goods Sold were $4,245K and $1,673K for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of products used in the production of the Company’s finished products, shipping, the related labor, stock compensation expense and overhead charges associated with that production. The Manufacturing Overhead represents the wages of salaried personnel directly involved in the manufacturing and production process, increasing year over year aligned with our strategy to increase production.

 

The cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, consist of the following:

 

                                                                      March 31,              

(In Thousands)                                                 2024              2023       

Direct Material/Shipping                                 $            223  $             10 

Direct labor                                                           67                 - 

Manufacturing Overhead                                              4,120             1,602 

Cost of Goods Sold                                       $          4,410  $          1,612 

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company continued developing and implementing strategic cost-saving initiatives to reduce the cost of goods sold. In particular, standardizing terms and conditions with suppliers, improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing quality issues, and implementing risk management procedures and maintaining employee engagement. In addition, the Company continued upgrading the manufacturing concept and installing more automated equipment to scale production. We expect this will allow the Company to ramp up production and reduce the cost per unit further.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, manufacturing overhead was $4,120K and $1,603K, respectively. This consisted primarily of the allocation of indirect labor, rent and lease expense, and depreciation expense. Other allocations to manufacturing overhead included indirect supplies, scrapped material, and maintenance costs. These overhead costs are relatively fixed and will not increase proportionally with the increase in production or sales.

 

Operating Expenses

 

During the three-month period ending March 31, 2024 and 2023, operating expenses were as follows:

 

                                                                      March 31,               

(In Thousands)                                                 2024              2023       

General and Administrative                               $          3,729  $          3,010 

Sales and Marketing                                                 2,859             1,369 

Research and Development                                            2,247             1,188 

Total Operating Expense                                  $          8,835  $          5,567 

 

General and administrative expenses consists of compensation and benefits for positions on the factory floor and company administration, rents, shop supplies, and utilities. As we expand production capacity and ramp up operations, we expect these expenses to continue to grow. Advertising and marketing expenses generally consist of advertising and promotions. We have undertaken advertising campaigns specific to the product, as well as advertising directly to investors. Research and development is essential to test and develop the BOXABL product further and reflects a push to increase capacity, sales, and further test raw material used in production and researching industry standards and regulations.

 

Compensation Expense

 

The Company’s Equity Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) among other types of equity incentives, including ISOs and NQSOs. The RSUs granted by the Board vest depending upon future events and are expensed periodically, over the vesting term. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 56,071K and 60,500K RSUs outstanding. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 286K and 286K RSU shares, respectively, were fully vested. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 52,713K and 55,236K ISO/NQSO shares, respectively, outstanding.

 

                                                                   23



 

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Sources of Liquidity

 

To date, our operations have been primarily financed by our exempt offerings of securities made in reliance on Regulation A, Regulation CF and both Rule 506(c) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D. For details regarding our securities offerings, see below “Sales of Securities.”

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company held $6,718 in cash and cash equivalents and $28,594 in investments in short-term treasury notes, compared to $18,574K in cash and cash equivalents and $27,685K in investments in short-term treasury notes as of December 31, 2023.

 

Historical Cash Flows

 

At March 31, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, which we achieved through our offerings of securities as discussed above. Based on the Company’s current burn rate, we anticipate that the current short-term liquidity including on-hand inventory and accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet our immediate cash needs for approximately 14 months.

 

                                                                       Three Months Ended March 31,        

(In Thousands)                                                           2024                 2023

As we continue producing Casita Boxes, the amount of inventory consisting of finished goods has increased compared to the amount of raw materials as inventory.

 

Property, Plant and Equipment

 

Property, Plant and Equipment increased to $12,485K as of March 31, 2024, from $10,766K at December 31, 2023 resulting from additional capital improvements to our manufacturing facility.

The Company notes that while the agreement was never executed, the parties have been acting under the terms of the agreement, with the Company receiving the full payment of the purchase orders ahead of shipping units). Pursuant to our method for recognizing revenue, deferred revenue reflects the amount that had not yet been delivered as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

Inventory

 

Inventory consists of raw materials, in-bound freight and duties, work in progress, and finished goods. Inventories available for sale are valued at the lower of cost or net realized value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, bulk sales, and the expected recoverable values for each disposition category. On a periodic basis, the Company performs a physical count of its inventory and records an Inventory Valuation Allowance for inventory that has become obsolete or inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value. Damaged and obsolete inventory are valued based on management’s best estimate and any difference charged to expense

 

Intangible Assets

 

The Company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company utilizes a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value, and if so, the Company will perform a quantitative test. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company applies ASC 718 for its Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation for all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the associated vesting periods. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated on the date of the grant based on the fair value of the Company’s underlying common stock. For stock options and restricted stock awards subject to a three-year vesting period, the Company recognizes compensation expense over the associated service periods.

 

Determining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and, if different assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from the amounts recorded.

Planned Timeline

 

With the success of our initial fundraising through our offerings under Regulation A, Regulation D, and Regulation CF, we have continued to advance our planned timeline beyond initial testing of Casitas, delivery of orders, and developing Factory 2 and 3. As of May 15, 2024, we see our next 12-month timeline as follows:

 

Month 1-3            ●    Continue delivery of orders to states do not have modular housing legislation, Park Model RV configuration,

                           to California and to Arizona. Costs are estimated to be $3 million.

                           

                     ●    Ramp-up production. Costs are estimated to be $40.2 million.

                     ●    Obtain plant and Casita certification in Florida, New Mexico, and Texas. Costs are estimated to be $100K per

                           state.

                           

Month 4-6            ●    Complete the design and prototyping of our next Generation of Boxes (new sizes), and begin production of

                           these generations. Costs are estimated to be $9.3

                           million.

                           

Month 7+             ●    Begin and complete ramp up of production to achieve our desired production at scale for our facilities.

                     ●    Upgrade manufacturing equipment including: CNC equipment, Lamination Line, Paint Line, and Casita Assembly

                           Conveyor System. Costs to complete these orders are $2.4

                           million.

                     ●    Obtain next generation Casita certification in several states including Arizona, California, Texas and

                           Nevada. Costs are estimated to be $100K per

                           state.

 

The Company believes the above referenced activities are achievable with its current cash and cash equivalents as referenced in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview.

 

On the regulatory side of our business, we have received Generation 1.0 state modular approvals required for our Casitas in Arizona, which was finalized in December 2023. On May 2, 2024, we received approval to sell units in California under the residential building code. We still anticipate achieving state modular approvals for our current generation Casitas in California, Nevada, Texas, New Mexico and Florida followed by Generation 2.0 state modular approvals for our Casitas and our multifamily set-ups in California, Arizona, and Nevada later in 2024.

 

There is no assurance that we will be able to meet this timeline. It is provided to identify our intentions for moving forward during the next 12 months of operations.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by §229.10(f)(1), BOXABL is not required to provide the information under this Item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

 

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management are required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, as of March 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   26



 

 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

Arizona Department of Housing Settlement

 

On January 23, 2023, the Office of Administration of the Arizona Dept. of Housing brought an administrative complaint against BOXABL, alleging that BOXABL did not comply with certain requirements prior to shipping housing units into Arizona, and seeking penalties up to suspension or revocation of its license, an administrative penalty, or probation.

 

On February 9, 2023, BOXABL filed its verified Answer, explaining inter alia that BOXABL had acted in good faith and in accordance with its reasonable interpretation of the Department’s instructions regarding the shipments into Arizona, and that shipments were only made after requesting and obtaining the Department’s written consent and authorization in November 2022. This administrative complaint was resolved by settlement agreement on April 21, 2023. BOXABL paid an administrative penalty to Arizona Dept. of Housing in the amount of $48 thousand on April 26, 2023, and has satisfied all of its obligations to the Arizona Department of Housing under the settlement agreement.

 

In a separate settlement between the Parties, dated May 30, 2023, regarding the costs of the reconstruction of the Casitas, Freeport has assumed responsibility to pay reconstruction costs, but the Company will be responsible for 10% of any costs in excess of $1 million. The Company will also incur 50% of shipping costs in the event the contract is canceled and the Casitas removed. The Company accrued a $570 thousand warranty for such costs and any costs related to the 10-year limited warranty offering to Pronghorn.

 

Litigation Against Former Employees

 

On or about June 13, 2023, the Company filed two lawsuits against former employees alleging claims including breach of contract, violations of the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act, violations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and demand for temporary and permanent injunctive relief. These litigation matters remain pending. Management does not anticipate these matters will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

On or about March 2023, the Company discovered through one of its compliance programs that a former employee had issued fraudulent securities. An internal investigation was commenced and the matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Shortly thereafter, the Company filed a lawsuit against this former employee for breach of contract, violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, violations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, Conversion, Unjust Enrichment, Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and for a temporary and permanent injunction. The matter remains pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. Management does not anticipate this matter will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

On September 2, 2022, BOXABL received notice of a charge of employment discrimination had been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) against BOXABL under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The circumstances of the alleged discrimination are alleged to have occurred on or about May 1, 2022. On October 3, 2022, BOXABL (through counsel) filed a position statement refuting the allegations and providing supporting documentation of BOXABL’s position. The matter is pending before the EEOC. Management does not anticipate this matter will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

On or about September 25, 2023, BOXABL received notice of a charge of unfair labor practices had been filed with the National Labor Relations Board against BOXABL under Section 7 of the NLRA. The circumstances of the alleged charge are alleged to have occurred between March 2023 and September 2023. On or about October 12, 2023, BOXABL (through counsel) filed a position statement refuting the allegations and providing supporting documentation of BOXABL’s position. The matter is pending before the NLRB. Management does not anticipate this matter will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

                                                                   27



 

 

Other Litigation

 

On April 30, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against Brave Control Solutions, Inc. (“Brave”), and its CEO, Brent McPhail. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuit related to the Company’s claim of breach of contract by Brave related to the design, manufacture, and programing of specialized equipment to be used by the Company. Management does not believe this litigation will have a material affect on the Company’s operations, but intends to seek full redress available to it.

 

On June 13, 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit against a person, not affiliated with the Company, alleging claims based on business disparagement and defamation of the Company. Management does not anticipate the matter will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

On November 19, 2021, a former employee, who served as Chief Operating Officer during the seven-month period from March 2021 until September 27, 2021, at which time he was terminated, filed a complaint against the Company and its directors in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, claiming breach of contract and wrongful termination. While the legal action has proceeded to discovery, the Company denies the merit of the allegations and will continue to defend against them. Management does not anticipate these matters will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

On or about October 5, 2023, Leader Capital High Quality Income Fund, a series of Leader Funds Trust, a Delaware statutory trust, commenced an action against BOXABL and other defendants in the District Court for Nevada asserting claims for breach of duty to register a transfer of a security (NRS 104.8401), Conversion, Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. Plaintiff claims that it requested the removal of a restrictive legend to shares held by Plaintiff and that BOXABL refused and/or delayed approval of the removal and caused Plaintiff to suffer damages. BOXABL denies the merit of the allegations and damages sought and will continue to defend against them. Management does not anticipate these matters will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

 

We know of no other existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

 

The Company is party to various legal proceedings and claims from time to time. A liability will be accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the probability of a material loss is remote. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of these proceedings.
