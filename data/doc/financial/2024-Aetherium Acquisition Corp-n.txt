PART I

 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 

Introduction

 

We are a blank check company incorporated in April 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities related to our initial public offering and search for an initial business combination target. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular business, industry or sector or geographical region, although we intend to focus on businesses in the education, training and education technology (“EdTech”) industries, specifically in Asia (excluding China). Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).

 

Initial Public Offering

 

The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on December 29, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On January 3, 2022, we consummated the IPO of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock (the “Public Shares”), and one redeemable warrant, with respect to shares of Class A common stock included in the Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000, and incurring offering costs of $6,755,007, of which $4,025,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On January 3, 2022, the over-allotment option was also exercised in full.

 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 528,500 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,285,000 (the “Private Placement”). The Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO.

 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 3, 2022, an amount of $116,725,000 ($10.15 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the liquidation of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders.

 

Our management team is led by Jonathan Chan, our Chief Executive Officer, and Alex Lee, our Chief Financial Officer, both of whom permanently reside in, and are citizens of, the United States. Mr. Chan brings nearly 30 years of leadership experience across numerous engagements in the fields of banking and corporate finance covering the technology, media and telecom sectors.

Our Company

 

We are a blank check company incorporated in April 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular business, industry or sector or geographical region, although we intend to focus on businesses in the education, training and education technology (“EdTech”) industries, specifically in Asia (excluding China). Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).

 

While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on businesses in the education, training and EdTech industries, specifically in Asia (excluding China). Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We believe that combining our company with a leading high-growth education, training and EdTech company will fuel organic growth and provide a platform for future acquisitions. We will be focusing our search on companies built on disruptive technologies and business platforms. We believe this is the key to gain competitive advantages. With the application of additional capital through our company, we believe we will be able to fast track technological advancement, employ cutting edge design, and improve processes.

 

                                                                   10

 

 

Acquisition Criteria

 

Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

 

          ●         Target Size. Consistent with our investment thesis as described above, we plan to target businesses with total

                     enterprise values ranging from $200 million to $1 billion in the education, training and EdTech

                     sectors.

                     

          ●         Businesses with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have

                     the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product

                     development, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating

                     leverage.

                     

          ●         Businesses with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses

                     that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or

                     more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure

                     requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder

                     value.

                     

          ●         Strong Management. We will seek companies with strong management teams already in place. We will spend significant

                     time assessing a company’s leadership and human fabric, and maximizing its efficiency over

                     time.

                     

          ●         Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being

                     publicly-traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are

                     associated with being a publicly traded

                     company.

                     

          ●         Appropriate Valuations and Upside Potential. We intend to apply rigorous, criteria-based, disciplined, and

                     valuation-centric metrics. We intend to acquire a target on terms that we believe provide significant upside

                     potential while seeking to limit risk to our

                     investors.

 

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant.

 

Initial Business Combination

 

Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

 

                                                                   11

 

 

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

 

To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

 

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

 

Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets

 

Certain members of our management team have spent significant portions of their careers working with businesses in the education, training and EdTech industries and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry. The members of our board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with technology related companies and bring additional relationships that further broaden our industry network.

 

This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous past transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms, law firms and large business enterprises.

 

Members of our management team and our independent directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or placement units following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.

 

                                                                   12

 

 

In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our officers and directors will agree to offer all suitable business combination opportunities to us before any other person or company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering, subject to any pre-existing contractual or fiduciary obligations they may have (which pre-existing fiduciary duties and any potential conflicts of interest arising therefrom will have been disclosed to the underwriters prior to the initial filing of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part), on customary terms reasonably acceptable to the underwriters.

 

In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Similarly, our financial advisor may work with other special purpose acquisition companies. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team

 

Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the Brand AA Sdn Bhd management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Brand AA Sdn Bhd Merger is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, including the Brand AA Sdn Bhd Merger, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs after our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.

 

Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

 

Lack of Business Diversification

 

For an indefinite period after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

 

     ●    subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse

           impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination;

           and

     ●    cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.

 

                                                                   13

Mr. Lee graduated with a B.A. degree in Cultural Anthropology from Northeastern University and holds FINRA Series 63 and SIE qualifications.

 

We believe our management team is well positioned to take advantage of the growing set of acquisition opportunities focused on the education, training and EdTech industries and that our contacts and relationships, ranging from owners and management teams of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, to accountants and business brokers will allow us to generate an attractive transaction for our stockholders.

 

Competition

 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

 

                                                                   14

 

 

Employees

 

We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.

 

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination

 

We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.

 

Type of Transaction                                                                                             Whether Stockholder

                                                                                                                    Approval is

                                                                                                                      Required

Purchase of assets                                                                                                      No

Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company                                                     No

Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company                                                                       No

Merger of the company with a target                                                                                     Yes

 

Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

 

     ●    we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our shares of common stock then

           outstanding (other than in a public

           offering);

           

     ●    any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or

           such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be

           acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding

           common stock or voting power of 5% or more;

           or

           

     ●    the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.

 

The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

 

     ●    the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and

           there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the

           transaction or result in other additional burdens on the

           Company;

           

     ●    the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;

           

     ●    the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;

           

     ●    other time and budget constraints of the Company; and

           

     ●    additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to

           stockholders.

 

                                                                   15

Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination

 

At the time of the IPO, our Amended and Restated Certificate provided that if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within fifteen (15) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account, and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

 

On March 23, 2023, we held a Special Meeting of our stockholders seeking approval to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times (the “Charter Amendment”), each such extension for an additional one (1) month period from April 3, 2023 to April 3, 2024. We also sought approval to amend the investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 29, 2021, by and between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, allowing us to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period, until April 3, 2024, by depositing into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders the lesser of (A) $0.055 per non-redeeming publicly held share of common stock and (B) $150,000 (the “Extension Payment”) for each one-month extension. Both proposals were approved.

 

On March 5, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of an annual meeting (the “Extension Meeting”) to:

 

          1)   amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Charter Amendment Proposal”) to

                extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination to thirty-six (36) months from

                the effectiveness date of the Company’s Form S-1 by the SEC, which was December 29, 2021, by depositing into the Trust

                Account (defined below) $0.033 per non-redeeming Public

                Share;

                

          2)   amend Aetherium’s Charter to amend certain provisions which restrict the Class B common stock, par value $0.0001, of

                the Company (the “Class B common stock” or the “Founder Shares”) from converting to Class A common stock before the

                consummation of an initial business combination (the “Conversion Amendment

                Proposal”);

                

          3)   amend to eliminate from the Charter the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares to the extent that

                such redemption would result in the Company having net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule

                3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (or any successor rule)) of less

                than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation”) in order to allow the Company to redeem Public Shares irrespective of

                whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment” and, such

                proposal, the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”);

                and

                

          4)   amend the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 29, 2021, as subsequently amended (the

                “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), to

                allow the Company to extend the Extended Termination Date to thirty-six (36) months from the effectiveness date of the

                Company’s Form S-1 by the SEC, which was December 29, 2021, until December 29, 2024, which proposal also included an

                amendment to authorize the withdrawal of interest from the trust account to pay any excise tax incurred arising under

                the United States Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, effective for stock repurchases taking place after December 31,

                2022, which includes shareholders redemptions (the “Trust Amendments

                Proposal”).

 

                                                                   16

 

 

The proposal to adjourn the Extension Meeting to a later date redemptions (the “Adjournment Proposal”) was also presented because there were insufficient votes to approve the Company’s Trust each of the foregoing proposals. As previously reported, the Company filed a first amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 23, 2024 to amend the Extension Payment amount per share for each public share of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding and to clarify that if the Charter Amendments Proposal (Proposal 1) and Trust Amendment Proposal (Proposal 4) are approved, the Company will only withdraw from the trust account twenty-six (26%) of its excise taxes to reflect the remaining percentage of public shares outstanding.

 

As previously reported, the Company filed a second amendment (“Amendment No. 2”) to the Definitive Proxy Statement on March 19, 2024 to remove the language in the Trust Amendment Proposal (Proposal 4) that sought approval to allow the Company to withdraw from the trust account any funds whatsoever to pay its excise taxes. As revised, the Trust Amendment Proposal (Proposal 4) no longer sought approval to pay the Company’s excise tax. To allow time for additional votes on the Trust Amendment Proposal, the Company postponed the adjournment of the Meeting to March 28, 2024.

 

On March 28, 2024, there were 3,519,503 shares of Class A common stock and 2,875,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the record date for the Extension Meeting, February 9, 2024. At the Extension Meeting, there were 2,678,089 shares of Common Stock present in person or by proxy, representing approximately 87.34% of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the record date, which constituted a quorum. Each of the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Conversion Amendment Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, and the Trust Amendments Proposal were approved at the Extension Meeting on March 28, 2024, afforded the Company until December 29, 2024 to complete its business combination.

 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information

 

We have registered our common stock and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

 

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time frame.

 

We are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

 

We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.

 

                                                                   17

 

 

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

 

We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 13, 2027, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.

 

Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

 

Nasdaq Continued Listing Compliance

 

On May 6, 2023, Aetherium Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) received written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Company was not in compliance with the continued listing requirement to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) of $50,000,000, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company received 180 calendar days, until November 6, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum MVLS of the Company’s common stock was required to meet or exceed $50,000,000 for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day compliance period.

 

                                                                   18

 

 

Additionally, on May 23, 2023 and August 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that it did not comply with Listing Rule 5250(c), due to its failure to timely file its Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The Company filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023 on December 20, 2023 and on November 27, 2023, the Staff provided written notice to the Company does not comply with Listing Rule 5250(c) because it did not file its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023. In addition, Staff has determined that the Company does not comply with the minimum 400 total holders as required by Listing Rule 5450(a)(2).

 

On December 4, 2023, the Company appealed the delist determination to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), and requested that the stay of delisting, which otherwise would expire on December 19, 2023, pursuant to Rule 5815(a)(l)(B), be extended until the Panel issued a final decision on the matter. The Company provided a submission in which it requested a stay of delisting pending the hearing, informed of the reasons for the late filings, and its plan to regain compliance.

 

On February 8, 2024, the Staff advised the Company that it has regained compliance with the filing requirement in Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). The Company prepared and presented to the Panel, in advance of the Panel Hearing that occurred on February 27, 2024, its plan of compliance with regards to the remaining deficiencies.

 

On March 13, 2024, the Panel issued a decision that grants the Company’s request to continue its listing on Nasdaq based on the information presented. The Hearing Panel has determined to grant the Company’s request for an exception until May 28, 2024, subject to the condition that on or before March 31, 2024, the Company will file the Form F-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the shares resulting from the Business Combination. The Panel cited to the Company’s proactive correction of the reporting delinquency and engagement of new securities counsel and new accounting firm, that reflects Company’s commitment to ensuring its periodic filings are timely going forward. Panel also noted that as of the date of their decision, the Company has filed a report Form 8-K reflecting completion of a definitive agreement to enter into the Business Combination on February 28, 2024.

 

On April 1, 2024, the Panel granted an extension to the exception granted on March 13, 2024 (the “Decision”) to the Company provided that (i) on or before May 20, 2024, the Company will file the Form F-4 to register the shares resulting from the Business Combination; and (ii) on or before May 28, 2024, the Company will demonstrate compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

 

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights

 

Public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the initial business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

 

                                                                   19

 

 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the Company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the Company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved.

 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.

 

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until December 29, 2024 (or as extended as provided in our registration statement). Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination.

 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination

 

Our Charter Amendment following the March 28, 2024 Stockholders Meeting provides that we will have up to until December 29, 2024 through one-month Extensions to provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional $0.033 per share for each month, or as extended by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If we are unable to complete our business combination by December 29, 2024 (or as otherwise extended), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

 

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by December 29, 2024 (or as otherwise extended by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation). Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the placement units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of its intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor is not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. The public stockholders will not be able to vote on or redeem their public shares in connection with any such extensions.

 

                                                                   20

 

 

Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination including with respect to any shares obtained through the placement units. However, if our sponsor, directors or members of our management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination.

 

Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.

 

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from up to $100,000 of funds from the interest on the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.

 

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering the sale of the placement rights, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.

 

                                                                   21

 

 

The underwriters will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.10 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

 

In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.10 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our sponsor asserts that they are unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.10 per unit.

 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

 

In the event that we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder. If we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder.

 

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

 

                                                                   22

 

 

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed, dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

 

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

 

If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per unit to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some, or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

 

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our common stock, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination.

 

                                                                   23

 

 

Public stockholders who redeem their common stock in connection with a stockholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, with respect to such shares of our common stock so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations:

 

          ●    we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination

          ●    our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an

                established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced

                management

                

          ●    there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase

                the costs associated with completing our initial business

                combination;

                

          ●    changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive

                for us to negotiate and complete an initial business

          ●    we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to

                us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial

                business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing

                transaction;

                

          ●    our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account

                only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential

                conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including,

                for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business

                combination;

                

          ●    since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not

                completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), and because

                our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders

                would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a

                particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business

                combination;

 

                                                                   25

 

 

          ●    changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with

                any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our

                initial business combination, and results of

                operations;

                

          ●    Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange prior to an initial business combination, which could

                limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject it to additional trading

                restrictions;

                

          ●    the SEC has recently issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we,

                a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may

                increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the

                circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such

                proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we

                might otherwise

                choose;

                

          ●    the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially

                higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is

                substantially less than $10.00 per

                share;

                

          ●    if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to

                institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such

                circumstances, unless we can modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may

                abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the

                Company;

                

          ●    we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed

                transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain

                U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United

                States;

                

          ●    recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us

                to consummate an initial business

                combination;

                

          ●    military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which

                could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business

                combination;

                

          ●    we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 related

                to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written

                policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. If we are unable to develop

                and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report

                our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and

                adversely affect our business and operating

                results;

                

          ●    there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern” if we do not complete our initial

                business combination by December 29, 2024;

                and

                

          ●    resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect

                subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial

                business combination within the required period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per

                share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our rights will

                expire

                worthless.

Use of Proceeds

 

On January 3, 2022, we completed our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, including the issuance of 1,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s full exercise of its over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.

 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we completed a Private Placement of an aggregate of 528,500 Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,285,000. The Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. The holders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Placement Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances) until 30 days after completion of our initial business combination. The holders were also granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Placement Units. The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transaction did not involve a public offering.

 

A total of $116,725,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was deposited in the Trust Account, over which Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company is trustee, which was established for the benefit of our public stockholders. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, and up to $100,000 of interest that may be used for our dissolution expenses, the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Placement Units will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activities, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

 

Our Charter Amendment following the March 28, 2024 Stockholders Meeting provides that we will have up to until December 29, 2024 through one-month Extensions to provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional $0.033 per share for each month, or as extended by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K including, without limitation, statements under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Form 10-K, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or the Company’s management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company’s management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.

 

                                                                   28

 

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

 

Overview

 

We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 15, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

 

All activity through December 31, 2023 relates to our formation, IPO, and search for a prospective initial business combination target.

 

We are incurring significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans with Brand AA Sdn Bhd. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.

 

Results of Operations

 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from April 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net income of $726,042, which consisted of investment income earned on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $2,752,079 offset by formation and operational costs of $895,403, franchise tax of $200,050 and provision for income tax of $930,584.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

On January 3, 2022, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000 (the “Initial Public Offering”), and incurring offering costs of $6,755,007, of which $4,025,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On January 3, 2022, the over-allotment option was exercised in full.

 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 528,500 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,285,000 (the “Private Placement”). A total of $116,725,000 of the net proceeds from the Offering and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. The proceeds held in the trust account were invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. A total of $1,451,900 was deposited into the operating account of the Company.

 

                                                                   29

 

 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account, if any, to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. Other than as described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. As December 31, 2023, the Company has borrowed $537,431 under such loans.

 

Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.

 

As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at December 31, 2023, the Company had $4 of cash in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $4,491,448. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful.

 

Going Concern Consideration

 

The Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the IPO, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The balance sheet does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.

 

Related Party Transactions

 

The Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $122,352 of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the IPO. The note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or the date on which the Company determines not to proceed with the Initial Public Offering. Following the IPO of the Company on January 3, 2022, a total of $122,352 under the promissory note was repaid on January 6, 2022.

 

                                                                   30

 

 

On May 11, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. In June 2021, the Sponsor transferred 20,000 shares each to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and David Kopp, 15,000 shares to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and 10,000 shares to each of the Company’s independent director nominees. In July 2021, the Sponsor also transferred 431,250 shares to ARC Group Limited. In November 2021, ARC Group Limited transferred 140,400 shares to Max Mark Capital Limited, 140,400 shares to Jonathan Chan, and 10,000 shares to Mei Eng Goy. ARC Group Limited purchased its net 140,450 shares in consideration of services provided by such party as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Initial Public Offering. Each of the transfers above were completed at the same per share purchase price as the Sponsor paid for the founder shares, or $0.009. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of this offering (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. As of December 31, 2023, the Sponsor owned 2,358,750 shares of Class B common stock. As the underwriters’ over-allotment option has been exercised in full, none of the Sponsor shares were forfeited.

 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As December 31, 2023, the Company has borrowed $522,431 under such loans.

 

In order to extend the life of the Company, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officer and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan funds to the Company to deposit into the trust account in order to extend the period in which the Company has to consummate a business combination. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has borrowed $885,000 under these extension loans.

 

Our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 528,500 placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of $5,285,000. Each placement unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant. Each warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the founder shares, the placement shares, or the placement warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering. The placement units are identical to the units sold in the IPO except that the placement units and their component securities (a) will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination except to permitted transferees and (b) so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees, will be entitled to registration rights.

 

Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i) in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the completion of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activities and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within 15 months from the completion of this offering or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the 15-month period. However, our initial stockholders will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination or liquidate within the 15-month period.

 

On March 23, 2023, we held a Special Meeting of our stockholders seeking approval to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times (the “Charter Amendment”), each such extension for an additional one (1) month period from April 3, 2023 to April 3, 2024. We also sought approval to amend the investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 29, 2021, by and between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, allowing us to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period, until April 3, 2024, by depositing into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders the lesser of (A) $0.055 per non-redeeming publicly held share of common stock and (B) $150,000 (the “Extension Payment”) for each one-month extension. Both proposals were approved.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement we have entered into with our initial stockholders, we may be required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders, and holders of units issued upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, are entitled under the registration rights agreement to make up to three demands that we register certain of our securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements. See the section of this Annual Report entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

 

Our Charter Amendment following the March 28, 2024 Stockholders Meeting provides that we will have up to until December 29, 2024 through one-month Extensions to provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional $0.033 per share for each month, or as extended by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

 

Off-balance sheet financing arrangements

 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of December 31, 2023, there were no critical accounting policies.

 

Recent accounting standards

 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.

 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not required for smaller reporting companies.

 

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

 

This information appears following Item 15 of this Report and is included herein by reference.

 

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

                                                                   32

 

 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material weaknesses.

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the evaluation of the SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, and management’s subsequent re-evaluation of its Prior Financials, the Company determined that there were errors in its accounting for its complex financial instruments and related disclosure. Management concluded that a deficiency in inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping and that such failure constituted a material weakness.

 

Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of these inherent limitations, management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “2013 Framework”). Based on our evaluation under the 2013 Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material weaknesses. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented.

 

Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals.

 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   33

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors

 

Our board of directors consists of four directors. The term of office of each of directors will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders.

 

Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for a specific term of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that the board of directors shall elect one or more Chief Executive Officers, a Chief Financial Officer, a Secretary and such other officers (including without limitation, a Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries and a Treasurer) as the board of directors from time to time may determine. Any Chief Executive Officer or President may also appoint such other officers (including without limitation one or more Vice Presidents and Controllers) as may be necessary or desirable for the conduct of the business of the Company. Such other officers will have such powers and duties and shall hold their offices for such terms as may be provided in the bylaws or as may be prescribed by the board of directors or, if such officer has been appointed by any Chief Executive Officer or President, as may be prescribed by the appointing officer.

 

Director Independence

 

Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board has determined that all of our directors, other than Mr. Chan, are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.

 

                                                                   36

 

 

Committees of the Board of Directors

 

Our board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee.

 

Audit Committee

 

Our audit committee consists of Mr. Lim, Ms. Kou and Mr. Abelmann, and Mr. Lim chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Mr. Lim, Ms. Kou and Mr. Abelmann meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.

 

The Audit Committee’s duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public

           accounting firm engaged by

           us;

 

     ●    pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm

           engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and

           procedures;

 

     ●    setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm,

           including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and

           regulations;

 

     ●    setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

           matters required to be discussed by accounting and auditing standards, and recommending to the Board whether the audited

           financial statements should be included in our annual

           report;

 

     ●    obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i)

           the independent registered public accounting firm’s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by

           the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the independent registered public accounting firm, or by

           any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or

           more independent audits carried out by the independent registered public accounting firm and any steps taken to deal with

           such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the

           independent registered public accounting firm’s

           independence;

 

     ●    reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control policies and procedures on a regular basis;

 

     ●    reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K

           promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction;

           and

 

     ●    reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any

           legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any

           employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting

           policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards

           Board, the SEC or other regulatory

           authorities.

 

Financial Experts on Audit Committee

 

Pursuant to Nasdaq rules, the audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of “independent directors” who are able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.

 

                                                                   37

 

 

Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Lim qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules, which generally is any person who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual’s financial sophistication.

 

Compensation Committee

 

Our Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Lim, Ms. Kou and Mr. Abelmann each of whom is an independent director under the Nasdaq listing standards. Ms. Kou is the Chairperson of the compensation committee. The compensation committee’s duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s

           compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and

           approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer’s based on such

           evaluation;

 

     ●    reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers;

 

     ●    reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans;

 

     ●    implementing and administering our incentive compensation and equity-based remuneration plans;

 

     ●    assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;

 

     ●    approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our

           officers and

           employees;

 

     ●    retaining the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser, in the sole discretion of the compensation

           committee;

 

     ●    if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and

           

     ●    reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to our financial advisor of $10,000 per month, for up to 15 months, for office space , utilities and secretarial and administrative support, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements entered into in connection with such initial business combination.

 

The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.

 

Director Nominations

 

We do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. Our independent directors will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.

 

                                                                   38

 

 

The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.

 

We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders.

 

Code of Ethics

 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics as Exhibit 14.1 to this Annual Report. In addition, a copy of our Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K.

 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our shares of common stock and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons.

 

Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner.

 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

 

Employment Agreements

 

We have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment.

 

Executive Officers and Director Compensation

 

No executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.

 

                                                                   39

 

 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

 

None of our officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more officers serving on our board of directors.

 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

 

The following table sets forth as of April 16, 2024 the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock (ii) each of our officers and directors; and (iii) all of our officers and directors as a group. As of April 16, 2024, we had 2,664,791 shares of Class A common stock and 2,875,000 shares of Class B common stock, issued and outstanding. The Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment.

 

Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record of beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, as the warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of April 16, 2024.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

 

Founder Shares

 

On May 11, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. In June 2021, the Sponsor transferred 20,000 shares each to our Chief Executive Officer and David Kopp, 15,000 shares to our Chief Financial Officer and 10,000 shares to each of our independent director nominees. In July 2021, the Sponsor also transferred 431,250 shares to ARC Group Limited. In November 2021, ARC Group Limited transferred 140,400 shares to Max Mark Capital Limited, 140,400 shares to Jonathan Chan, and 10,000 shares to Mei Eng Goy. ARC Group Limited purchased its net 140,450 shares in consideration of services provided by such party as our financial advisor in connection with the Initial Public Offering. Each of the transfers above were completed at the same per share purchase price as the Sponsor paid for the founder shares, or $0.009.

 

The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of the Initial Public Offering (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to us by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. As of December 31, 2022, the Sponsor owned 2,358,750 shares of Class B common stock. Up to 375,000 of such shares held by our sponsor are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised. On January 3, 2022, as the underwriters’ over-allotment option has been exercised in full, 375,000 of such shares held by the Sponsor will not be subject to forfeiture.

 

The initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the shares of Class B common stock (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination and (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property.

 

                                                                   41

 

 

Promissory Note – Related Party

 

On May 10, 2021, the Sponsor issued to us an unsecured promissory note, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or the date on which we determine not to proceed with the Initial Public Offering. These amounts will be repaid shortly after completion of the Initial Public Offering out of the $660,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses. Following the IPO of the Company on January 3, 2022, a total of $122,352 under the promissory note was repaid on January 6, 2022 and therefore this note was terminated.

 

Working Capital Loans

 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has borrowed $522,431 and $91,124 under the Working Capital Loans, respectively.

 

General

 

Our Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.

 

Other than the payment to our financial advisor of $10,000 per month, for up to 15 months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination.

 

Related Party Policy

 

Our Code of Ethics, which we adopted on December 29, 2021, requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.

 

In addition, our audit committee, pursuant to a written charter that we adopted on December 29, 2021, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.

 

                                                                   42

 

 

These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.

 

To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our Sponsor, officers or directors unless we, or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, no finder’s fees, reimbursements, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors prior to, for services rendered to us prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).

 

However, the following payments will be made to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:

 

     ●    Repayment of up to an aggregate of $300,000 in loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational

           expenses;

 

     ●    Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business

           combination;

           and

 

     ●    Repayment of non-interest bearing loans which may be made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our

           officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms

           of which (other than as described above) have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect

           thereto. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the

           lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement

           units.

 

Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.

 

Director Independence

 

Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. For a description of the director independence, see “— Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance”.

 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

 

The following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to MaloneBailey, LLP (“MaloneBailey”) for services rendered.

 

Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by MaloneBailey in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of MaloneBailey for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 8-K for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC totaled $47,500 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $42,500 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings.

 

                                                                   43

 

 

Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not pay MaloneBailey any audit-related fees.

 

Tax Fees. The aggregate fees of MaloneBailey for tax return services, planning and tax advice for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3,500 and $0, respectively.

 

All Other Fees. We did not pay MaloneBailey for any other services for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 

Pre-Approval Policy

 

Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Aetherium Acquisition Corp.

 

Opinion on the Financial Statements

 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Aetherium Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 

Going Concern Matter

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. the Company’s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

Basis for Opinion

 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AETHERIUM ACQUISITION CORP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations

 

Aetherium Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 15, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (“Business Combination”). While the Company may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or sector or geographical location, the Company intends to focus on businesses in the education, training and education technology (“EdTech”) industries, specifically in Asia (excluding China). The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporate will provide that the Company shall not undertake an initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).

 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to the Company’s formation and the Initial Public Offering (as defined below) and searching for a target company. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.

 

The Company’s sponsor is Aetherium Capital Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s initial public offering was declared effective on December 29, 2021. On January 3, 2022, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”), and incurring offering costs of $6,762,886, of which $4,025,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 6). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On January 3, 2022, the over-allotment option was exercised in full.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 528,500 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,285,000 (the “Private Placement”) (see Note 4).

 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 3, 2022, an amount of $116,725,000 ($10.15 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below.

 

The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.

 

                                                                  F-7



 

 

AETHERIUM ACQUISITION CORP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued)

 

If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.

 

The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.15 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These shares of Class A common stock will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”

 

If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.

 

The Sponsor has agreed (a) to vote its shares of Class B common stock, the shares of Class A common stock included in the Placement Units (the “Placement Shares”) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Class B common stock) and Placement Units (including underlying securities) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek stockholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activities and (d) that the Class B common stock and Placement Units (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.

 

The Company had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (See Note 3) to consummate a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). On March 23, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period from April 3, 2023 to April 3, 2024, by depositing into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders the lesser of (A) $0.055 per non-redeeming publicly held share of common stock and (B) $150,000 (the “Extension Payment”) for each one-month extension. In connection with such proposal, stockholders elected to redeem 8,508,997 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), which represents approximately 74% of the shares that were part of the units that were sold in the Company’s IPO. Following such redemptions, 2,991,003 are subject to redemption. On each of April 3, May 3, July 11, and July 31, the Company’s Sponsor has deposited into the Company’s trust account $150,000 to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by six months from April 3, 2023 to October 3, 2023. On December 4, 2023, the Company deposited $300,000 into the Trust Account to further extend the period of time it has to consummate a business combination by six months from December 4, 2023 to June 4, 2024.

 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay the Company’s taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and their requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is the Company’s intention to redeem the Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 15th month and, therefore, the Company does not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, the Company’s stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of the Company’s stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

 

                                                                  F-8



 

 

AETHERIUM ACQUISITION CORP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued)

 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor (other than the independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below $10.15 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the company’s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

 

Liquidity and Management’s Plans

 

Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company has since completed its IPO at which time capital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working capital purposes. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management plans to address this uncertainty during the period leading up to the business combination. However, there is no assurance that the Company’s plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period.

 

Going Concern Consideration

 

In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the IPO, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.

 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.

 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination.

 

As a result of redemptions by the public stockholders in 2023, the Company accrued the 1% excise tax in the amount of $883,507 as a reduction of retained deficit.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying audited financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars and conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

 

Emerging Growth Company

 

The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.

 

                                                                  F-10

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $4 and $334 of cash in its operating bank account, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

 

Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account

 

The Company’s portfolio of investments is comprised solely of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligation. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in investment income earned on investment held in Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market Funds.

 

Offering Costs Associated with the Initial Public Offering

 

Offering costs consist of underwriting, legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Initial Public Offering executed on January 3, 2022 and that were charged to stockholders’ equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering.

 

Warrant Liabilities

 

The Company accounts for Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the Warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the Warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the Warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own shares of Class A Common Stock and whether the Warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding.

 

For issued or modified Warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the Warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified Warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the Warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.

 

As the warrants issued upon the Initial Public Offering and private placements meet the criteria for equity classification under ASC 815, therefore, the warrants are classified as equity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

 

Franchise Tax

 

Delaware, where the Company is incorporated, imposes a franchise tax that applies to most business entities that are formed or qualified to do business, or which are otherwise doing business, in Delaware. Delaware franchise tax is based on authorized shares or on assumed par and non-par capital, whichever yields a lower result. Under the authorized shares method, each share is taxed at a graduated rate based on the number of authorized shares. During years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company incurred $200,050 of franchise tax.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

 

The Company’s effective tax rate was (56.17%) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s effective tax rate was (49.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to transaction costs and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.

 

ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position.

 

The Company has identified the United States as its only “major” tax jurisdiction.

 

The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

 

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $930,584. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $207,733.

 

                                                                  F-11

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

 

Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and warrants issued as components of the Private Placement Units (the “Placement Warrants”) since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.

 

Net Income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, for Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss, adjusted for income attributable to Class A redeemable common stock shares, by the weighted average number of Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock shares outstanding for the period. Non-redeemable Class A and Class B common stock shares includes the Founder Shares and non-redeemable common stock shares as these shares do not have any redemption features and do not participate in the income earned on the Trust Account.

 

The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share:

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption

 

All of the Class A common stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders’ equity) to be less than $5,000,001. The Company’s Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. On April 10, 2023, $88,350,715 was paid to shareholders for redemption of 8,508,997 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 there is 2,991,003 and 11,500,000 Class A common shares, respectively, subject to possible redemption in the amount of $31,662,667 and $117,914,699, respectively,  at redemption value per Public Share are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. On December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.

 

                                                                  F-12

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 

Recent Accounting Standards

 

Management of the Company does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

 

Risks and Uncertainties

 

Management continues evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

Note 3 — Initial Public Offering

 

On January 3, 2022, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units (including the issuance of 1,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s full exercise of its over-allotment option), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.

 

Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (see Note 6).

 

As of January 3, 2022, the Company incurred offering costs of approximately $6,762,886, of which $4,025,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions.

 

Note 4 — Private Placement

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 528,500 Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit ($5,285,000 in the aggregate).

 

The proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO held in the Trust Account. The Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except for the placement warrants (“Placement Warrants”). If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless.

 

Note 5 — Related Party Transactions

 

Founder Shares

 

On May 11, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. In June 2021, the Sponsor transferred 20,000 shares each to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and David Kopp, 15,000 shares to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and 10,000 shares to each of the Company’s independent director nominees. In July 2021, the Sponsor also transferred 431,250 shares to ARC Group Limited. In November 2021, ARC Group Limited transferred 140,400 shares to Max Mark Capital Limited, 140,400 shares to Jonathan Chan, and 10,000 shares to Mei Eng Goy. ARC Group Limited purchased its net 140,450 shares in consideration of services provided by such party as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Initial Public Offering. Each of the transfers above were completed at the same per share purchase price as the Sponsor paid for the founder shares, or $0.009. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of the IPO (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Sponsor owned 2,358,750 shares of Class B common stock. As the underwriters’ over-allotment option has been exercised in full, 375,000 of such shares held by the Sponsor will not be subject to forfeiture.

 

                                                                  F-13



 

 

AETHERIUM ACQUISITION CORP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 5 — Related Party Transactions (Continued)

 

The initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the shares of Class B common stock (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination and (B) subsequent to the Company’s initial business combination, (x) if the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the Company’s initial business combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property.

 

Promissory Note – Related Party

 

On May 10, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or the date on which the Company determines not to proceed with the Initial Public Offering. These amounts will be repaid shortly after completion of the Initial Public Offering out of the $660,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses. Following the IPO of the Company on January 3, 2022, a total of $122,352 under the promissory note was repaid on January 6, 2022 and therefore the note was terminated.

 

Extension Loan

 

The Company had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (See Note 3) to consummate a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). On March 23, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period from April 3, 2023 to April 3, 2024, by depositing into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders the lesser of (A) $0.055 per non-redeeming publicly held share of common stock and (B) $150,000 (the “Extension Payment”) for each one-month extension. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 there was $885,000 and $0 outstanding under extension loans, respectively.

 

Working Capital Loans

 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company up to $3,500,000 funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has borrowed $522,431 outstanding under the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2022, there was $91,124 outstanding under the Working Capital Loans.

 

Administrative Services Arrangement

 

The Company’s financial advisor has agreed, commencing from the date that the Company’s securities are first listed on NASDAQ through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to make available to the Company certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative services, as the Company may require from time to time. The Company has agreed to pay the financial advisor $10,000 per month for these services. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has recognized $120,000 operating cost for the service provided by ARC Group Ltd. under this agreement .

 

Note 6 — Commitments and Contingencies

 

Registration Rights

 

The holders of the founder shares, as well as the holders of the Placement Units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued in payment of Working Capital Loans made to the Company, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that the Company register such securities at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

 

                                                                  F-14

The underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of: (i) two percent (2.00%) of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $2,300,000 as the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of three and one half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $4,025,000 upon closing of the Business Combination. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

 

On December 29, 2021, the underwriter gave the Company a rebatement of $500,000. So the cash underwriting fee for the Initial Public Offering was $1,800,000.

Holders of the Company’s Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share.

On January 3, 2022, as the underwriters’ over-allotment option has been exercised in full, 375,000 of such shares held by the Sponsor will not be subject to forfeiture. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 there were 2,875,000 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of the Company’s initial business combination on a one-for-one basis.

 

Preferred Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.

 

Warrants — Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the date of the final prospectus for our IPO and the completion of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock.

 

The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to satisfying the obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A common stock underlying such unit.

 

The Company has not registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, the Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, the Company will use best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Commpany will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.

 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the warrants for redemption:

 

     ●    in whole and not in part;

           

     ●    at a price of $0.01 per warrant;

           

     ●    upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants become exercisable (the “30-day

           redemption period”) to each warrant holder;

           and

           

     ●    if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted

           for stock splits, stock dividends, right issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading

           days within a 30-trading day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before

           we send the notice of redemption to the warrant

           holders.

 

If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise the redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. The Company will use best efforts to register or qualify such shares of common stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered in the IPO.

 

The Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering except the Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions.

 

Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements

 

The following table presents information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.

 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

 

          ●    Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;

                

          ●    Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable

                such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments

                in markets that are not active;

                and

                

          ●    Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to

                develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant

                inputs or significant value drivers are

                unobservable.

In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the change in the valuation allowance was $436,668 and $290,644, respectively.

Note 10 – Subsequent Events

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events”, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events or transactions that occurred through the date these financial statements were available to issue. Based upon this review, other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

 

The funds in the Trust Account have, from our initial public offering, through approximately February 1, 2024, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, on or about February 1, 2024, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, pursuant to the executed Second Amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to liquidate the investments in the money market funds held in the Trust Account immediately and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination or liquidation of the Company.

 

On March 28, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to thirty-six (36) months from the effectiveness date of the Company’s Form S-1 by the SEC, which was December 29, 2021, until December 29, 2024, by depositing into the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders $0.033 per non-redeeming publicly held share of common stock for each one-month extension.

 

In connection with such proposal, stockholders elected to redeem 1,383,212 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”). As a result, there will be an approximate payout of $15,229,164 (approximately $11.01 per share) that will be removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. This has not yet occurred as of the date these financial statements are issued. 

 

                                                                  F-16
