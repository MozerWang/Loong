DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

Note 1. Organization and Description of Business and Recent Developments

 

Organization and Description of Business

 

Dominari Holdings Inc. (the “Company”), formerly AIkido Pharma, Inc., was founded in 1967 as Spherix Incorporated. Since 2017, the Company has operated as a biotechnology company with a diverse portfolio of small-molecule anticancer and antiviral therapeutics and their related patent technology. The Company is in the process of winding down its historical pipeline of biotechnology assets held by Aikido Labs, LLC. In an effort to enhance shareholder value, in June of 2022, the Company formed a wholly owned financial services subsidiary, Dominari Financial Inc. (“Dominari Financial”), with the intent of shifting the Company’s primary operating focus away from biotechnology to the fintech and financial services industries. Through Dominari Financial, the Company acquired Dominari Securities LLC (“Dominari Securities”), an introducing broker-dealer, registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Dominari Securities provides investment advisory services and annuity and insurance products of certain insurance carriers as an insurance agency through independent and affiliated brokers. 

 

On September 9, 2022, Dominari Financial entered into a membership interest purchase agreement, as amended and restated on March 27, 2023 (the “FPS Purchase Agreement”) with Fieldpoint Private Bank & Trust (“Seller”), a Connecticut bank, for the purchase of its wholly owned subsidiary, Fieldpoint Private Securities, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (“FPS”), that is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and an investment adviser registered with the SEC.   Pursuant to the terms of the FPS Purchase Agreement, Dominari Financial purchased from the Seller 100% of the membership interests in FPS (the “Membership Interests”). FPS’s registered broker-dealer and investment adviser businesses will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominari Financial.  The FPS Purchase Agreement provides for Dominari Financial’s acquisition of FPS’s Membership Interests in two closings, the first of which occurred on October 4, 2022 (the “Initial Closing”), at which Dominari Financial paid to the Seller $2.0 million in consideration for a transfer by the Seller to Dominari Financial 20% of the FPS Membership Interests.   Following the Initial Closing, FPS filed a continuing membership application requesting approval for a change of ownership, control, or business operations with FINRA in accordance with FINRA Rule 1017 (the “Rule 1017 Application”).  The Rule 1017 Application was approved by FINRA on March 20, 2023. The second closing occurred on March 27, 2023. Dominari Financial paid to the Seller an additional $1.4 million in consideration for a transfer by the Seller to Dominari Financial of the remaining 80% of the Membership Interests. As a result of the ownership change, FPS was renamed Dominari Securities LLC.

 

Note 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The Company continues to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses, including public company expenses, in excess of corresponding (non-financing related) revenue. While the Company continues to implement its business strategy, it intends to finance its activities through managing current cash on hand from the Company’s past equity offerings.

 

Based upon projected cash flow requirements, the Company has adequate cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies from those previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and in conformity with the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, condensed consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited, but include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements; however, it does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

The Company’s policy is to consolidate all entities that it controls by ownership of a majority of the membership interest or outstanding voting stock. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Aikido Labs, Dominari Financial, and Dominari Securities. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. The Company’s significant estimates and assumptions include stock-based compensation, the valuation of investments, the valuation of notes receivable and the valuation allowance related to the Company’s deferred tax assets. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on the Company’s estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates and assumptions.

 

Deposits with clearing broker

 

Deposits with Dominari Securities’ clearing broker consisted of approximately $14.1 million held in money market funds and liquid insured deposits maintained by the Company with its clearing broker as of March 31, 2024.

 

Leases

 

The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset results in front-loaded expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred (see Note 8 - Leases).

Revenue

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.

 

The following provides detailed information on the recognition of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers:

 

     ●    Underwriting services include underwriting and placement agent services in both the equity and debt capital markets,

           including private equity placements, initial public offerings, follow-on offerings, and underwriting and distributing public

           and private debt. Underwriting and placement agent revenue are recognized at a point in time on trade-date, as the client

           obtains the control and benefit of the underwriting offering at that point. Costs associated with underwriting transactions

           are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded and are recorded on a gross

           basis within the general and administrative line item in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as

           the Company is acting as a principal in the arrangement. Any expenses reimbursed by the Company’s clients are recognized as

           other

           income.

 

     ●    Commissions are earned by executing transactions for clients primarily in equity, equity-related, and debt products.

           Commission revenue associated with trade execution are recognized at a point in time on trade-date. Commissions revenue are

           generally paid on settlement date and the Company records receivables to account for timing between trade-date and payment

           on settlement

           date.

 

     ●    Account advisory fees are earned in connection with investment advisory services.  Account advisory fees are recognized over

           time using the time elapsed method as the Company determined that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the

           benefits of investment advisory services as they are provided. Account advisory fees are generally paid in advance of a

           specified service period (e.g. quarterly) and are initially deferred within in our Condensed Consolidated Balance

           Sheet.

 

     ●    Other revenue includes placement agent services in the equity capital markets for privately held companies distributing

           private equity. Placement agent revenue are recognized at a point in time on trade-date, as the client obtains the control

           and benefit of the membership interest offering at that

           point.

 

Long-term equity investments 

 

The Company accounts for long-term equity investments under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 321 “Investments—Equity Securities” (“ASC 321”). In accordance with ASC 321, equity securities with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either at fair value or using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the equity investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the Company. 

 

Recently adopted accounting standards

 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”). This update amends Topic 805 to add contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and to require that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with ASC 606. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2023. There was no material impact to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the implementation of ASU 2021-08.

 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, to clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring the fair value of the equity security. ASU 2022-03 also clarifies that an entity cannot recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction as a separate unit of account. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 may be early adopted and are effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2022-03 on January 1, 2024. There was no material impact to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the implementation of ASU 2022-03.

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases, to require entities to classify and account for leases with related parties on the basis of legally enforceable terms and conditions of the arrangement. The amendments are effective in periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2023-01 on January 1, 2024. There was no material impact to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the implementation of ASU 2023-01.

 

Effect of new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in future periods

 

The Company reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

 

Financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

 

9

 

 

The Company uses three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

 

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 

Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable

 

Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)

 

Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment.

Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock as of the first day of the period. Securities that could potentially dilute loss per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 are as follows:

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

 

Legal Proceedings

 

In March 2024, the Company received a notice of petition of a filed action seeking relief related to the hiring in March 2024 of new registered representatives from the representatives’ former employer. This notice was filed against the Company’s subsidiary, Dominari Securities. The Company does not agree with the plaintiff’s claims. While the Company intends to defend itself vigorously from this claim, it is unable to predict the outcome of such legal proceeding. Any potential loss as a result of this legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated. As a result, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency for the aforementioned claim.

 

In the past, in the ordinary course of business, the Company actively pursued legal remedies to enforce its intellectual property rights and to stop unauthorized use of the Company’s technology. Other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, the Company is not aware of any material, active or pending legal proceedings brought against it.

Note 13. Regulatory

 

Dominari Securities, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered with the SEC as an introducing broker-dealer and is a member of FINRA. The Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. As such, the subsidiary is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the SEC and has elected to calculate minimum capital requirements using the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3-1. As of March 31, 2024, Dominari Securities had net capital of approximately $13.4 million, which was approximately $13.3 million in excess of required minimum net capital of $0.1 million.

 

Note 14. Related Party Transaction

 

In 2021, the Company engaged the services of Revere Securities, LLC (“Revere”) to strategically manage and build the Company’s investment processes. Kyle Wool, Board Member, was previously a member of the board of directors of Revere. The Company incurred fees of approximately $0 and $80,000 during the three months ending March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These fees were included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

Note 15. Segment Reporting

 

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: (1) Dominari Financial and (2) Legacy AIkido. The Dominari Financial reportable business segment represents the Company’s broker-dealer business, which is composed of mostly underwriting and transactional service activities. The Legacy AIkido reportable business segment includes Aikido Labs, which manages the investments holdings of the legacy entity. Prior to the FPS Acquisition, the Company operated as a single operating segment comprised of Legacy AIkido.

 

The chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) has access to and regularly reviews internal financial reporting for each business and uses that information to make operational decisions and allocate resources. Accounting policies applied by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the Company and described in the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” While assets are primarily held within the Legacy AIkido reportable business segment, total assets by segment is not disclosed as the CODM does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets.

 

The measures of segment profitability that are most relied upon by the CODM are gross revenue and net loss, as presented within the table below and reconciled to the statement of operations.

Note 16. Income Taxes

 

The Company recorded no income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 because the estimated annual effective tax rate was zero. In determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate, the Company analyzes various factors, including projections of the Company’s annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, the ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives.

 

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Results of Operations

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized approximately $1.4 million in revenue from operations, primarily driven by the commissions and underwriting revenue earned by Dominari Securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of approximately $2.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily general and administrative expenses related to the process of winding down the assets held by Aikido Labs, LLC and was offset by a calendar year loss of $1.3 million from operations in the operations of Dominari Securities.

 

     i.   There is a $1.0 million decrease in net operating loss during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to same period

           in 2023, which was driven by $2.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for Aikido segment and was offset

           by $1.3 million loss from operations Dominari Financial segment during the three months ended March 31,

           2024.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, other (expenses) income was approximately $(2.6) million and $72,000, respectively. The activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, is primarily a result of overall volatility in investment valuations due to macroeconomic uncertainty (i.e. inflation, global tensions in the Ukraine and etc.) impacting marketable securities and the change in fair value of long-term equity investments. Specifically:

 

     i.   Marketable securities – we recognized a gain of approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The

           increase of approximately $0.6 million in gains over the prior period is driven by both market improvement and an increase

           in sale activity resulting in more realized

           gains.

           

     ii.  Notes receivable – the changes over the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are a function of observable market

           transactions which resulted in an increase in unrealized loss of approximately $0.9 million on the adjusted fair value of

           our notes receivable during the three months ended March 31,

           2024.

           

     iii. Long-term equity investments –the changes over the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are a function of observable

           market transactions which resulted in an increase in unrealized loss of approximately $2.5 million on the adjusted fair

           value of the investments during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses, including public company expenses. While we continue to implement our business strategy, we intend to finance our activities through:

 

     ●    managing current cash and cash equivalents on hand from our past debt and equity offerings;

 

     ●    seeking additional funds raised through the sale of additional securities in the future; and

 

     ●    seeking additional liquidity through credit facilities or other debt arrangements.

 

Our ultimate success is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis. Our business may require significant amounts of capital to sustain operations that we need to execute our longer-term business plan to support our transition into the financial services industry. Our working capital amounted to approximately $23.8 million as of March 31, 2024. We believe our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. In the event that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our operations, as expected, or if our plans or assumptions change, including if inflation begins to have a greater impact on our business or if we decide to move forward with any activities that require more outlays of cash than originally planned, we may need to raise additional capital sooner than expected. We may raise this additional capital by obtaining additional debt or equity financing, especially if we experience downturns in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated, or if we experience significant increases in expense levels resulting from being a publicly traded company or from continuing operations.

 

Our ability to obtain capital to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend on our future operating performance, financial condition and, more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing. Capital availability will be affected by prevailing conditions in our industry, the global economy, the global financial markets, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Specifically, as a result of recent volatility and weakness in the public markets, due to, among other factors, uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, it may be much more difficult to raise additional capital, if and when it is needed, unless the public markets become less volatile and stronger at such time that we seek to raise additional capital. In addition, any additional debt service requirements we take on could be based on higher interest rates and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders.

 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operations was approximately $8.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, is primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately $5.4 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 million, partially offset by approximately $2.5 million of change in fair value of long-term equity investment. The cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, is primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately $3.8 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million, partially offset by approximately $0.1 million in unrealized losses on marketable securities and approximately $0.06 million of realized loss on marketable securities. 

 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was approximately $7.7 million and $(18.7) million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily resulted from our sales of marketable securities of approximately $8.8 million, partially offset by funds to employee forgivable loan of $1.3 million. The Company also collected approximately $0.3 million in principal related to its short-term notes.  The cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily resulted from our purchase of marketable securities of approximately $17.5 million and the acquisition of FPS of approximately $1.1 million. The Company also collected approximately $0.3 million in principal related to its short-term notes. 

 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, there is no cash flows from financing activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was approximately $0.9 million, which reflects the cost for purchase of treasury stock of approximately $0.9 million.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal controls.

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonably possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls

 

The Company’s management has concluded that our control around the accounting for certain notes receivable accounted for at fair value and certain long-term investments accounted for at fair value or with the equity security measurement alternative was not effectively designed or maintained, and therefore initially were not accounted for correctly. As a result, our management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management understands that the accounting standards applicable to our financial statements are complex and will seek to enhance controls over its experienced third-party professionals with whom management can consult with respect to accounting issues and remediate this material weakness.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

We have not made any changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

 

Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

Part II - Other Information

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

Many aspects of the Company’s business involve substantial risks of liability. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be named as defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, which could create substantial exposure and periodic expenses. The Company may also be involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company’s business, which may result in expenses, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In the past in the ordinary course of business, we actively pursued legal remedies to enforce our intellectual property rights and to stop unauthorized use of our technology. 

 

In March 2024, the Company received a notice of petition of a filed action seeking relief related to the hiring in March 2024 of new registered representatives from the representatives’ former employer. This notice was filed against the Company’s subsidiary Dominari Securities. The Company does not agree with the claim of the plaintiff and will defend itself accordingly. While the Company intends to defend itself vigorously from this claim, it is unable to predict the outcome of such legal proceeding. Any potential loss as a result of this legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated. As a result, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency for the aforementioned claim.

 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. Our current risk factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Any of our previously disclosed risk factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.
