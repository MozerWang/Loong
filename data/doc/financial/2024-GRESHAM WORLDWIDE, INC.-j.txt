FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, including our liquidity, our receipt of future orders and whether our backlog will result in orders. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology including “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predict,” “should” or “will” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Report is filed, and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results, unless required by law.

 

This Report also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties and contained in this Report and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do generally believe the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of risks and uncertainties due to a variety of factors, including that (i) we  will continue to secure orders and backlog in 2024 and that our Giga-tronics legacy business development efforts to generate new orders will improve, (ii) we will secure adequate cash to bridge operations, (iii) the ongoing geopolitical military conflict (including, the war in Israel, the Russian war on Ukraine, and tensions with China and Taiwan) will continue, (iv) supply chain turmoil and inflation will continue to affect customer demand for our product offerings, (v) defense budgets for electronic technology solutions that we provide will not decrease, (vi) our key medical customer will not reduce expected orders, (vii) the effect that  the slowdown in the capital markets and securities offerings for micro cap companies which are not listed on a leading national securities exchange will have on our ability to raise capital, and (viii) those other risks described in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and throughout this Report. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of Business

Gresham Worldwide, Inc., formerly Giga-tronics, Incorporated (“Gresham” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and distributes purpose-built electronics equipment, automated test solutions, power electronics, supply and distribution solutions, as well as radio, microwave and millimeter wave communication systems and components for a variety of applications with a focus on the global defense industry and the healthcare market. 

Gresham has two subsidiaries Gresham Holdings, Inc. (“Gresham Holdings”) and Microsource Inc. (“Microsource”). Gresham has also one division. Gresham is a majority-owned subsidiary of Ault Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“AAI”) and currently operates as an operating segment of AAI. Gresham Holdings has three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gresham Power Electronics Ltd. (“Gresham Power”), Relec Electronics Ltd. (“Relec”), and Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (“Enertec”), and one majority-owned subsidiary, Microphase Corporation (“Microphase”). Our operations consist of three business segments:

•Radio Frequency Solutions (“RF Solutions”) – consists of Microphase which is located in Connecticut. Microphase designs and manufactures custom microwave hardware products for military applications and generates revenue primarily through production contracts for custom engineered components and RADAR filters.

•Precision Electronic Solutions – consists of two subsidiaries and one division. The subsidiaries are Enertec located in Israel and Microsource located in California. The division is what we call our Giga-tronics Division. Enertec develops and supplies advanced command & control, test and calibration systems for use in failsafe military and medical applications. The legacy business of Giga-tronics (the “Giga-tronics Business”) consists of Microsource, a wholly-owned subsidiary which develops and manufactures sophisticated RADAR filters used in fighter aircraft, and our Giga-tronics Division which markets “EW Test and Training”, which serves the defense electronics market with a signal generation platform.

•Power Electronics & Displays – consists of two subsidiaries, namely Relec and Gresham Power located in the United Kingdom (the “UK”) which primarily engineer and provide integrated, mobile power electronics and display solutions that distribute and supply continuous, dependable, clean low voltage power. 

Gresham was incorporated in California on March 5, 1980 as Giga-tronics Incorporated. We changed our name to Gresham effective March 1, 2024. Our common stock continues to trade under the Giga-tronics name and symbol “GIGA” on the OTCQB. We have obtained shareholder approval to reincorporate in Delaware. Both our name change on the OTCQB and reincorporation are subject to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approval.

 

Note 2. Liquidity and Financial Condition

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred recurring net losses and operations have not provided cash flows. In view of these matters, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to finance its future development activities and its working capital needs largely through the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from other sources, including term notes until such time as funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been funded by our parent company, AAI. The extent of continued support from AAI is not assured as we seek additional financing from third parties. There is substantial doubt that we will have sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next 12 months. Our ability to obtain additional financing is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor and lender sentiment with respect to us and our industry. If we are unable to raise additional financing in the near term as needed, our operations and production plans may be scaled back or curtailed and our operations and growth would be impeded.

Our near term fixed commitments for cash expenditures are primarily for payments for employee salaries, operating leases, accounts payables, and inventory purchase commitments.

Note 9. Fair value of financial instruments

Recurring Fair Value Measurements:

The Company assesses the inputs used to measure fair value using the three-tier hierarchy based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. For investments where little or no public market exists, management’s determination of fair value is based on the best available information which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration various factors including earnings history, financial condition, recent sales prices of the issuer’s securities and liquidity risks.

Below are the changes to level 3 measured liabilities:

Note 10. Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Warrants

Notes

The Company elected the fair value option with respect to the Convertible Notes. The fair value of the liability was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company used the probability-weighted expected return method (“PWERM”) to arrive at a fair value. This approach involved the estimation of future potential outcomes for the Convertible Notes, as well as values and probabilities associated with each respective potential outcome. The Company assigned a 100% default probability to the senior secured convertible notes as of March 31, 2024 since the Company is in default on the senior secured convertible notes

The Company arrived at the fair value of the Notes liability as shown below:

The Company calculated the present value of the senior secured convertible notes payoff on the maturity date using the income approach, which focuses on the income-producing capability of a business and estimated value based on the expectation of future cash flows. The significant assumptions associated with the fair value of the senior secured convertible notes, related party as of the dates indicated, are as follows:

Note 16. Net Loss Per Share

 

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period (excluding outstanding stock options). Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the potential effect of dilutive securities which are convertible into common shares (using the treasury stock method), except in cases in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share:

For the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, because the Company was in a loss position, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share as the inclusion of the potential common shares would have been anti-dilutive.

The following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation above because to do so would be anti-dilutive for the periods indicated:

•Power Electronics & Displays – consists of two subsidiaries, namely Gresham Power and Relec located in the UK which primarily engineer and provide integrated, mobile power electronics and display solutions that distribute and supply continuous, dependable, clean low voltage power. 

We are focused on products that are getting designed into military systems such as fighter jets, ships and ground vehicles or missiles, which provide a recurring revenue stream for years to come and eliminate competition because the cost of replacing designed in products is prohibitive for both the competition and the customer.

Recent Trends and Uncertainties

 

We are in the process of aggressively managing our cash flow and reducing our expenses. As part of this endeavor, in March 2024 we implemented a reduction in our work force and recently moved to a smaller facility in California. We continue to have working capital issues. See “Risk Factors” in the 2023 Annual Report.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In reading and understanding this discussion of results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, you should be aware of key policies, judgments and assumptions that are important to the portrayal of financial conditions and results.

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 3 of Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts. These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.

The Precision Electronic Solutions group generated net revenue of $5.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, a 29% increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was due to Enertec’s defense business which obtained a large contract related to a missile defense system for NATO countries. The Power Electronics & Displays group had a decline in revenue by 20% to $2.4 million primarily due to a decrease in shipments by Gresham Power which completed two large defense contracts in 2023. The RF solutions group increased revenue by 17% to $2.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a large filter contract from a US prime contractor.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

A Non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (”SEC”) as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that includes or excludes amounts from the most directly comparable measure under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are excluded from these measures.

We measure our operating performance in part based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). We also measure our operating performance based on “Adjusted EBITDA,” which we define as EBITDA adjusted for net other income or expense items, share based compensation and certain one-time income or expense items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that are commonly used, but neither is a recognized accounting term under GAAP. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to monitor and facilitate internal evaluation of the performance of our business operations, to facilitate external comparison of our business results to those of others in our industry, and to plan and evaluate our operating budgets. We believe that our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to the investing public regarding our operating performance and our ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures and may help investors understand and compare our results to other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, but as a supplement to, income or loss from operations, net income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In the following reconciliation, we provide amounts as reflected in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted.

In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

During the three month ended March 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $132,000 as compared to cash used of $2.7 million for the three month ended March 31, 2023. The primary reduction in the use of cash was a combination lower inventories, and higher accounts payables.

We expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our level of revenue, which fluctuates significantly from one period to another primarily due to the timing of receipt of contracts, operating results, amounts of non-cash charges, and the timing of our inventory purchases, billings, collections and disbursements.

 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

20



 

Cash used in investing activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 was $237,000 which was due to the purchase of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the three months period ended March 31, 2023 was $27,000 which was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment.

 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 was $584,000 which was primarily due to $952,000 proceeds from issuance of senior secured convertible notes, related party which was offset by $388,000 payments on notes payable. Cash provided by financing activities for the three months period ended March 31, 2023 was $2.9 million which was due to the capital contributions from AAI.

Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been funded by AAI and in January 2023 by two other lenders who lent the Company $3.0 million. Without the availability of working capital from AAI, unless we are successful in securing additional financing from third parties, we believe that we will not have sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next 12 months – See “Risk Factors” in the 2023 Annual Report.

Even though we have reduced our operations in California and elsewhere, we need to complete a material financing which will provide the working capital to support our business. In addition, we must obtain a financing to repay the $4.6 million senior secured convertible notes (see Note 10. Senior Secured Notes and Warrants) due this fall on which we defaulted. Any financing will likely have onerous terms and be dilutive of our stockholders. 

As of May 10, 2024, the Company has approximately $3.6 million in cash.

Our ability to obtain additional financing is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor and lender sentiment with respect to us and our industry. If we are unable to raise additional financing in the near term as needed, our operations and production plans may be scaled back or curtailed and our operations and growth would be impeded.

Our near term fixed commitments for cash expenditures are primarily for payments for employee salaries, operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. Due to the deterioration of the Giga-tronics Division including its Microsource subsidiary, we have lacked sufficient capital to pay our payables. To assist with our liquidity issues, our executive officers have agreed to defer their salaries for two pay periods. In addition we also borrowed a total of $50,000 from our Chief Financial Officer. 

As a result of our liquidity issues, we need to raise approximately $5.0 million to meet our short-term working capital needs, not including the $4.6 million we owe which is due on October 11, 2024. While we are engaged in discussions with AAI and another lender about possible solutions, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in solving our liquidity issues.

ITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K, the Company, as a smaller reporting company, is not required to provide the information required by this item.

ITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon our evaluation, each of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q due to the material weaknesses as described herein.

A material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) Auditing Standard No. 2) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following material weaknesses:

•The Company does not have sufficient resources in its accounting function, which restricts its ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. 

•Due to its size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transaction should be performed by separate individuals.

•Our primary user access controls (i.e., provisioning, de-provisioning, privileged access and user access reviews) to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented effectively. We did not design and/or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems affecting our processes.

• Management concluded that a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting existed relating to the accounting treatment for complex financial instruments and that the failure to properly account for such instruments constituted a material weakness.

 Planned Remediation

Management continues to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding our information technology systems and applications. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate material weaknesses, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) enhancing design and documentation related to both user access and change management processes and control activities; and (ii) developing and communicating additional policies and procedures to govern the area of information technology change management.

We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate material weaknesses, including the following:

  ·Formalizing our internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our management; and

 

  ·When there are business operations and cash to justify the additional expenses, adding additional accounting personnel and

    segregating duties amongst accounting

    personnel.

We are currently working to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

Despite the existence of these material weaknesses, we believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as detailed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has no material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS

Because the holder of a $2,300,000 senior secured convertible note recently declared its note in default, that note and another note must be paid  in 2024 unless extended, and we have a working capital deficit, without completing a material financing we may have to cut back or sell some of our operations.
