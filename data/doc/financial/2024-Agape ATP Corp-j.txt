1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND (Continued)

 

Business Overview

 

Agape ATP Corporation is a company that provides health and wellness products and health solution advisory services to our clients. The Company primarily focus its efforts on attracting customers in Malaysia. Its advisory services center on the “ATP Zeta Health Program”, which is a health program designed to effectively prevent diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy lifestyles, and promotion of health. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity in our clients through a combination of modern medicine, proper nutrition and advice from skilled nutritionists and/or dieticians.

 

In order to strengthen the Company’s supply chain, on May 8, 2020, the Company has successfully acquired approximately 99.99% of ASL, with the goal of securing an established network marketing sales channel that has been established in Malaysia for the past 15 years. ASL has been offering the Company’s ATP Zeta Health Program as part of its product lineup. As such, the acquisition creates synergy in the Company’s operation by boosting the Company’s retail and marketing capabilities. The newly acquired subsidiary allows the Company to fulfill its mission of “helping people to create health and wealth” by providing a financially rewarding business opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and customers who seek a healthy lifestyle.

 

Via ASL, the Company offers four series of programs which consist of different services and products: ATP Zeta Health Program, ÉNERGÉTIQUE, BEAUNIQUE and E.A.T.S.

 

The ATP Zeta Health Program is a health program designed to promote health and general wellbeing designed to prevent health diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy lifestyles. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity through a combination of modern health supplements, proper nutrition and advice from skilled dieticians as well as trained members and distributors.

 

The ÉNERGÉTIQUE series aims to provide a total dermal solution for a healthy skin beginning from the cellular level. The series is comprised of the Energy Mask series, Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Mousse Facial Cleanser.

 

The BEAUNIQUE product series focuses on the research of our diet’s impact on modifying gene expressions in order to address genetic variations and deliver a nutrigenomic solution for every individual.

 

The E.A.T.S is crafted to bring nutritious lifestyle in convenient approach to maintain healthy living.

 

The Company deems creating public awareness on wellness and wellbeing lifestyle as essential to enhance the provision of its health solution advisory services; and therefore, incorporated WATP. Upon its establishment, WATP started collaborating with ASL to carry out various wellness programs.

 

To further its reach in the Health and Wellness Industry, on November 11, 2021, Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan) formed an entity, DSY Wellness International Sdn. Bhd. (“DSY Wellness”) with an independent third party which Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan) owns 60% of the equity interest, to pursue the business of providing complementary health therapies.

 

                                                                  F-7

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of presentation

 

The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

The interim unaudited financial information as of March 31, 2024 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and pursuant to Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP, have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The interim unaudited financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company’s unaudited financial position as of March 31, 2024, its unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and its unaudited cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, as applicable, have been made. The unaudited interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and its variable interest entity (“VIE”) over which the Company exercises control and, where applicable, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and its VIE have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

Principles of consolidation

 

Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power; or has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of directors.

 

A VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, SEA, the only VIE of the Company has no significant operations.

 

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance for inventories obsolescence, impairment of long-lived assets and allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

 

Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, time deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

 

                                                                  F-8

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Accounts receivable

 

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any uncollectible accounts and do not bear interest, which are due on credit term. The carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects the Company’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. An allowance for credit losses is recorded in the period when a loss is probable based on an assessment of collectivity by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist, primarily base on similar business line, service or product offerings and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectivity issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical collectivity based on past due status, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect the Company’s ability to collect from customers. Accounts receivable balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company’s management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $527 and $542 allowance of credit losses were recorded.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out method. Management reviews inventory on hand for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable items, as compared to future demand requirements and the shelf life of the various products. Based on the review, the Company records inventory write-downs, when necessary, when costs exceed expected net realizable value. The Company did not recognize any inventory write-downs nor inventory write-off for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Prepaid taxes

 

Prepaid taxes include prepaid income taxes that will either be refunded or utilized to offset future income tax.

 

Prepayments and deposits

 

Prepayments and deposits are mainly cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for future inventory purchases or service providers for future services. This amount is refundable and bears no interest. For any prepayments and deposits determined by management that such advances will not be in receipts of inventories, services, or refundable, the Company will recognize an allowance account to reserve such balances. Management reviews its prepayments and deposits on a regular basis to determine if the allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance for credit losses after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. The Company’s management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance policy and update it if necessary. There were no allowance for credit losses written-off during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. There was no allowance for credit losses recorded as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Property and equipment, net

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets with no residual value. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

 

                                                                  F-9

The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred, while additions, renewals and betterments, which are expected to extend the useful life of assets, are capitalized. The Company also re-evaluates the periods of depreciation to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.

 

Intangible assets, net

 

Intangible assets, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is recognized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Impairment for long-lived assets

 

Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is identified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no impairment of long-lived assets was recognized.

 

Investment in marketable securities

 

The Company follows the provisions of ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Investments in marketable equity securities (non-current) are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the caption of “unrealized holding gain (loss) on marketable securities” in each reporting period.

Customer deposits

 

Customer deposits represent amounts advanced by customers on product orders and unapplied unexpired coupons. Customer deposits are reduced when the related sale is recognized in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy.

 

Revenue recognition

 

On July 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606). The core principle underlying the revenue recognition of this ASU allows the Company to recognize - revenue that represents the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are recognized at a point in time for the Company’s sale of health and wellness products.

 

The ASU requires the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.

 

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of substantially collection.

 

                                                                  F-11

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Sales of Health and Wellness products

 

- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time

 

The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when control of the health and wellness products are transferred to its customer at the Company’s office or shipment of the goods. The revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and return allowances. Products are given 60 days for returns or exchanges from the date of purchase. Historically, there were insignificant sales returns.

 

Under the Company’s network marketing business, the Company issues product coupons to members and distributors when these customers made purchases above certain thresholds set by the Company. Depending on the type of product coupons issued, the coupons carry varying values and can be used by the customers for reduction in the transaction price of product purchases within the coupon validity period. The value of the product coupons issued is recorded as a reduction of the Company’s revenue account upon issuance; the corresponding amount credited to the customer deposits account. Amounts in customer deposits will be reversed when the coupons are used. The Company’s coupons have a validity period of between six and twelve months. If the Company’s customers did not utilize the coupons after the validity period, the Company would recognize the forfeiture of the originated sales value of the coupons as net revenues.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $2,217 and $22,959, as forfeited coupon income, respectively.

 

The Company had contracts for the sales of health and wellness products amounting to $11,879 which it is expected to fulfill within 12 months from March 31, 2024.

 

Sales of products for the provision of complementary health therapies

 

Products for the provision of complementary health therapies are predominantly Chinese herbs in different forms, processed or otherwise, for prescriptions for treating non-communicable diseases.

 

Provision of Health and Wellness services

 

- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time

 

The Company carries out its Wellness program, where the Company’s products are bundled with health screening test and a health camp program. The health screening test and the health camp programs are considered as separate performance obligations. The promises to deliver the health screening test report and the attendance at the health camp are separately identifiable, which are evidenced by the fact that the Company provides separate services of delivering the health screening test report and allowing admission of the customers to attend the health camp.

 

The Company based on the health screening test contracts with customers, establishes the selling price for the health screening test and place order to the health screening center. The Company obtains control of the test report before they are delivered to the customers. The Company analyze the test report, provides consultations to the customers, bundle it with the Company’s products and services depending on the customer’s needs.

 

The Company also separately derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the health camp program was completed in the final day of the health camp. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, revenues from health and wellness services were $50,934 and $65,351 respectively.

 

                                                                  F-12

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Commission expenses

 

As with all companies in the network marketing industry, the Company’s sales channel is external to the Company. The Company’s “external sales force” is stratified into two levels based on priority recruitment. First, there are sales distributors. Second, all members recruited by a sales distributor, directly or indirectly, are referred to as “sales network members”. The Company pays commission to every sales distributor based on purchases made by its sales network members which includes the independent direct sales members. Top performing distributors with their own physical stores may also become stockists of the Company, whereby they enjoy benefits such as maintaining a certain amount of the Company’s inventory on their store premises. The stockists shall account to the Company for all products sales from their store premises as monitored through the Company’s centralized stock tracking system. The Company pays a separate commission to stockists based on revenue generated from the stockists’ physical stores. Commission expenses amounted to $9,344 and $33,942 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Defined contribution plan

 

The full-time employees of the Company are entitled to the government mandated defined contribution plan. The Company is required to accrue and pay for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ respective salaries, subject to certain ceilings, in accordance with the relevant government regulations, and make cash contributions to the government mandated defined contribution plan. Total expenses for the plans were $30,087 and $43,713 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

The related contribution plans include:

 

     -    Social Security Organization (“PERKESO”) – 1.75% based on employee’s monthly salary capped of RM 5,000;

     -    Employees Provident Fund (“EPF”) –based on employee’s monthly salary, 13% for employee earning RM5,000 and below; and 12%

           for employee earning RM5,001 and

           above.

     -    Employment Insurance System (“EIS”) – 0.2% based on employee’s monthly salary capped of RM 5,000;

     -    Human Resource Development Fund (“HRDF”) – 1% based on employee’s monthly salary

 

Income taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP for income taxes. The charge for taxation is based on the results for the fiscal year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

 

Deferred tax is accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.

 

                                                                  F-14

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.

 

An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. No penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

The Company conducts much of its business activities in Hong Kong and Malaysia and is subject to tax in each of these jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.

 

Comprehensive income (loss)

 

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Net income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of a foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company not using the U.S. dollar as its functional currencies.

 

Non-controlling interest

 

Non-controlling interest consists of 40% of the equity interests of DSY Wellness held by an individual and approximately 0.01% (3 ordinary shares out of 9,590,599 shares) of the equity interests of ASL held by three individuals. The non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheets, separately from equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Company are presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations as an allocation of the total income or loss for the periods between non-controlling interest holders and the shareholders of the Company.

 

Earnings (loss) per share

 

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”. ASC 260 requires companies to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income (loss) divided by the weighted average ordinary share outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of the potential common stocks (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common stocks that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no dilutive shares.

 

                                                                  F-15

Foreign currencies translation and transaction

 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. The Company’s subsidiary in Labuan maintains its books and record in United States Dollars (“US$”) albeit its functional currency being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates, which is the Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”). The Company’s subsidiary in Hong Kong maintains its books and record in Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), similar to its functional currency. The Company’s subsidiary and VIE in Malaysia conducts its businesses and maintains its books and record in the local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR” or “RM”), as its functional currency.

 

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements of stockholders’ equity. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods, therefore, amounts reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets.

 

Translation of foreign currencies into US$1 have been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Related parties

 

Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.

 

Fair value of financial instruments

 

The accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company.

 

The accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:

 

     ●    Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

           markets.

     ●    Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and

           inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of

           the financial

           instruments.

     ●    Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.

 

Financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest.

 

Leases

 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), and elected the practical expedients that does not require the Company to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are, or contain, leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. For lease terms of twelve months or fewer, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. The Company also adopts the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of a lease as a single lease component. Some of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, which is typically at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options, and, when it is reasonably certain of exercise, it will include the renewal period in its lease term. New lease modifications result in re-measurement of the right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. Operating ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company use its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.

 

                                                                  F-17

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 

Lease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

The Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and includes the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.

 

Derivative financial instruments

 

Derivative financial instruments consist of financial instruments that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying variables such as interest rate, security price, variable conversion rate or other variables, require no initial new investment and permit net settlement. The derivative financial instruments may be free-standing or embedded in other financial instruments. The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company based on the terms of the warrant agreement to determine the warrants as equity instruments or derivative liabilities. The Company follows the provision of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging for derivative financial instruments that are classified as equity instruments, the contracts are initially measured at fair value and no subsequent measurement is required for equity instruments. The Company uses Black-Scholes Model to calculate the fair value of the warrant.

 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (“ASUs”). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued.

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. The ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

                                                                  F-18

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

 

In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01 “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards”. The ASU clarify how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, by adding illustrative guidance. The guidance in ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and can be applied either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date at which the entity first applies the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 “Codification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements”. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

 

Recently adopted Accounting Pronouncements

 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01 “Leases (Topic 842) Common Control Arrangements”. This ASU provides guidance in ASC Topic 842 that Leasehold improvements associated with common control leases should be (i) amortized by the lessee over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease, and (ii) accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if and when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The ASU 2023-01 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption of this accounting standard has no material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended and as at March 31, 2024.

 

Except for the above-mentioned pronouncements, there are no new recent issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.

 

3. ACQUISITION OF OIE ATPC HOLDINGS (M) SDN. BHD.

 

On January 3, 2024, the Company together with Oriental Industries Enterprise (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“OIE”) form an equity method investment entity, OIE ATPC Holdings (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“OIE ATPC”) in which the Company and OIE each owns 50% equity interest at the cost of $108. On March 14, 2024, the Company acquired the remainder 50% of equity at cost of $107 from OIE.

 

On January 8, 2024, OIE ATPC form a wholly own entity, OIE ATPC Exim (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“ATPC Exim”).

 

As both OIE ATPC and ATPC Exim are newly formed, the Company considered the cost of investment is the fair value of the assets acquired.

 

4. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (“VIE”)

 

SEA is a trading company incorporated on March 4, 2004, under the laws of Malaysia. SEA provided majority of ASL’s purchases. Its equity at risk was insufficient to finance its activities and 100% of its business is transacted with ASL. Therefore, it was considered to be a VIE and ASL is the primary beneficiary since it has both of the following characteristics:

 

     a.   The power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and

     b.   The obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits

           from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the

           VIE.

 

Accordingly, the accounts of SEA is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.

 

                                                                  F-19

The Company requires all members and distributors of its network marketing business to maintain an electronic wallet (eWallet) account with the Company. The eWallet is primarily for the crediting of any commission payment that falls below RM100 (or $22.70). Commission payment exceeding the RM100 threshold shall only be credited into the member’s or distributor’s eWallet upon request. The eWallet functionality allows the members to place new product orders utilizing eWallet available balance and/or request commission payout via multiple payment methods provided that each of the withdrawal amount exceeds RM100. Amounts held in eWallets are reflected on the balance sheet as a current liability.

18. CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS

 

(a) Major customers

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.

 

As of March 31, 2024, seven individual customers accounted for approximately 25.0% of the Company’s balance of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, six individual customers and one company accounted for approximately 40.2% of the Company’s balance of accounts receivable.

 

(b) Major vendors

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, three vendors accounted for approximately 64.2%, 18.2% and 12.6% of the Company’s total purchases. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, three vendors accounted for approximately 21.1%, 17.3% and 14.7% of the Company’s total purchases, respectively.

 

As of March 31, 2024, two vendors accounted for approximately 73.0% and 24.2% of the Company’s total balance of accounts payable, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, two vendors accounted for approximately 61.8% and 35.4% of the Company’s total balance of accounts payable, respectively.

 

CTA Nutriceuticals (Asia) Sdn Bhd, a related company, accounted for approximately 24.2% and 35.4% of the Company’s total balance of accounts payable as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

(c) Commission Expenses to Sales Distributors and Stockists

 

One sales distributor accounted for 19.7% of the Company’s commission expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024. One sales distributor accounted for 14.2% of the Company’s commission expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

(d) Credit risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, $3,564,550 and $4,817,213 were deposited with financial institutions, respectively, $3,371,627 and $4,630,476 of these balances were not covered by deposit insurance, respectively. While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness.

 

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration of credit risk in its account receivable is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. Historically, the Company did not have any bad debt on its account receivable.

 

(e) Exchange rate risk

 

The Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady; therefore, there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of RM and HK$ converted to US$ on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and economic environments without notice.

 

                                                                  F-32

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance for inventories obsolescence, impairment of long-lived assets and allowance for deferred tax assets. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates.

 

Estimated allowance for inventories obsolescence

 

Management reviews inventory on hand for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable items, as compared to future demand requirements and the shelf life of the various products. Based on the review, the Company records inventory write-downs, when necessary, when costs exceed expected net realizable value. The Company did not recognize any inventory write-downs nor inventory write-off for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Impairment of long-lived assets 

 

Operating right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. In determining whether an asset is impaired, the Company has to exercise judgment and make estimation, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event has occurred or any indicators that may affect the asset value; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable that is its carrying amount exceeds the amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows result from the use of the asset. Once it is established that impairment has occurred, the amount of impairment expense is determined as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the carrying amounts of operating right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment amounted to $314,390 and $63,080 (March 31, 2023: $41,593 and 160,480). No impairment losses on operating right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment were recognized as of March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

                                                                   7

 

 

Allowance for deferred tax assets

 

The Company conducts much of its business activities in Malaysia and Hong Kong and is subject to tax in each of these jurisdictions. Significant estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

 

Deferred tax assets relating to certain temporary differences and tax losses are recognized as management considers it is more likely than not that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences or tax losses can be utilized. Where the expectation is different from the original estimate, such differences will impact the recognition of deferred tax assets and taxation in the periods in which such estimate is changed.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Revenue recognition

 

On July 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606). The core principle underlying the revenue recognition of this ASU allows the Company to recognize - revenue that represents the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are recognized at a point in time for the Company’s sale of health and wellness products.

 

The ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.

 

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of substantially collection.

 

Sales of Health and Wellness products

 

- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time

 

The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when control of the health and wellness products are transferred to its customer at the Company’s office or shipment of the goods. The revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and return allowances. Products are given 60 days for returns or exchanges from the date of purchase. Historically, there were insignificant sales returns.

 

Under the Company’s network marketing business, the Company issues product coupons to members and distributors when these customers made purchases above certain thresholds set by the Company. Depending on the type of product coupons issued, the coupons carry varying values and can be used by the customers for reduction in the transaction price of product purchases within the coupon validity period. The value of the product coupons issued is recorded as a reduction of the Company’s revenue account upon issuance; the corresponding amount credited to the customer deposits account. Amounts in customer deposits will be reversed when the coupons are used. The Company’s coupons have a validity period of between six and twelve months. If the Company’s customers did not utilize the coupons after the validity period, the Company would recognize the forfeiture of the originated sales value of the coupons as net revenues.

 

                                                                   8

 

 

Provision of Health and Wellness services

 

- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time

 

The Company carries out its Wellness program, where the Company’s products are bundled with health screening test and a health camp program. The health screening test and the health camp programs are considered as separate performance obligations. The promises to deliver the health screening test report and the attendance at the health camp are separately identifiable, which are evidenced by the fact that the Company provides separate services of delivering the health screening test report and allowing admission of the customers to attend the health camp. The Company based on the health screening test contracts with customers, establishes the selling price for the health screening test and place order to the health screening center. The Company obtains control of the test report before they are delivered to the customers. The Company analyze the test report, provides consultations to the customers, bundle it with the Company’s products and services depending on the customer’s needs. The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the test reports are completed and delivered to its customers during the consultation section in person. The Company also separately derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the health camp program was completed in the final day of the health camp.

 

Fair value of financial instruments

 

The accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company.

 

The accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:

 

     ●    Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

           markets.

     ●    Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and

           inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of

           the financial

           instruments.

     ●    Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.

 

Financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest.

 

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2024

 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01 “Leases (Topic 842) Common Control Arrangements”. This ASU provides guidance in ASC Topic 842 that Leasehold improvements associated with common control leases should be (i) amortized by the lessee over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease, and (ii) accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if and when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The ASU 2023-01 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption of this accounting standard has no material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended and as at March 31, 2024.

 

The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months end and as at March 31, 2024.

 

Recent accounting pronouncements

 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (“ASUs”). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. The ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01 “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards”. The ASU clarify how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, by adding illustrative guidance. The guidance in ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and can be applied either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date at which the entity first applies the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 “Codification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements”. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

 

Except for the above-mentioned pronouncements, there are no other new recent issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Foreign exchange risk. Substantially most of our revenues are denominated in the Malaysian Ringgit while most of our expenses are denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments. Although in general, our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of an investment in our Common Stock may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Malaysian Ringgit; and U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar because the value of our business is effectively denominated in Malaysian Ringgit and Hong Kong Dollar, while the Common Stock is traded in U.S. dollars.

 

Credit risk. Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.

 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As of the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.

 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ●    Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of the assets of the

           company;

           

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures

           of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;

           and

           

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

           company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

                                                                   10

 

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

 

As of March 31, 2024, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s management, including our chief executive and chief financial officer, concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, internal controls and procedures over financial reporting were not effective. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

 

Identified Material Weakness

 

A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

 

Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024:

 

(i) insufficient full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily recording of transactions, address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii) lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the preventive internal control procedures and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that the Company’s policies and procedures have been carried out as planned.

 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.

 

                                                                   11

 

 

Management’s Remediation Initiatives

 

In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we will prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines, to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions.

 

To further strengthen the Company’s internal controls, we plan to initiate the following measures going forward:

 

1.   We intend to establish an internal audit function with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of

      overall internal

      control.

      

2.   Once we hire additional employees, we intend to initiate a comprehensive training program and development plan to provide ongoing

      company-wide trainings regarding internal control and requirements of U.S. GAAP financial statements and related disclosures,

      with particular emphasis on our accounting

      staff.

 

We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2024.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

 

Except as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   12
