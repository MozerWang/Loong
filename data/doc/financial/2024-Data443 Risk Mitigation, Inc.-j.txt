DATA443 RISK MITIGATION, INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Description of Business

 

Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on May 4, 1998. On October 15, 2019, the Company changed its name from LandStar, Inc. to Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. within the state of Nevada.

 

The Company delivers solutions and capabilities that businesses can use in conjunction with their use of established cloud vendors such as Microsoft® Azure, Google® Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon® Web Services (AWS), as well as with on-premises databases and database applications with virtualization platforms, such as those hosted or configured using VMWare®, Citrix® and Oracle® clouds/products).

 

Advance Payment for Acquisition

 

On January 19, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Centurion Holdings I, LLC (“Centurion”) to acquire the intellectual property rights and certain assets collectively known as Centurion SmartShield Home and SmartShield Enterprise, patented technology that protects and recovers devices in the event of ransomware attacks. The total purchase price of $3,400,000 consists of: (i) a $250,000 cash payment at closing; (ii) a $2,900,000 promissory note issued by Data443 in favor of Centurion (“Centurion Note”); and (iii) $250,000 in the form of a contingent payment. The Centurion Note matures January 19, 2027 but provides that Data443’s repayment obligation would accelerate on the occurrence of certain events. One of those events was a financing event that did not occur within the originally anticipated timeframe. If that event had occurred, then Data443’s repayment obligation would have been to repay the balance of the outstanding principal and interest as follows: (i) $500,000 of the then-outstanding amount due in cash; and (ii) the remaining balance, at Data443’s option, in Common stock or a combination of Common stock and cash, with the number of shares of Common stock to be determined according to a specified formula. In April 2022, Data443 and Centurion agreed that, even though the trigger for this acceleration event did not occur, Data443 would issue shares of Common stock to Centurion in an amount then-equivalent to $2,400,000, as partial repayment of the obligation due under the Centurion Note. The number of shares of Common stock Data443 issued to Centurion on April 20, 2022, was 380,952. Because Data443 still has some repayment obligations to fulfill under the Centurion Note, as of the filing date of these financial statements, the acquisition that is the subject of the Centurion Asset Purchase Agreement is still not completed, and is expected to be completed in 2024.

 

Reverse Stock Splits

 

Effective September 20, 2023 and March 7, 2022, we effected an 600 for 1 and 8 for 1 reverse stock split, respectively, of our issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock Splits”). All references to shares of our common stock in this annual report refers to the number of shares of common stock after giving retrospective effect to these Reverse Stock Splits (unless otherwise indicated).

 

Basis of Presentation

 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, we have included all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto and other pertinent information contained in our Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Basis of Consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Data 443 Risk Mitigation, Inc., a North Carolina operating company. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with US GAAP. All inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

                                                                   6                                                                    

 

 

Reclassifications

 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings (loss) or and financial position.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Trade receivables are generally recorded at the invoice amount mostly for a one-year period, net of an allowance for credit loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, we recorded bad debt expense of $0 and $0, respectively

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

Employees – We account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to employees, including the grant of employee stock options, to be calculated based on its fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date), and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.

 

Nonemployees - Under the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Stock-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”), we account for stock-based compensation to non-employees under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to be calculated based on the fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date), and recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.

 

We recorded approximately $189,141 in stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 113,854 in stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions requires judgment. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the fair value of each option grant was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility represents the historical volatility of our publicly traded common stock. Due to limited historical data, we calculate the expected life based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual term which is in accordance with the simplified method. The expected term for options granted to nonemployees is the contractual life. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options. We have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of Common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.

 

Contingencies 

 

We account for contingent liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450, Contingencies. This standard requires management to assess potential contingent liabilities that may exist as of the date of the financial statements to determine the probability and amount of loss that may have occurred, which inherently involves an exercise of judgment. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed in our financial statements. For loss contingencies considered remote, we generally would neither accrue any estimated liability nor disclose the nature of the contingent liability in our financial statements. Management has assessed potential contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2024, and based on that assessment, there are no probable or possible loss contingencies requiring accrual or establishment of a reserve.

 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share

 

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and as if converted method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, warrant and convertible notes.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, ASC Subtopic 326 “Credit Losses”: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. Since the issuance of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the Board has provided resources to monitor and assist stakeholders with the implementation of Topic 326. Post-Implementation Review (PIR) activities have included forming a Credit Losses Transition Resource Group, conducting outreach with stakeholders of all types, developing educational materials and staff question-and-answer guidance, conducting educational workshops, and performing an archival review of financial reports. ASU No. 2022-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 2: LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, we have incurred significant current period losses and we have negative working capital and an accumulated deficit. We have relied upon loans and issuances of our equity to fund our operations. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters, include raising additional debt or equity financing, the terms of which might not be acceptable. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 7: LEASES

 

Operating lease

 

We have two noncancelable operating leases for office facilities, one that we entered into January 2019 and that expires January 10, 2024 and another that we entered into in April 2022 and that expires April 30, 2024. We have signed an amendment for the lease at our current office through the end of 2024. with a one year renewal option and a rent escalation clause. In the summer of 2022, we relocated to the expanded square footage of the premises that are the subject of the April 2022 lease to support our growing operations, and entered into a commission agreement with the landlord of the building to sublet the premises that are the subject of the January 2019 lease.

 

We recognized total lease expense of approximately $81,656 and $76,386 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to operating lease costs paid to lessors from operating cash flows. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded a security deposit of $29,467.

Slate Advance Agreement

 

In March 2023 we entered into an agreement (the “Slate Agreement”) with Slate  Advance (“Slate”) pursuant to which we sold $1,482,000 in future receivables (the “Slated Receivables Purchased Amount”) to Slate in exchange for payment to the Company of $975,000 in cash less fees of $40,325. The Company agreed to pay Slate at maximum of $14,999 each day until the Slate Receivables Purchased Amount is paid in full. The term of the Slate Agreement is indefinite.  There is no stated interest rate. We recorded the difference between the purchase price and the receivable purchase as a debt discount.  The debt discount balance is amortized as payments are made and recorded as interest expense.

 

In order to secure payment and performance of the Company’s obligations to Slate under the Slate Agreement, the Company granted to Slate a security interest in the following collateral: all accounts receivable and all proceeds as such term is defined by Article 9 of the UCC. We also agreed not to create, incur, assume, or permit to exist, directly or indirectly, any lien on or with respect to any of such collateral.

 

We analyzed the transaction under the guidance of ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring to determine if the transaction qualified as a troubled debt restructuring. For a debt restructuring to be considered troubled, the debtor must be experiencing financial difficulty, and the creditor must have granted a concession. We analyzed the Slate Transaction under ASC 470-60 and determined that we met one of the definitions of a company experiencing financial difficulty, such as currently in default of any of our debts. As we are not in default, the fair value of the debt has not changed, we did not recognize gain or loss as the fair value has not changed, and the future undiscounted cash flows are not greater or smaller than the carrying value, the creditor has not granted any concessions. We believe that the debt does not fall into the troubled debt restructuring guidance since no concessions were granted by the creditor.

 

Effective June 1, 2023, the Company exchanged its convertible promissory note originally issued on December 21, 2021 in the amount of $555,555 in favor of Westland Properties, LLC for the issuance of a new promissory note issued in favor of Westland Properties, LLC in the amount of $665,000 (the “Exchange Note”). The original convertible Note was cancelled as a result of the exchange and the issuance of the Exchange Note. Terms of the Exchange Note include, without limitation, the following:

 

     a.   Principal balance of $665,000, interest rate of 3%, default interest rate of 18%;

           

     b.   $115,000 on or prior to July 25, 2023;

           

     c.   A series of nine (9) monthly payments to the Holder in the amount of $38,889 with the first payment beginning September 1,

           2023 with the final payment to be adjusted for any interest;

           and

           

     d.   $200,000 on the earlier of (i) three (3) business days following the Company’s successful listing (“Uplisting”) on any of

           the NYSE American, the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the New York

           Stock Exchange or (ii) the receipt of not less than $4,000,000 in funding from a single transaction (in either event an

           “Uplist

           Payment”)

           

     e.   Maturity date of September 30, 2021. Notes were fully converted in February 2021

 

In addition to exchanging the original Note, Westland Properties, LLC forgave $4,724,299 in default accrued interest and interest of $179,782.

 

                                                                   15

 

 

NOTE 10: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Employment Related Claims

 

We view most legal proceedings involving claims of former employees as routine litigation incidental to the business, and therefore not material.

 

Litigation

 

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to our business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employees, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. However, an unforeseen unfavorable development in any of these cases could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded.

 

NOTE 11: CAPITAL STOCK AND REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

 

Changes in Authorized Shares

 

On September 20, 2023, we filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-600 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, each with $0.001 par value (‘Common Stock’). All per share amounts and number of shares, in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, -0- and -0- shares of Series B were issued and outstanding, respectively.

Through his ownership of Series A Preferred Shares, Mr. Remillard has voting control over all matters to be submitted to a vote of our shareholders.

ITEM 2.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the “Quarterly Report”).

 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements.” All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “continues,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “would” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. They appear in a number of places throughout this Quarterly Report, and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, future acquisitions, and the industry in which we operate.

 

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Annual Report, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

     ●    we will need additional capital to fund our operations;

           

     ●    there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;

           

     ●    we will face intense competition in our market, and we may lack sufficient financial and other resources to maintain and

           improve our competitive

           position;

           

     ●    we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jason Remillard;

           

     ●    our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink and is thinly traded, reducing your ability to liquidate your

           investment in

           us;

           

     ●    we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses, which may prevent us from attaining profitability;

           

     ●    the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating

           performance;

           

     ●    we have shares of preferred stock that have special rights that could limit our ability to undertake corporate transactions,

           inhibit potential changes of control, and reduce the proceeds available to our common stockholders in the event of a change

           in

           control;

           

     ●    we have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends;

           

     ●    our Chief Executive Officer has the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which limits our

           stockholders’ ability to influence corporate affairs;

           and

           

     ●    the other factors described in “Risk Factors.”

 

Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this quarterly report.

 

                                                                   19

 

 

Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments may differ materially from statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report. The matters summarized under “Overview”, “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Business” and elsewhere in this quarterly report could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

 

In light of these risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this quarterly report speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments, except as required by applicable law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

Our customers include established leaders and up-and-coming businesses spanning the private and public/government sectors across diverse industries and fields, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology, and telecommunications.

 

The mounting ransomware landscape and other threats to data have accelerated the rate at which businesses are adopting data security solutions and we believe that our portfolio of data security and privacy products provides a comprehensive solution set that we believe positions us to capitalize on that increased adoption rate and to establish our products as new data privacy and security standards. Our offerings are anchored in reliable and comprehensive privacy management and equip organizations with a seamless approach to safeguard data, protect against attacks, and otherwise mitigate the most critical risks.

 

Sector-specific US laws, state-level legislation, and outside-the-United States (OUS) regulations are confounding enterprises of all sizes for whom safeguarding and stewarding data is key, but for whom becoming specialists in privacy and security is not an element of their strategic roadmap. For many of these enterprises, we can bridge the gap between their need to protect data and their need to use their resources to grow their core business by offering turnkey solutions and related counseling and technical support to offset risks from data breaches and security incidents of various types. We provide products and services for the marketplace that are designed to protect data that is stored in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid cloud/on-premises environments, and data that is transmitted throughout the enterprise, including but not limited to by remote employees. Our suite of security products focuses on protecting sensitive files and email, confidential customer, patient and employee data, financial records, strategic and product plans, intellectual property and other proprietary information, allowing our customers to create, share, and protect their sensitive data wherever it is stored and however it is used.

 

We deliver solutions and capabilities that businesses can use in conjunction with their use of established cloud vendors such as Microsoft® Azure, Google® Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon® Web Services (AWS), as well as with on-premises databases and database applications and with virtualization platforms, such as those hosted or configured using VMWare®, Citrix®, and Oracle® products.

 

We sell or plan to sell substantially all of our products and services through a sales model that combines the leverage of a channel sales model or direct account management, thereby providing us with opportunities to grow our current customer base and deliver our value proposition for data privacy and security. We endeavor to use subscription models to license products and services, commonly for a paid in-advance, multiyear term that is auto-renewing. We also make use of channel partners, distributors, and resellers which sell to end-users of the products and services. This approach allows us to maintain close relationships with our customers and benefit from the global reach of our partners. Additionally, we are enhancing our product offerings and go-to-market strategy by establishing technology alliances within the IT infrastructure and security vendor ecosystem. Our sales and marketing focus for new organic growth is on organizations with 500 or more users who are adopting cloud services and can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value.

 

We continue to onboard to cloud-native technology adoption portals such as the Microsoft® Azure Marketplace and the Amazon® AWS Marketplace. Vendors may offer incentives to us as a software and services provider to onboard and market via their marketplace portals.

 

                                                                   20

 

 

We strive to create new and innovative products and to improve existing products, proactively identifying and solving the data security needs of our customers.

 

As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, data privacy requirements get more complex, and data security becomes more challenging, we believe we are well positioned to capture more market share, continue to lead in strategic data security technology development, and prepare organizations for the next epoch in IT data privacy services.

Outlook

 

Our objective is to further integrate our suite of data security, ransomware protection, and privacy products and offer the products alone or in combination to enterprise customers directly and via our partner channels. We aim to position our products to meet the challenges our customers face - data privacy concerns grow in lockstep with security breaches, the need to continually expand data storage, and to meet telework, telehealth, and remote learning requirements.

 

We have relied on and expect to continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions of products, talent, and an established customer base to contribute to our long-term growth objectives.

 

Key elements of our growth strategy may be summarized as follows:

 

Acquisitions. We intend to aggressively pursue acquisitions of other cybersecurity software and service providers focused on the data security sector. We target companies with a developed and/or steady client base, as well as companies with offerings that complement our existing suite of products.

 

Research & Development; Innovation. We intend to increase our spending on research and development to create new and innovative products and to improve existing products, proactively identifying and solving the data security needs of our clients.

 

Grow Our Customer Base. We believe the continued challenges businesses face in managing their enterprise data and the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats will keep the demand high for the type of products and services we offer. We intend to capitalize on this demand by continually developing and curating a collection of products and services that are attractive and relevant to both our established revenue base and to new customers.

 

Expand Our Sales Capacity. We believe that continuing to expand our sales force will be essential to achieving our expansion and growth. We intend to expand our sales capacity by adding sales and marketing employees, with heavy focus on customer success and leveraging our existing customer relationships.

 

                                                                   22

 

 

Management’s Plans

 

Our plan is to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions, and then expand selling across our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. During the next twelve months, we anticipate incurring costs related to (i) filing of Exchange Act reports; and (ii) operating our businesses. We will require additional operating capital to maintain and continue operations. We will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing, and there is no assurance we will be able to raise the necessary capital.

 

While we primarily report income based on recognized and deferred revenue, another measurement internally for the business is booked revenues. Management uses this measure to track numerous indicators such as: contract value growth; initial contract value per customer; and certain other values that change quarter-over-quarter. These results may also be subject to, and impacted by, sales compensation plans, internal performance objectives, and other activities. We continue to increase revenue from our existing operations. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year at a time. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we executed during previous periods. Consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. Any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.

 

Recent Developments

 

Acquisition of Certain Assets of Cyren Ltd.

 

On May 15, 2023 we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets (the “Cyren Assets”) of Cyren Ltd. (“Cyren”) a company that provided emerging and high-volume risk mitigation services for some of the world’s largest name brand organizations prior to its bankruptcy filing in February 2023. Pursuant to a purchase agreement, the appointed receiver for the Cyren Assets (the “Receiver”) agreed to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to us, and we agreed to purchase from the Receiver, all right, title, and interest in and to the Cyren Assets, as further described in the purchase agreement, as amended on December 12, 2023 (as so amended, the “Purchase Agreement”). On December 15, 2023 we closed the transaction.

 

Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we acquired goodwill, clients, proprietary technology and intellectual property related to three services: threat intelligence, URL categorization and email security. We believe the transaction enhances our existing product portfolio and accelerates the development of next-generation solutions. Cyren’s technology is based on a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning and big-data analytics, which we believe enables Cyren to identify and mitigate threats in real time, sooner than many competitors.

 

Cyren’s clients include some of the world’s largest name brand organizations and provides fast-breaking threat detection services and threat intelligence to major firewall vendors, email providers, leading cybersecurity vendors, and other industries such as gaming and e-commerce.

 

We believe that the Cyren technology, services and customers strengthen our competitive position by broadening our product offerings and enhancing our technological capabilities.

Revenue

 

The increase in revenue is due to our acquisition of intellectual property from the Appointed Receiver for the Assets of Cyren Ltd. However, we continue to see organic growth in increased consumption of our services that contain storage or volume components, matching our expectations and as is reflected in our continuing Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR’) growth. We are offering and closing deals based on professional services consulting to further enable our technological capabilities within our existing customer base.

 

Cost of Revenue

 

Cost of revenue consists of direct expenses, such as labor, shipping, and supplies. The increase in cost of revenue is a result of the additional costs associated with our acquisition of intellectual property, specifically a large data center cost footprint, from the Appointed Receiver for the Assets of Cyren Ltd. Significant efforts are underway to reduce/minimize the operating footprint of the Cyren Assets.

 

Operating Expenses

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 our operating expenses were as follows:

General and Administrative Expenses

 

The general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of management costs, costs to integrate assets we acquired and to expand sales, product enhancements, audit and review fees, filing fees, professional fees, and other expenses related to SEC reporting, in connection with the projected growth of our business. Additionally, we continue to incur specific one-time costs in relation to our planned national exchange-based uplisting, additional financing activities and related functions. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees.

 

Sales and Marketing Expenses

 

The sales and marketing expenses primarily consisted of additional focus on cross-sell, upsell and growth in existing contracts from customers. As our retention activities of the assets of Cyren customer base has largely transitioned to increased consumption and quality of service delivery efforts. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to focused investments in marketing campaigns, supporting tools and direct client engagement efforts to form our product roadmaps and continue to deliver significant value to our clients.

The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was mainly derived from an operating loss of $262,159, interest expense of $475,734. The increase in Net Loss was primarily due to the increase in cost of revenue and an increase in interest expense.

 

                                                                   24

We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash balance of $5,063 and our principal sources of liquidity were trade accounts receivable of $164,201, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $48,335, as compared to cash of $84,570, trade accounts receivable of $309,768 and prepaid and other current assets of $29,467 as of December 31, 2023.

 

During the last two years, and through the date of this Report, we have faced an increasingly challenging liquidity situation that has limited our ability to execute our operating plan. We will need to obtain capital to continue operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure such funding on acceptable terms. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we reported a loss from operations of $560,313.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had assets of cash in the amount of $5,063 and other current assets in the amount of $212,536. As of March 31, 2024, we had current liabilities of $14,536,353. Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024 was $57,285,995.

 

As of December 31, 2023, we had assets of cash in the amount of $84,570 and other current assets in the amount of $339,235. As of December 31, 2023, we had current liabilities of $13,801,416. We accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023 was $55,656,836.

 

The revenues generated from our current operations will not be sufficient to fund our planned growth. We will require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business. Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Unless we can attract additional investment, our operating as a going concern is in doubt.

 

We are now obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time-consuming and costly. In order to meet the needs to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act, we will need investment of capital.

 

Management has determined that additional capital will be required in the form of equity or debt securities. There is no assurance that management will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

 

If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future obligations, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock.

We are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented.

 

Our critical estimates include revenue recognition and intangible assets. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

 

The critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows:

 

Convertible Financial Instruments

 

We bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable GAAP.

 

When we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.

 

                                                                   26

 

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. For non-employees, as per ASU No. 2018-7, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Stock-Based Payment Accounting, remeasurement is not required. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by us in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash. Also, refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report.

 

ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information regarding this Item.

 

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. However, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under Exchange Act) as of the end of the period reported on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that we have material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficient to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024.

 

Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. An evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation was based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

                                                                   27

 

 

Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that, as of March 31, 2024 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the identification of material weaknesses described as follows:

 

     ●    We did not have controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of

           accounting transactions. Accordingly, we believe we have a material weakness because there is a reasonable possibility that

           a material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a

           timely

           basis.

           

     ●    We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal

           controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us.

           Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our

           assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted

           represented a material

           weakness.

 

     ●    We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our

           size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.

           However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions

           should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties

           on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted

           represented a material

           weakness.

           

     ●    We do not have a functioning audit committee or outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective

           oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and

           procedures.

 

Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is committed to improving its internal controls when we have adequate resources to do so, we appointed a full-time Chief Financial Officer in September but do not currently have independent directors or an audit committee. Until there are independent directors and an audit committee, we will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties by (i) continuing to use third party specialists to assist us with accounting and finance; and (ii) commissioning frequent reconciliations of significant accounts using independent auditors.

 

Our Management has discussed the material weaknesses noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of these material weaknesses, it is reasonably possible that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected during our financial close and reporting process.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   28
