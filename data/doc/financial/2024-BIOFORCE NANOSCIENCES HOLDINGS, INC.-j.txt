NOTE 1 – Organization & Description of Business

 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 10, 1999, as Silver River Ventures, Inc.  On February 24, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of BioForce Nanosciences Holdings Inc. (“BioForce”), a Delaware corporation, and changed the corporate name at that time. On May 6, 2020, the Company purchased 100,000 shares of Element Acquisition Corporation for $1,000 which then became a wholly owned subsidiary. On October 15, 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary changed its name from Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation, to BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc, a Wyoming corporation. On December 14, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary changed its name from BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation to Element Global Inc., a Wyoming corporation. The Company’s mission is to become a leading provider of vitamin, mineral and other nutritional supplements, powders and beverages, formulated to promote a healthier lifestyle for active individuals in all age ranges.  

 

NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet has been derived from the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related footnotes included in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). It is management’s opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments), have been made which are necessary for fair condensed consolidated financial statements presentation. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bioforce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Element Global, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, (the “Company”).  All significant inter-company balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Earnings (Loss) per Share

 

Earnings (loss) per share of common stock are computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for each period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options, warrants and convertible securities, if dilutive. Common stock equivalents that are anti-dilutive are excluded from both diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding and diluted earnings (loss) per share.

 

                                                                  -7-                                                                   

 

 

BIOFORCE NANOSCIENCES HOLDINGS, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

 

NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

We account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value given their short-term nature or effective interest rates.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information provided for disclosures.

 

The Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold from product sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:  identify the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

 

NOTE 3 – Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements, including the new lease standard.  The Company does not have any leases and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

NOTE 4 – Going Concern

 

The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring losses from operations and has net current liabilities and an accumulated deficit.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

While the Company is attempting to continue operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations.  Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company’s business plan; to expand sales with a dynamic marketing campaign and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2023, due to lack of revenues the officers of the Company paid for all expenses through loans to the Company.  This allowed the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

                                                                  -8-

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1, above.

 

Forward Looking Statements

 

Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:

 

· our future strategic plans

· our future operating results;

· our business prospects;

· our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;

· the dependence of our future success on the general economy;

· our possible future financing; and

· the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.

 

From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Words or phrases “will likely result”, “are expected to”, “will continue”, “is anticipated”, “estimate”, “project or projected”, or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements”. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the above discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

 

The risks identified here are not all inclusive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the company’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.

 

The financial information set forth in the following discussion should be read with the financial statements of BioForce NanoSciences Holdings, Inc. included elsewhere herein.

 

Business

 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. (“BioForce or the “Company”) was previously in the business of manufacturing nano-particular measurement devices and molecular printers, but due to a lack of profitability, the subsidiary of the company that owned that technology filed for bankruptcy.  That subsidiary and related technology was later bought out of bankruptcy by an unrelated third party.  Subsequently, new management came into the Company to pursue a better business model and now the Company’s mission is to become a leading provider of natural vitamins, minerals and other nutritional supplements, powders and beverages, formulated to promote a healthier lifestyle for active individuals in all age ranges. The Company private labels products with key distributors and manufacturing providers.

 

BioForce entered into the supplement business in or about 2015. These supplements, powders and beverages offer vitamins and minerals to complement a healthy intake of protein and carbohydrates for active individuals and participants in sports.

 

BioForce is working on its business model and it is in the process of establishing a dynamic marketing campaign to achieve brand awareness of its product offerings to drive business growth through sales of nutrition supplements to retailers, sporting goods retailers, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and online. BioForce currently markets its products through social media and telemarketing. The Company plans to expand marketing efforts with a direct marketing and B2B (Business to Business) sales campaign, with the eventual expectation to expand throughout the entire United States.

 

                                                                  -10-                                                                  

 

 

The Company proactively seeks to expand its “BioForce Eclipse” nutritional powder for use into households throughout the U.S., and the Company will approach retail stores, including health food and sporting goods stores to create a vendor relationship. During this phase, the Company will continue to try to advance its social media platform with direct online and targeted advertisements to health conscience individuals.

 

Nutrition retailers, grocery stores, retail pharmacies, and online stores, like Amazon, will be important channels for the Company’s Eclipse product-lines. In The USA, there are thousands of direct outlets like grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, department stores, medical clinics, surgery clinics, universities, nursing homes, prisons, and other facilities which are all targets of potential sales of the vitamin and mineral supplemental products.

 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. sells the BioForce Eclipse powder multivitamin and mineral supplement without non-compete and non-disclosure agreements. The Company currently private labels the powder through a manufacturer located in Virginia. The Company has a Supplier Agreement with this manufacturer that gives the Company non-exclusion rights to market the product.  The distributor owns the rights to the formula for this product.  If the Company can source product in a more cost-effective way without diminished quality, the Company would evaluate such opportunities when presented.  Currently, the distributor who provides the private label powder provides “Consignment Terms,” which allows us to only pay for the product when it is sold.

 

The FDA has rules regarding the fitness for consumption of foods as well as vitamins and supplements sold to the public, and those laws apply to our product.  However, our product does not require pre-clearance like a drug in order to be sold into the marketplace.

 

The Company in May 2020, formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation,with unlimited common shares authorized, par value $0.001. Element Acquisition Corporation was formed to pursue potential acquisitions in the media, entertainment, media technology and sports sectors.

 

The Company on October 15, 2020 changed the name of its wholly-owned subsidiary Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation, to BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation. Management intends to redomicile BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, into a Wyoming corporation using its wholly-owned BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation as the entity for the redomicile corporate action.

 

On December 14, 2021, the Company changed the name of its wholly-owned subsidiary, BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, to its new name, Element Global, Inc.

 

Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)

 

June 02, 2021, Bioforce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. entered into another Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Element Global, Inc. (ELGL), a Utah Corporation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

 

Overall Operating Results:

 

Three Months – Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 - Unaudited Statements

 

The Sales Revenue from the Company’s BioForce Eclipse vitamin supplements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $-0- and $-0-, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company received no orders, -0- units of its Bioforce Eclipse supplement product.

 

The Cost of Goods Sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $-0- .

 

Gross Margins for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 0% from the sale of -0- units of the BioForce Eclipse supplement product.

 

Gross Profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $-0- .

 

Operating expenses for three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $130,813 from Board of Director compensation and General and Administrative Expenses, compared to $130,005 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase in March 31, 2024 compared to the same period ended March 31, 2023 was attributed to higher expenses from General and Administrative Expenses.

 

                                                                  -12-                                                                  

 

 

Net Loss:

 

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $130,813 and $130,004, respectively.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s assets totaled $640, which consisted of Cash. Our total liabilities were $1,950,683 from accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued director compensation expenses and amounts due to related parties. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $160,760,542 and working capital deficit $1,950,043.

 

As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan (See Note 4 in Financial Statements). For the next 12 months the Company has a written commitment from its CEO in Mr. Merle Ferguson’s employment contract to advance funds as necessary in meeting the Company’s operating requirements.

 

BioForce NanoSciences Holdings, Inc. does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries’ operating results, financial position, or cash flow.

 

Cash Provided by Used in Operating Activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $17,581 and $23,054, respectively. The decrease amount was attributed from higher amounts on accounts payable and accrued expenses.

 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

 

Net cash used in investing activities was $-0- for both the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $17,583 for three months ended March 31, 2024 from the proceeds from Related Parties, and was $23,006 for three months ended March 31, 2023 from proceeds from the proceeds from Related Parties.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

New Accounting Pronouncements

 

BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries’ operating results, financial position, or cash flow.

 

Accounting Principals

 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.

 

                                                                  -13-                                                                  

 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation.

 

We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

We were authorized to issue 900,000,000 shares of our common stock, of which 15,270,588 shares were outstanding taking into account the one-for-five (1-for-5) reverse stock split effective February 28, 2020. Our shares of common stock are held by approximately 235 stockholders of record.  The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of our common stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.  In addition to our authorized common stock, BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value at $0.001 per share. Based on the amended Articles of Incorporation the Company has 10,000,000 Series ‘A’ Preferred which have voting and conversion rights of 100 common shares, par value $0.001; leaving a balance of 90,000,000 “Blank Check” Preferred. There are no Series ‘A’ Preferred shares issued or outstanding.

 

Going Concern

 

We have incurred net losses since our inception. We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing growth in revenue and we will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our independent auditors’ report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.

Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 

Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

                                                                  -14-                                                                  

 

 

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

Management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

 

We identified the following deficiencies which together constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024:

 

            -The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design.

              

            -During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process,

              including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for the

              preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times by the

              same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a

              failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and

              related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our

              interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or

              detected.

 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

This report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

 

We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting to ensure that we maintain an effective internal control environment. If deficiencies appear in our internal controls, management will make changes that address those deficiencies.

 

                                                                  -15-                                                                  

 

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the reporting period ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
