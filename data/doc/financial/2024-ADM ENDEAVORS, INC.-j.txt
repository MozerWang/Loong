ADM ENDEAVORS, INC. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

March 31, 2024

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

On January 4, 2001, we were incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed its name to ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” “ADM,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”), a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. ADM then provided installation services to grocery décor and design companies primarily in North Dakota.

 

On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“JRP”), a Texas corporation. JRP was incorporated on January 17, 2010. The acquisition of 100% of JRP from its sole shareholder, Marc Johnson, was through a stock exchange whereby the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted Series A preferred stock (the “Acquisition Shares”) to Mr. Johnson in consideration of the acquisition of 100% of JRP from Mr. Johnson. Each share of the Series A preferred stock is convertible into ten shares of common stock, and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The Acquisition Shares represented 61% of the voting shares of the Company, and thus there was a change of voting control in connection with the transaction, and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition.

 

On April 27, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Innovative Impressions, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Company acquired (the “Acquisition”) embroidery equipment, inventory, and related assets from the Seller.

 

JRP is focused on being an added value reseller with concentration in embroidery, screen printing, importing and uniforms for businesses, schools and individuals in the State of Texas.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The Company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and has a year-end of December 31.

 

Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented.

 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023, was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 16, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.

 

                                                                   8



 

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, JRP, at March 31, 2024. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are related to allowance for credit losses, inventory obsolescence, goodwill, derivative liability, stock-based compensation and deferred tax valuations.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for stock and stock options awarded in return for services rendered. The expense is measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest.

 

Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of nine months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents. Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The amount in excess of the FDIC insurance at March 31, 2024 was $0. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.

 

Allowance for Credit Losses

 

The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to ensure trade and notes receivable are not overstated due to non-collectability. The Company’s allowance is based on a variety of factors, including age of the receivable, significant one-time events, historical experience, and other risk considerations. The Company had no allowance as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted-average cost method. The Company decreases the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value, based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company has inventory of $212,830 and $171,233 as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Two vendors accounted for approximately 92% of inventory purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Three vendors accounted for approximately 87% of inventory purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Derivative Instruments

 

Derivatives are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Changes in fair value are recorded in Other Income (Expense) of the consolidated statements of operations.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term loans, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

 

We follow accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

 

          Level 1:  Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

                     

          Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices

                     for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or

                     liabilities in markets that are not

                     active.

                     

          Level 3:  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions

                     developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would

                     use.

 

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 820 (the Fair Value Topic) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

 

The Company had no assets or liabilities other than derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 

Fixed Assets

 

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life. Upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill

 

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead assessed for impairment. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. No impairment was recorded in fiscal 2023 or 2022 as a result of our qualitative assessments over our single reporting segment.

 

The Company performs a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units to determine if the two-step process for impairment testing is required. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would then evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. In the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as impairment.

 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 

The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company’s long-lived assets, such as intellectual property, are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

 

The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.

 

The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

We recognize revenue for merchandise sales, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time of in-store purchase or delivery of the product to our customer. When merchandise is shipped to our guests, we estimate receipt based on historical experience. Revenue is deferred and a liability is established for sales returns based on historical return rates and sales for the return period. We recognize an asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for our right to recover returned merchandise. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities and return assets. For merchandise sold in our stores and online, tender is accepted at the point of sale. When we receive payment before the guest has taken possession of the merchandise, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the transaction is complete. Our performance obligations for unfulfilled merchandise orders are typically satisfied within one week. Shipping and handling fees charged to guests relate to fulfilment activities and are included in net sales with the corresponding costs recorded in cost of sales.

 

Cost of Sales

 

Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network and online fulfilment centers.

 

                                                                   11



 

 

Net Income per Share

 

The Company computes basic and diluted income per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity.

 

The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible securities and preferred stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, 4,969,180 and 6,732,011 shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible note, respectively, and 20,000,000 shares issuable upon the conversion of preferred shares, were considered for their dilutive effects but were determined to be anti-dilutive.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards and their respective tax bases.

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income (loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

 

The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 

Tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return. The Company has no liability for uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized as interest expense. The Company does not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any significant interest expense recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Segment Information

 

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 280-10, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company has one operating segment as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 

Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that no other pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.

NOTE 5 – CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE

 

Convertible Note Payable

 

On April 1, 2018, the Company assumed a convertible promissory note in connection with the reverse acquisition. The Company received total funding of $106,092 as of December 31, 2018. The note had fees of $53,046 which were recorded as a discount to the convertible promissory note and are being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. The maturity of the note is March 5, 2023. On March 5, 2023, the note was extended to September 5, 2023. On March 5, 2024, the note was extended to January 1, 2025.

 

The note is convertible into common stock at a price of 35% of the lowest three trading prices during the ten days prior to conversion. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the convertible debt was convertible into 4,969,180 and 9,290,560 common shares, respectively.

 

The note balance was $106,092 as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 

Derivative liabilities

 

The conversion features embedded in the convertible notes were evaluated to determine if such conversion feature should be bifurcated from its host instrument and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. In the convertible notes with variable conversion terms, the conversion feature was accounted for as a derivative liability. The derivatives associated with the term convertible notes were recognized as a discount to the debt instrument and the discount is amortized over the expected life of the notes with any excess of the derivative value over the note payable value recognized as additional interest expense at the issuance date.

 

                                                                   13

NOTE 10 – LEASE LIABILITY

 

Operating Leases

 

The Company leases office space. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases in our consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For leases beginning in 2018 and later, the Company accounts for lease components separately from the non-lease components. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of the lease renewal options is at the sole discretion of the Company. The depreciable life of the assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.

 

The Company leases approximately 18,000 square feet of space in Haltom City, Texas, pursuant to a month-to-month lease. This facility serves as our corporate headquarters, manufacturing facility and showroom. The lease is with M & M Real Estate, Inc. (“M & M”), a company owned solely by our majority shareholder and director of the Company.

 

On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease that expires June 30, 2024. The operating lease results in the recognition of ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet. ROU asset and operating lease liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease terms of the commencement date. Because the leases do not provide an explicit or implicit rate of return, the Company determines incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments on an individual lease basis. The incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments for the asset under similar terms, which is 5.50%. The Company’s lease does not contain any material restrictive covenants. The lease has a remaining term of 0.25 years.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION

 

SPECIAL NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our security holders and to the public. This report, therefore, contains statements about future events and expectations which are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” You can expect to identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “seek” and other similar expressions. Any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the plans, objectives, expectations and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects will be achieved.

 

Important factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in the “Risk Factors” section of and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

 

Company Overview

 

On January 4, 2001, ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” “ADM,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in North Dakota as “ADM Enterprises, Inc.” On May 9, 2006, the Company changed its name to “ADM Endeavors, Inc.” and its domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”) in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. ADM then provided installation services to grocery décor and design companies primarily in North Dakota.

 

On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“Just Right Products”), a Texas corporation, from its sole shareholder, Marc Johnson, through a share exchange transaction whereby the Company acquired 100% of Just Right Products and issued 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) to the shareholder of Just Rights Products. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of Company common stock and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The preferred shares represented 61% of the Company’s voting shares and constituted a change of voting control of the Company, with the transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition. As a result of the transaction, Just Right Products became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

 

Since that time, the Company has exclusively focused on its Just Right Productions operations, which includes a diverse vertical integrated business consisting of a retail sales division, screen print promotions, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale sourcing, and uniforms.

 

On April 27, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Innovative Impressions, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “Seller” or “Innovative Impressions”), pursuant to which the Company acquired embroidery equipment, inventory, and related assets from the Seller, which was paid by the issuance by the Company of a $200,000 secured promissory note (with a fair value of $143,637) to the Seller’s principal.

 

                                                                   17



 

 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, and 2023

 

Revenues

 

Our revenue was $1,056,138 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $640,444 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, resulting in an increase of $415,694, or 65%. The increase in revenue is primarily due to increased sales from newly acquired government contracts.

 

Operating Expenses

 

Direct costs of revenues were $721,227 and $507,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, resulting in an increase of $214,027, or 42%. The increase in direct costs was a direct result of the increased sales from newly acquired government contracts and the acquisition of Innovative Impressions in April 2023. The gross margin increased from 21% during the three months ended March 31, 2023, to 32% during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

General and administrative expenses were $386,032 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $275,103 for the same period in 2023. The increase in 2024 general and administrative expenses of approximately 40% was primarily due to additional expenses related to the second quarter 2023 acquisition from Innovative Impressions and the additional resources needed to service newly acquired government contracts.

 

Marketing and selling expenses were $8,042 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $12,454 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 marketing and selling expenses of approximately 35% decreased traditional marketing methods needed to acquire new government contracts. 

 

Net loss was $64,136 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $110,597 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for the reasons stated above.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023

 

We had cash provided by operations of $39,991 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash provided by operations of $166,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in positive cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to a change in net loss and inventory.

 

We had cash used in investing activities of $135,544 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $131,414 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The change in cash flow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was attributable to an increase in the purchase of property and equipment in 2024.

 

We had cash used in financing activities of $27,894 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $50,566 for the same period in 2023. Cash used in financing activities consisted of repayments on notes payable.

 

We will likely have to raise funds to pay for growth and acquisitions. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.

 

                                                                   18

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

The Company does not currently maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission’s rules and forms.

 

Disclosure controls and procedures would include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024, have been evaluated, and, based upon this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer has concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and procedures and the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. There were no changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Our property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings.
