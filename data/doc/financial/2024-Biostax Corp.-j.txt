CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are considered forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning our business, results of operations, economic performance and/or financial condition, based on management’s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions, and projections. Forward-looking statements are included, for example, in the discussions about:

 

     ●    strategy;

           

     ●    new product discovery and development;

           

     ●    current or pending clinical trials;

           

     ●    our products’ ability to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile;

           

     ●    actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities;

           

     ●    product manufacturing, including our arrangements with third-party suppliers;

           

     ●    product introduction and sales;

           

     ●    royalties and contract revenues;

           

     ●    expenses and net income;

           

     ●    credit and foreign exchange risk management;

           

     ●    liquidity;

           

     ●    asset and liability risk management;

           

     ●    the outcome of litigation and other proceedings;

           

     ●    intellectual property rights and protections;

           

     ●    economic factors;

           

     ●    competition; and

           

     ●    legal risks.

 

Any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” “aims,” “plans,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “will continue,” “seeks,” “should,” “predict,” “potential,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “target,” “forecast,” “probable,” “possible” or the negative of such terms and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to change and may be affected by risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events, except as required by law, although we intend to continue to meet our ongoing disclosure obligations under the U.S. securities laws and other applicable laws.

 

                                                                   3



 

 

We caution you that a number of important factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place too much reliance on them. These factors include, among others, those described herein, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our other public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, and therefore the factors that are noted are not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may affect forward-looking statements. If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, our actual performance and future actions may be materially different from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. We can offer no assurance that our estimates or expectations will prove accurate or that we will be able to achieve our strategic and operational goals.

 

Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.

 

Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    our lack of operating history;

           

     ●    our current and future capital requirements and our ability to satisfy our capital needs;

           

     ●    our inability to keep up with industry competition;

           

     ●    interpretations of current laws and the passages of future laws;

           

     ●    acceptance of our business model by investors and our ability to raise capital;

           

     ●    our drug discovery and development activities may not result in products that are approved by the applicable regulatory

           authorities and even if our drug candidates do obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or

           commercial

           success;

           

     ●    our reliance on key personnel and collaborative partners, including our ability to attract and retain scientists;

           

     ●    our reliance on third-party manufacturing to supply drugs for clinical trials and sales;

           

     ●    our limited distribution organization with no sales and marketing staff;

           

     ●    our being subject to product liability claims;

           

     ●    legislation or regulation that may increase the cost of our business or limit our service and product offerings;

           

     ●    risks related to our intellectual property, including our ability to adequately protect intellectual property rights;

           

     ●    risks related to government regulation, including our ability to obtain approvals for the commercialization of some or all

           of our drug candidates, and ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review which may result in significant

           additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;

           and

           

     ●    our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to allow us to market our products internationally.

 

Moreover, new risks regularly emerge, and it is not possible for our management to predict or articulate all risks we face, nor can we assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are based on information available to us on the date of this Quarterly Report. Except to the extent required by applicable laws or rules, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained above and throughout this Quarterly Report.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

1. Company Overview

 

Biostax Corp. (the “Company” or “BTAX”) is a Florida corporation trading on the OTC-Pink. The Company is a drug development and commercialization company. We identify, evaluate, and seek to acquire technologies in the medical device and drug development sectors with the intent to further develop them and move them to commercialization. On February 28, 2023, we received a written consent from a majority of our outstanding shareholders to change the name of our Company to “Biostax Corp.” On March 27, 2023, we filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C and mailed the information statement to shareholders on record as of the date of the filing. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 5, 2023 and our new Company name and trading symbol (BTAX) became effective on October 20, 2023.

 

Going Concern

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $2,098 in cash on hand, negative working capital of $4,864,722 and accumulated stockholders’ deficit of $385,668,216. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $337,076. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $416,117.

 

Historically the Company has relied on the funding of operations through private equity financing and management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue at more significant levels in the future. As the Company continues to incur losses, transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of its current or future product candidates as they become available and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional cash. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources.

 

Working capital at March 31, 2024 is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through the next twelve months without additional sources of cash. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

Management is continuing to develop strategies to re-capitalize the Company and position it for future growth. Key steps to this process include:

 

     ●    Improve the condition of the balance sheet via license arrangements and capital infusions.

     ●    Identify and acquire late-stage assets for commercialization.

     ●    Build out operational infrastructure to generate revenue opportunities to grow shareholder value.

 

There can be no guaranties that the Company will be successful in securing adequate capital to continue operations and in identifying and acquiring assets for future development.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

If the Company is unable to secure new working capital, other alternatives strategies will be required.

 

Historically, the Company’s strategy has been to acquire and develop assets; potentially spin them out and retain both an equity stake and royalties and milestone payments. In so doing, the Company would act as an incubator for late-stage drug development. Management believes that this strategy can be successful. At this time, the Company is reviewing several opportunities which it may pursue as soon as funding is available. At present, no definitive action has been taken.

 

There can be no guarantees that the Company will be successful in:

 

     ●    Executing its restructuring plan;

     ●    Securing adequate capital to continue operations; or

     ●    Identifying and acquiring assets for future development. 

 

Company History

 

The Company was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993, as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”). On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. On February 28, 2023, we received a written consent from a majority of our outstanding shareholders to change the name of our Company to “Biostax Corp.” On March 27, 2023, we filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C and mailed the information statement to shareholders on record as of the date of the filing. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 5, 2023 and our new Company name and trading symbol (BTAX) became effective on October 20, 2023

 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been omitted. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise indicated) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for the periods presented have been made. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of trends or of results to be expected for the full year. These condensed, consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the notes thereto) set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10- K/A for that period.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the Company’s condensed, consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed, consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

 

                                                                   11



 

 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include bank demand deposits, marketable securities with maturities of three months or less at purchase, and money market funds that invest primarily in certificates of deposits, commercial paper and U.S. government and U.S. government agency obligations. Cash equivalents are reported at fair value. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,098 and $29,785, respectively.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents. The Company is exposed to credit risk, subject to federal deposit insurance, in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of amounts recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cash accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000.

 

Segment and Geographic Information

 

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment and does not segment the business for internal reporting or decision making.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

In accordance with the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”, the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments.

 

Cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable are accounted for at cost which approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of notes payable approximate fair value since they bear market rates of interest and other terms. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.

 

Research and Development Costs

 

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and are typically comprised of expenses associated with advancing the commercialization of our technologies. The Company incurred $11,077 of research and development costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which solely represents interest and late fees related to the Company’s license agreement with TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals. The Company inclurred $180,924 of research and development costs during the three months ended March 31, 2023 which includes legal fees related to the maintenance and prosecution of licensed and owned intellectual property as well as the fair value of common stock issued to extend the payment terms of the Company’s license agreement with TaiwanJ Pharmaceuticals.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company follows ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

 

                                                                   12



 

 

The standard addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC Topic 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

 

At the date of adoption, and as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company does not have a liability for unrecognized tax uncertainties. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. As of March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company does not have any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

 

Stock-Based Compensation and Issuance of Common Stock for Non-Cash Consideration

 

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on estimated fair values equaling either the market value of the shares issued, or the value of consideration received, whichever is more readily determinable. Generally, the non-cash consideration pertains to services rendered by consultants and others and has been valued at the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of the agreement.

 

The Company’s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation.” The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor’s performance is complete.

 

The Company did not issue any stock-based compensation awards during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Net Income (Loss) per Share

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, basic and diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents.

 

                                                                   13



 

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, diluted income per share was calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. A reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding used in basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

The Company has reviewed the accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB during the first quarter of 2024. Applicable pronouncements will be adopted by the Company in accordance with the accounting guidance and definition. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

5. Income Taxes – Results of Operations

 

There was no income tax expense reflected in the results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 because the Company has significant net loss operating carryforwards available to offset the potential tax liabilities. Our tax rate can be affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions. It may also be affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.

 

For U.S. federal purposes the corporate statutory income tax rate was 21%, for 2024 and 2023 tax years. The Company has recognized no tax benefit for the losses generated for the periods through March 31, 2024.

 

ASC Topic 740 requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company’s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income. Because the Company has yet to recognize revenue, we believe that the full valuation allowance should be provided.

 

6. Subsequent Events

 

Management of the Company has performed a review of events and transactions occurring after the condensed consolidated balance sheet date to determine if there were any such events or transactions requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and has noted none.

 

                                                                   15

COMPANY OVERVIEW

 

Biostax Corp. is a Florida corporation trading on the OTC-Pink. The Company is a drug development and commercialization company. We identify, evaluate, and seek to acquire technologies in the medical device and drug development sectors with the intent to further develop them and move them to commercialization.

 

Our strategy has been limited due to lack of capital. Management is seeking to secure new investment capital with which to continue to pursue the Company’s strategy. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in securing additional capital.

 

GOING CONCERN

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $2,098 in cash on hand, negative working capital of $4,864,722 and accumulated stockholders’ deficit of $385,668,216. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $337,076. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $416,117.

 

Historically the Company has relied on the funding of operations through private equity financing and management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue at more significant levels in the future. As the Company continues to incur losses, transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of its current or future product candidates as they become available and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional cash. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources.

 

                                                                   16



 

 

Working capital at March 31, 2023 is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through the next twelve months without additional sources of cash. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

Management is continuing to develop strategies to re-capitalize the Company and position it for future growth. Key steps to this process include:

 

     ●    Improve the condition of the balance sheet via license arrangements and capital infusions.

     ●    Identify and acquire late-stage assets for commercialization.

     ●    Build out operational infrastructure to generate revenue opportunities to grow shareholder value.

 

There can be no guaranties that the Company will be successful in securing adequate capital to continue operations and in identifying and acquiring assets for future development.

 

If the Company is unable to secure new working capital, other alternatives strategies will be required.

 

Historically, the Company has been able to acquire and develop assets, spin them out and retain both an equity stake and royalties and milestone payments. In so doing, the Company has acted as an incubator for late-stage drug development. Management believes that this strategy can continue to be successful. At this time, the Company is reviewing several opportunities which it may pursue as soon as funding is available. At present no definitive actions have been taken.

 

There can be no guarantees that the Company will be successful in:

 

     ●    Executing its restructuring plan

     ●    Securing adequate capital to continue operations.

     ●    Identifying and acquiring assets for future development.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

Overview

 

Liquidity is measured by our ability to secure enough cash to meet our contractual and operating needs as they arise. The Company does not anticipate generating sufficient cash flows from our operations to fund the next twelve months. We had cash on hand of $2,098 at March 31, 2024, compared to $29,785 at December 31, 2023.

 

                                                                   18



 

 

Summary of Cash Flows

 

                                                                                                  For the three months ended           

                                                                                                           March 31

                                                                                                 2024                   2023

Net cash used in operating activities was $53,839 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $265,498 for the corresponding period in 2023. The use of cash in these periods resulted primarily from our losses from operations, as adjusted for changes in our working capital accounts.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial conditions, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

 

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Company’s board of directors. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this section where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

In accordance with the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”, the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments.

 

Cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable are accounted for at cost which approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of notes payable approximate fair value since they bear market rates of interest and other terms. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.

 

                                                                   19



 

 

Research and Development Costs

 

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and are typically comprised of expenses associated with advancing the commercialization of our technologies.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company follows ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

 

Stock-Based Compensation and Issuance of Stock for Non-Cash Consideration

 

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on estimated fair values equaling either the market value of the shares issued, or the value of consideration received, whichever is more readily determinable. Generally, the non-cash consideration pertains to services rendered by consultants and others and has been valued at the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of the agreement.

 

The Company’s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation.” The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor’s performance is complete.

 

Recent Accounting Standards

 

The Company has reviewed the accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Applicable pronouncements will be adopted by the Company in accordance with the accounting guidance and definition. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

Management does not believe there are other significant accounting pronouncements which have had or will have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

                                                                   20



 

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not Applicable.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that, because of the weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

 

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. The reportable conditions and material weakness relate to a limited segregation of duties and lack of an audit committee. The limited segregation of duties within the Company and the lack of an audit committee are due to the small number of employees. Management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting.

 

Going forward, management anticipates that additional staff will be necessary to remediate these weaknesses, as well as other planned improvements. Additional staff will enable us to document and apply transactional and periodic controls procedures, permit a better review and approval process and improve quality of financial reporting. However, the potential addition of new staff is contingent on obtaining additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.

 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

Readers are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our control have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

                                                                   21
