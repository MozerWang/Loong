PART I

 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 

The Company

 

On January 4, 2001, ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in North Dakota as “ADM Enterprises, Inc.” On May 9, 2006, the Company changed its name to “ADM Endeavors, Inc.” and its domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”) in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. ADM then provided installation services to grocery décor and design companies primarily in North Dakota.

 

On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“Just Right Products”), a Texas corporation, from its sole shareholder, Marc Johnson, through a share exchange transaction whereby the Company acquired 100% of Just Right Products and issued 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) to the shareholder of Just Rights Products. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of Company common stock and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The preferred shares represented 61% of the Company’s voting shares and constituted a change of voting control of the Company, with the transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition. As a result of the transaction, Just Right Products became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

 

On January 1, 2020, the Company determined that it would discontinue its business operations in North Dakota, specifically, ADM Enterprises LLC (the “Disposed Company”). The Company transferred the Disposed Company to Ardell Mees in exchange for Mr. Mees’ assumption of the liabilities of the Disposed Company. As part of the transaction, Mr. Mees resigned from all positions with the Company and, in a private transaction, sold a significant portion of his ownership in the Company to Marc Johnson. The Company and Mr. Mees entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which Mr. Mees indemnified the Company for the liabilities of the Disposed Company.

 

Since that time, the Company has exclusively focused on its Just Right Productions operations.

 

Current Business Operations

 

Just Right Products

 

Since 2010, Just Right Products has operated a diverse vertical integrated business, which consists of a retail sales division, screen print promotions, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale sourcing, and uniforms. All of these divisions are promoted and supported by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) /Web in-house department.

 

The Retail Sales Division focuses on any product with a logo. It sells a very wide range of products from business cards to coffee cups. Its motto is “We sell anything with a logo.” Just Right Products’ salespeople excel at sales because they are selling the items people like to buy. Our sales consist of sales made by in-house hourly employees and commissioned-based employees. In-house accounts are more profitable for Just Right Products than commissioned sales. Based on profitability reasons, Just Right Products has focused its resources on SEO and Website to develop more in-house customers.

 

The Screen Printing Department utilizes its five screen printing machines to print garments and other fabric items. The department can produce over 8,000 units per day. There are two types of orders, as follows: 1) Retail – where printing is done on purchased products, and 2) Contract printing – performed on wholesale customer provided products. Retail sales printing is more profitable whereas contract printing is less profitable but is beneficial at maximizing production capacity. Just Right Products is currently operating at approximately 70% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.

 

The Embroidery equipment has 51 heads of embroidery capacity. It is the same type of production as screen printing, as stated above, in regard to retail and contract embroidery. The Embroidery Department is operating at approximately 40% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.

 

The Digital Department also operates in the same manner as Screen Printing and Embroidery and is operating at approximately 50% of capacity based on its current equipment with significant growth potential.

 

All production departments have more equipment exceeding the workload of the employees’ potential. This gives Just Right Products the ability for expansion in revenue with the hiring of additional employees, and/or having the luxury of having backup equipment eliminating down time and the ability to handle large jobs with the help of part-time employees. The additional equipment is also part of an expansion plan.

 

                                                                   4

 

 

The Import Department sources products for retail and wholesale customers. We shifted some import operations from China to Pakistan. We also have fluent Arabic, Spanish, and Hindi speakers. We are also looking at India as a possible source to replace China sourced products. The Import Division is a significant asset as it allows the Company to meet customers’ demands with flexible delivery times.

 

The Uniform Division sells uniforms to businesses, schools and municipalities. Our advantages over our competition are in-house production and international sourcing and the ability to process the seasonal demands of the uniform business. This division is able to draw labor from other departments during peak demands thereby reducing the labor expense traditionally required to facilitate this type of seasonal business.

 

The Company has selected DAC Construction of Red Oak, Texas, to build our new corporate headquarters. Danny Christensen and his team have already started the building process. Eyncon Engineering has completed drilling to conduct soil samples. The drilling consisted of four boring holes at 25 ft, and four at 20 ft and three at 6 ft. This drilling is needed to evaluate the soil and substructure before we can pour the foundation, parking and roads. Grading has been completed, and the Company is now waiting on permits to allow construction to begin. The planned facility will be 80,000 to 100,000 square feet. Funding has tentatively been secured from CapTex bank.

 

Our company currently outsources signs and banners. We hope to acquire a sign shop allowing us to bring production in house and increase margins and customer base.

 

The new facility should allow us to add a fulfilment center that will enhance service to existing customers and attract larger customers that require fulfillment. We should also be able to enhance our current online retail store and have the ability to increase our inventory capacity for existing programs.

 

The Company believes the SEO/Web department is one of the keys to future growth. The Company has seen that customers tend to go online as their first source when our products are needed. Due to this trend, the Company is focusing approximately 80% of its advertising budget to maintain and grow the Company’s online presence.

 

The Company reports its businesses under the following SIC Code: 7319, Advertising-Promotional.

 

Competition

 

Just Right Products, Inc.

 

According to Promotional Products Association International (“PPAI”), in the past five years the United States promotional products industry expanded greatly, with annual revenues of over $23 billion and growth of over 3% per year, the industry employs over 250,000 people in over 26,000 businesses. Similar to other advertising industries over the period, the growing economy fostered healthy consumer spending, so businesses respond by increasing expenditures on advertisements to capture the attention of shoppers and downstream clients. In addition, an increase in the total number of US businesses added to the industry’s potential pool of clientele, as new companies often use promotional products to endorse their business, product or service. Over the next five years, we anticipate continued growth in corporate profit and total advertising expenditure will boost industry demand, compelling companies to spend more on promotional products.

 

Every single consumer for every single product is a potential recipient of branded promotional products. Countless thousands of promotional products have a far greater reaching impact than most people might think, considering the following facts: (source: PPAI)

 

●         83% of customers say they enjoy receiving a promotional product with an advertising message;

●         After receiving a promotional product, 85% of customers say they do business with the company;

●         58% of customers keep a promotional product for up to four years;

●         89% of customers can recall the advertiser on a promotional product they received in the past two years; and

●         A promotional product increases the effectiveness of other media by 44%.

 

                                                                   5

 

 

 

Compliance with Government Regulation

 

We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.

 

Environmental Regulations

 

We do not believe that we are or will become subject to any environmental laws or regulations of the United States. While our products and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our products or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 

Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings

 

There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding pertaining to the Company.

The Company and Mr. Mees entered into an indemnification agreement whereby Mr. Mees indemnified the Company for any liabilities of the Disposed Company.

Penny Stock

 

Our common stock is considered “penny stock” under the rules the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market System, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that:

 

●    contains a description of the nature and level of risks in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary

      trading;

 

                                                                   7

 

 

●    contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer

      with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities’ laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative

      description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid

      and ask

      price;

●    contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;

●    defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and

●    contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by

      rule or

      regulation.

 

The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with:

 

●    bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;

●    the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;

●    the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity

      of the marker for such stock;

      and

●    monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.

 

In addition, the penny stock rules that require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement.

 

These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

The Company currently has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include management’s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied, and the fair value of the common stock used in stock-based compensation and derivative valuations.

 

                                                                   10

 

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company measures their financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses escrow liability and short-term loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

 

We have adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company accounts for its revenue recognition under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.

 

In general, the Company applies the following steps when recognizing revenue from contracts with customers: (i) identify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

 

We recognize revenue for merchandise sales, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time of in-store purchase or delivery of the product to our guest. When merchandise is shipped to our guests, we estimate receipt based on historical experience. Revenue is deferred and a liability is established for sales returns based on historical return rates and sales for the return period. We recognize an asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for our right to recover returned merchandise. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities and return assets. For merchandise sold in our stores and online, tender is accepted at the point of sale. When we receive payment before the guest has taken possession of the merchandise, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the transaction is complete. Our performance obligations for unfulfilled merchandise orders are typically satisfied within one week. Shipping and handling fees charged to guests relate to fulfillment activities and are included in net sales with the corresponding costs recorded in cost of sales.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies.

 

Company management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

 

                                                                   11

 

 

We are susceptible to general economic conditions, natural catastrophic events and public health crises, and a potential downturn in advertising and marketing spending by advertisers could adversely affect our operating results in the near future.

 

Our business is subject to the impact of natural catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, or floods, public health crisis, such as disease outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, and all these could result in a decrease or sharp downturn of economies, including our markets and business locations in the current and future periods. The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in increased travel restrictions, and shutdown of businesses, which may cause slower recovery of the economy. We may experience impact from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to pandemic fears and impact on our workforce if the virus continues to spread. In addition, one or more of our customers, partners, service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress, delayed or defaults on payment, file for bankruptcy protection, sharp diminishing of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments and reactions throughout the world, which are highly uncertain and will include emerging information concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain the coronavirus. It is likely to result in a potential material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Wider-spread COVID-19 globally could prolong the deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term ability to grow our revenues. Any decreased collectability of accounts receivable, bankruptcy of small and medium businesses, or early termination of agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

Critical Audit Matters

 

Critical audit matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

ADM Endeavors, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2022

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”), a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises on July 1, 2008. ADM provides installation services to grocery décor and design companies primarily in North Dakota.

 

In May 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share.

 

On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“JRP”), a Texas corporation. JRP was incorporated on January 17, 2010. The acquisition of 100% of JRP from its sole shareholder was through a stock exchange whereas the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted Series A preferred stock (the “Acquisition Shares”). Each share of the Series A preferred stock is convertible into ten shares of common stock and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The Acquisition Shares represents 61% of voting shares, thus there is a change of voting control. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition.

 

JRP is focused on being an added value reseller with concentration in embroidery, screen printing, importing and uniforms for businesses, schools and individuals in the State of Texas.

 

On January 1, 2020, the Company determined that it would discontinue its business operations in North Dakota, specifically, ADM Enterprises (the “Disposed Company”). The Company made a settlement with Ardell Mees to provide him with the assets of the Disposed Company and in exchange, Mr. Mees assumed all liabilities of the Disposed Company. As part of the transaction, Mr. Mees resigned from all positions with the Company and, in a private transaction, sold a significant portion of his ownership in the Company to Marc Johnson. The Company and Mr. Mees entered into an indemnification agreement whereby Mr. Mees indemnified the Company for any liabilities of the Disposed Company.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary JRP, at December 31, 2022. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are related to allowance for doubtful accounts, derivative liability and deferred tax valuations.

 

                                                                   19

 

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for stock and stock options awarded in return for services rendered. The expense is measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest.

 

Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no cash equivalents.

 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and notes receivable are not overstated due to non-collectability. The Company’s allowance is based on a variety of factors, including age of the receivable, significant one-time events, historical experience, and other risk considerations. The Company had no allowance at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company had bad debt expense of $2,601 and $2,171 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted-average cost method. The Company decreases the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value, based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company has inventory of $168,082 and $139,111 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 

Four vendors accounted for approximately 73.6% and three vendors accounted for 71.5% of inventory purchases during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These same vendors made up 16% and %0 of our accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 

Derivative Instruments

 

Derivatives are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

 

                                                                   20

 

 

We follow accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.

 

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 820 (the “Fair Value Topic”) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

 

The Company had no assets or liabilities other than derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 

Fixed Assets 

 

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life. Upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in consolidated statements of operations.

 SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVE

Classification                                                        Estimated Useful Lives

Equipment                                                                  5 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements                                         Shorter of useful life or lease term

Furniture and fixtures                                                     4 to 7 years

Websites                                                                      3 years

 

Goodwill

 

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead assessed for impairment. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. No impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2021 or 2022 as a result of our qualitative assessments over our single reporting segment.

 

The Company performs a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units to determine if the two-step process for impairment testing is required. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would then evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. In the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as impairment.

 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 

The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB ASC for its long-lived assets. The Company’s long-lived assets, such as intellectual property, are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

 

                                                                   21

 

 

The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.

 

The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company accounts for its revenue recognition under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.

 

In general, the Company applies the following steps when recognizing revenue from contracts with customers: (i) identify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

 

We recognize revenue for merchandise sales, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time of in-store purchase or delivery of the product to our guest, which is our only performance obligation. When merchandise is shipped to our guests, we estimate receipt based on historical experience. Revenue is deferred and a liability is established for sales returns based on historical return rates and sales for the return period. We recognize an asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales for our right to recover returned merchandise. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities and return assets. For merchandise sold in our stores and online, tender is accepted at the point of sale. When we receive payment before the guest has taken possession of the merchandise, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the transaction is complete. Our performance obligations for unfulfilled merchandise orders are typically satisfied within one week. Shipping and handling fees charged to guests relate to fulfillment activities and are included in net sales with the corresponding costs recorded in cost of sales. The balance of receivables from customers as of January 1, 2021 was $66,305.

 

Cost of Sales

 

Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network and online fulfillment centers.

 

Net Income per Share

 

The Company computes basic and diluted income per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity.

 

The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible securities and preferred stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.

 

The following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards and their respective tax bases.

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income (loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

 

The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 

Tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return. The Company has no liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized as interest expense. The Company does not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any significant interest expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

NOTE 5 – CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE

 

Convertible Note Payable

 

On April 1, 2018, the Company assumed a convertible promissory note in connection with the reverse acquisition. The Company received total funding of $106,092 as of December 31, 2018. The note had fees of $53,046 which were recorded as a discount to the convertible promissory note and are being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. The maturity of the note is March 5, 2023. On March 5, 2023, the note was extended to September 5, 2023.

 

The note is convertible into common stock at a price of 35% of the lowest three trading prices during the ten days prior to conversion or 35% of an estimated fair value if not traded.

 

The note balance was $106,092 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 

Derivative liabilities

 

The conversion features embedded in the convertible notes were evaluated to determine if such conversion feature should be bifurcated from its host instrument and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. In the convertible notes with variable conversion terms, the conversion feature was accounted for as a derivative liability. The derivatives associated with the term convertible notes were recognized as a discount to the debt instrument and the discount is amortized over the expected life of the notes with any excess of the derivative value over the note payable value recognized as additional interest expense at the issuance date.

 

                                                                   24

NOTE 10 – LEASE LIABILITY

 

Operating Leases

 

The Company leases office space. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases in our consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For leases beginning in 2018 and later, the Company accounts for lease components separately from the non-lease components. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of the lease renewal options is at the sole discretion of the Company. The depreciable life of the assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.

 

The Company leases approximately 18,000 square feet of space in Haltom City, Texas, pursuant to a month-to-month lease. This facility serves as our corporate headquarters, manufacturing facility and showroom. The lease is with M & M Real Estate, Inc. (“M & M”), a company owned solely by our majority shareholder and director of the Company.

 

On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease that expires June 30, 2024. The operating lease result in the recognition of ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet. ROU asset and operating lease liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease terms of the commencement date. Because the leases do not provide an explicit or implicit rate of return, the Company determines incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments on an individual lease basis. The incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments for the asset under similar term, which is 5.50%. The Company’s lease does not contain any material restrictive covenants. The lease has a remaining term of 1.5 years.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Changes to Internal Controls and Procedures over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the annual period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness, as defined by SEC rules, is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that were identified are:

 

a) The Company’s lack of independent directors, the Company intends to appoint additional independent directors;

 

b) Lack of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;

 

c) Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting;

 

d) Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.

 

As a result of the existence of these material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

 

                                                                   28

 

 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

 

Changes to Internal Controls and Procedures over Financial Reporting

 

We intend that our internal control over financial reporting will be modified during our most recent year by adding additional advisors to address deficiencies in the financial closing, review and analysis process, which will improve our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Management’s Remediation Plans

 

To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures:

 

     ●    The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint additional member(s) to the Audit

           Committee.

     ●    The Company will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to affect a timely, accurate

           preparation of the financial

           statements.

     ●    The Company will hire staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting.

     ●    Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting

           policies and

           procedures.

 

The additional hiring is contingent upon the Company’s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results of its operations. Management expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.

PART III

 

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

 

The following table sets forth the names and ages of our current directors and executive officers. Also, the principal offices and positions with us held by each person and the date such person became our director, executive officer. Our executive officers are appointed by our Board of Directors. Our directors serve until the earlier occurrence of the election of his or her successor at the next meeting of stockholders, death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors. There are no family relationships among our directors, executive officers, director nominees.

 

Name                          Age         Position

Marc Johnson                      53      Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman

 

Marc Johnson, CEO and Chairman. Mr. Johnson earned a Business Administration Degree from Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1993. Mr. Johnson has been in the promotional products industry for over 35 years and started his first business in high school. Upon graduation from TCU, Mr. Johnson sold his first business to pursue a full-time career in the promotional products industry. Mr. Johnson excelled in sales and built his customer annual sales to over $1 million in his first three years. Mr. Johnson’s talents were noticed by a customer who convinced him to leave and start a new promotional products company with his customers’ financial backing. In 2010, Mr. Johnson bought out his financial backer and started Just Right Products, Inc.

 

                                                                   29

 

 

 

Our directors are elected at the annual meeting of the shareholders, with vacancies filled by the Board of Directors, and serve until their successors are elected and qualified, or their earlier resignation or removal. Officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any action required can be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation which may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if consent of consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principle place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings are recorded.

 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers

 

Nevada Corporation Law allows for the indemnification of officers, directors, and any corporate agents in terms sufficiently broad to indemnify such persons under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement for expenses, incurred arising under the 1933 Act. The Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law and such right to indemnification will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company and will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and Consultants; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred will include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including attorney’s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

 

The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Company similar to those conferred to directors and officers of the Company. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses are subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act to the extent applicable.

 

Furthermore, the Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another company against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Nevada General Corporation Law.

 

Board Composition

 

Our bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members. Each director of the Company serves for a term of one year or until a successor is elected at the Company’s annual shareholders meeting and is qualified, subject to removal by the Company’s shareholders. Each officer serves, at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, for a term of one year and until a successor is elected at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors and is qualified.

 

Involvement on Certain Material Legal Proceedings During the Last Five Years

 

No director, officer, significant employee or consultant has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, exclusive of traffic violations.

 

No bankruptcy petitions have been filed by or against any business or property of any director, officer, significant employee or consultant of the Company nor has any bankruptcy petition been filed against a partnership or business association where these persons were general partners or executive officers.

 

No director, officer, significant employee or consultant has been permanently or temporarily enjoined, barred, suspended or otherwise limited from involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities.

 

No director, officer or significant employee has been convicted of violating a federal or state securities or commodities law.

 

                                                                   30

 

 

Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance

 

ADM Endeavors, Inc. does not have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance insuring our directors and officers against liability for acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers.

 

Code of Ethics

 

We intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size. We intend to adopt a written code of ethics in the near future.

 

Corporate Governance & Board Independence

 

Our Board of Directors consists of two directors and has not established a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent.

 

Due to our lack of operations and size, and since we are not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we are not subject to any listing requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees; all functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company’s development, and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors.

 

We believe that members of our board of directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date.

 

Board Leadership Structure and the Board’s Role in Risk Oversight.

 

The Board of Directors is led by the Chairman who is also the controlling shareholder. The Company has two directors, and a Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer (roles currently filled by a single executive officer) reporting to the Board of Directors. Our structure provides the Company with multiple leaders who represent the Company to our stockholders, regulators, business partners and other stakeholders, among other reasons set forth below.

 

     ●         This structure creates efficiency in the preparation of the meeting agendas and related Board materials as the

                Company’s Chief Executive Officer works directly with those individuals preparing the necessary Board materials and is

                more connected to the overall daily operations of the Company. Agendas are also prepared with the permitted input of

                the full Board of Directors allowing for any concerns or risks of any individual director to be discussed as deemed

                appropriate. The Board believes that the Company has benefited from this structure is in the best interest of the

                stockholders.

                

     ●         The Company believes this structure allows for efficient and effective oversight, given the Company’s relatively small

                size, its corporate strategy and

                focus.

 

The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and employees of the Company provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the Company’s risks.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

Family Relationships

 

Marc Johnson and Sarah Nelson are siblings.

 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

 

Our Board of Directors has not established a separate compensation committee. Instead, the Board of Directors reviews and approves executive compensation policies and practices, reviews salaries and bonuses for our officer(s), decides on benefit plans, and considers other matters as may, from time to time, be referred to it. We do not currently have a Compensation Committee Charter. Our Board continues to emphasize the important link between our performance, which ultimately benefits all shareholders, and the compensation of our executives. Therefore, the primary goal of our executive compensation policy is to closely align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executive officer(s). In order to achieve this goal, we attempt to (i) offer compensation opportunities that attract and retain executives whose abilities and skills are critical to our long-term success and reward them for their efforts in ensuring our success and (ii) encourage executives to manage from the perspective of owners with an equity stake in us.
