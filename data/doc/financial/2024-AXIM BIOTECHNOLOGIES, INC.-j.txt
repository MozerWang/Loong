AXIM BIOTECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

 

NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION

 

AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in Nevada on November 18, 2010, as Axim International Inc. On July 24, 2014, the Company changed its name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. to better reflect its business operations. The Company’s principal executive office is located at 6191 Cornerstone Court E Suite 114 San Diego, California 92121. 

 

On October 16, 2018, the Company formed a wholly owned disregarded entity Marina Street, LLC as part of improvement of internal control over cash management and bank activities. In March 2020, we acquired Sapphire Biotech, Inc. (“Sapphire”), a diagnostic healthcare solutions company, changing our business operations. Sapphire’s operations are located in the greater San Diego, California area.

 

Russia-Ukraine and Israeli-Hamas wars impact and related risks

 

The ongoing wars in Russia-Ukraine and Israeli-Hamas conflict could impact global supply chains. This could impact business operations by effecting the company’s ability to procure necessary supplies and equipment. This could possibly interrupt the continuing sale of tests which would eliminate the company’s only source of revenue.

 

In addition to operational adjustments, the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine and Israeli- Hamas conflicts have led to uncertainties related to The Company’s business growth and ability to forecast the demand for its diagnostic testing and resulting revenues.

 

The full extent to which the Russia-Ukraine and Israeli- Hamas conflicts and the various responses to it might impact The Company’s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are not subject to accurate prediction and that are beyond The Company’s control.

 

In addition the impact of inflation on the Company’s ability to purchase supplies and manufacture products in a cost effective manner is currently unknown.

 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 pandemic, as it was declared by the World Health Organization, has continued to spread and has already caused severe global disruptions. The extent of COVID-19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.

 

We expect COVID-19, along with the resulting government-imposed restrictions on businesses, to negatively impact our operations due to decreased consumer demand as well as potential production and warehouse limitations which results in an event or condition, before consideration of management’s plans, that could impact our ability to meet future obligations.

 

NOTE 2: ACQUISITION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF ADVANCED TEAR DIAGNOSTIC, LLC.

 

AXIM entered into two substantially contemporaneous transactions to acquire patents and 510(K) Licenses from Advance Tear Diagnostics, LLC (the “Seller”) (collectively, the “Asset Acquisition”) for a total amount of $4,520,000.

 

The first transaction occurred on July 29, 2021, in which AXIM purchased five patents (the “Patents”) from the Seller for $250,000 (which includes assuming and paying $30,000 of the Seller’s liabilities). The bulk of the purchase price ($210,000) was in a note that requires seven equal monthly payments of $30,000, which payment started on September 3, 2021. 

 

 

                                                                   7



Table of Contents

 

The second transaction occurred on August 26, 2021, in which AXIM purchased certain eye disease diagnostic technology, which consisted of a 510(K) license for Lactoferrin, a biomarker for dry eye disease and a 510(K) license for IgE, a biomarker for allergic ocular reaction (collectively, the “510(K) Licenses”). The purchase price for the 510(K) Licenses was $4,270,000, which price was paid by issuing to the Seller 7 million shares of AXIM restricted common stock.

 

Together, the Patents and the 510(K) Licenses constitute the acquired technology asset (the “Technology Asset”), which for accounting purposes, are considered one unit of account. We are amortizing the Technology Asset ratably over the 9.1 years average remaining life of the Patents. The net value of these intangibles as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 is $3,594,981 and $3,496,369 respectively.

 

In accordance with FASB’s requirements for accounting for business combinations (FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 805, Business Combinations (“Topic 805”)), since all of the value of this acquisition resides in one asset, the Technology Asset, we have accounted for this transaction as the acquisition of an asset. The seller had not been able to commercialize or complete development of the Technology Asset prior to the asset acquisition and AXIM has established an Ophthalmology Division to commercialize and market the diagnostic technology. In an asset acquisition, the total purchase price of the transaction, including transaction expenses, is allocated to the assets acquired based on the fair value of the assets acquired. In our acquisition of the Technology Asset, the total amount of the purchase price was allocated to the Technology Asset.

 

NOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. (formerly Axim International, Inc.) as of March 31, 2024, and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”).

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axim Biotechnologies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Axim Holdings, Inc., Marina Street LLC, Axim Biotechnologies (the Netherland Company) and Sapphire Biotech, Inc. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

NOTE 4: GOING CONCERN

 

The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has negative working capital of $4,706,095 and has an accumulated deficit of $72,477,157, has cash used in operating activities of operations $1,067,061. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company raised additional capital of $95,599 and $175,000 through Stock Purchase Agreements. This capital provides funds for research, development, and ongoing operations. The Company intends to raise substantial additional capital through private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. That will raise a doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation 

 

NOTE 5: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates are assumptions about collection of accounts receivable, useful life of intangible assets, impairment analysis, derivative liability and assumptions used in Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend rate, for leases weighted number of life and discount rate.

 

 

                                                                   8

Operating lease

 

We lease property under various operating leases which are disclosed on our Balance sheet in accordance with ASC 842.

 

Risks and uncertainties

 

The Company operates in a dynamic and highly competitive industry and is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, contract manufacturer and contract research organizations, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance and reporting. The Company believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows; ability to obtain future financing; advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; results of clinical trials; regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company’s products; development of sales channels; certain strategic relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, product, regulatory, or other factors; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.

 

Products developed by the Company require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained or maintained, that the products will receive the necessary approvals, or that any approved products will be commercially viable. If the Company was denied approval, approval was delayed or the Company was unable to maintain approval, it could have a materially adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and substantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants and other third parties.

 

Beginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), or coronavirus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, has evolved into a global pandemic. The extent of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the Company’s business will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s clinical trial activities, research activities and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. The Company has expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of product candidates. The Company also will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and to provide for the marketing and distribution of products that receive regulatory approval. The Company may require additional funds to commercialize its products. The Company is unable to entirely fund these efforts with its current financial resources. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources of financing, the Company may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs which would materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and operations.

 

There have been no material changes in the accounting policies from those disclosed in the financial statements and the related notes included in the Form 10-K. 

 

 

                                                                   9

NOTE 5: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 

 

Cash equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company had no uninsured balances at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

It is the Company’s policy to review accounts receivable at least on a monthly basis for conductibility and follow up with customers accordingly. Covid19 has slowed collection as our customers are in a mandated pause. We do not have geographic concentration of customers.

 

Concentrations

 

At March 31, 2024, there was no accounts receivable. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, one customer accounted for 100% of total revenue. Revenue was all generated from normal operations for the three months  ending March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

 

Property and equipment

 

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful life. New assets and expenditures that extend the useful life of property or equipment are capitalized and depreciated. Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. The Company’s property and equipment relating to operations consisted of the following at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

                                                                                                          March 31,    December 31,  

                                                                                                            2024           2023

Equipment of operations                                                                                 $     259,631  $     256,792 

Less: accumulated depreciation                                                                                132,121        122,725 

                                                                                                        $     127,510  $     134,067 

 

Depreciation expense was $9,396 and $8,143 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conduct an impairment analysis for goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. Significant judgments are involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. There is no goodwill balance as of March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 

 

                                                                   10

Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

 

For indefinite-lived intangible assets such as in-process research and development (IPRD), we conduct an impairment analysis annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of the in-process research and development assets exceeds its fair value. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount of the in-process research and development assets, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the in-process research and development assets to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. There is no Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets balance as of March 31, 2024.

 

Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company regularly reviews the carrying value and estimated lives of all of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, to determine whether indicators of impairment exist that warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. The determinants used for this evaluation include management’s estimate of the asset’s ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of the assets to the Company’s business objectives. If the Company determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the realizability of its long-lived assets (asset group) based on a comparison of projected undiscounted cash flows from use and eventual disposition with the carrying value of the related asset. Any write-downs (which are measured based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset) are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets (asset group).

 

As at December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s long-lived assets were deemed impaired.

 

The Company’s intangible assets relating to operations consisted of the following at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:

 

                                                                                                          March 31,    December 31,  

                                                                                                            2024           2023      

Patents                                                                                                 $     250,000  $     250,000 

Licenses                                                                                                    4,270,000      4,270,000 

                                                                                                            4,520,000      4,520,000 

Less: accumulated amortization                                                                              1,023,631        925,019 

                                                                                                        $  3,496,369,  $   3,594,981 

 

Estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years ending December 31 is as follows: 

 

                                                        2024        2025        2026        2027        2028       2029 and    

                                                                                                                    onwards

Amortization expense                                 $  292,618  $  391,230  $  391,230  $  391,230  $  391,230  $  1,638,831 

 

Amortization expense recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was $98,612 and $98,612; respectively. 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company follows the guidance contained in Topic 606 (FASB ASC 606). The core principle of Topic 606 (FASB ASC 606) is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revenue recognition guidance contained in Topic 606, to follow the five-step revenue recognition model along with other guidance impacted by this standard: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transportation price; (4) allocate the transportation price; (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. All revenue was from operations that were divested.

 

 

                                                                   11



Table of Contents

 

 

Revenues are recognized when title for goods is transferred; non-refundable fees and proceeds from irrevocable agreements recognized when inflows or other enhancements of assets of the Company are received.

 

Revenues from operations recognized for the three months  ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 amounted to $52,979 and $7,397, respectively.

 

Collaboration Revenue

 

Revenue recognition for collaboration agreements will require significant judgment. The Company’s assessments and estimates are based on contractual terms, historical experience and general industry practice. Revisions in these values or estimations have the effect of increasing or decreasing collaboration revenue in the period of revision.

 

On August 21, 2020, the Company entered into a Distribution, License and Supply Agreement (“License Agreement”) with Empowered Diagnostics, LLC (“Empowered Diagnostics”“). The License Agreement provides Empowered Diagnostics with a right to commercialize the Company’s products worldwide with the exception of Mexico.

 

Under the License Agreement, the Company is responsible for applying for and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in the US and EU, as well as marketing, sales and distribution of the products. Empowered Diagnostics will pay a transfer price for all licensed products, and upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, the Company may receive payments from Empowered Diagnostics equal to 8% of the monthly gross revenue. Agreement continues until terminated by mutual consent or uncorrected breach.

 

This agreement with Empowered Diagnostics was terminated in February, 2022. The Company did not recognize any revenue from this agreement.

 

Grant Income

 

In 2021 the Company has received government grants to drive its research and development efforts. Through these government grants, the government has provided funding for the Company to perform research and development activities which will assist in developing its products. The Company believes the government entities funding these grants are interested in the Company advancing its underlying technologies through research activities and not providing incentives for hiring employees or building facilities that would suggest that the grant monies are not for specific research activities. These grants were not renewed and are no longer in effect.

 

In determining how to classify the monies received under government grants, the Company acknowledges that there is no specific guidance under US GAAP and that the FASB and AICPA have often drawn upon the guidance in IAS 20 for classification. In considering the alternatives provided by IAS 20 for the presentation of these grants in the Company’s financial statements, the Company believes that recognizing the government grant proceeds as a component of other revenue is a better reflection of the economics of the arrangements as the Company earns the funding through the performance of research and development which is not one of the Company’s primary business activities or central to its operations. The Company believes that presenting research and development funding from government grants, as other revenue provides consistency in our financial reporting. The Company also believes that this presentation clearly presents to users of its financial statements in one line the Company’s sources of funding from these grants. The Company notes that there are no contingencies associated with the receipt of or ability to retain the funds under the grant, other than undertaking and performing the related research and development activities. 

 

The Company recognizes funds received from contractual research and development services and from government grants as other revenue. These contracts and grants are not considered an ongoing major and central operation of the Company’s business. Our Income from Grants from Government for the  three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, was $-0- and $-0- respectively.

 

 

                                                                   12

Cost of Sales

 

Cost of sales includes the purchase cost of products sold and all costs associated with getting the products to the customers including buying and transportation costs. There was no cost of sales incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

 

Shipping Costs

 

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the company are recorded in general and administrative expenses. There were no shipping costs incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company applies the guidance that is codified under ASC 820-10 related to assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

 

The Company’s financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, and long-term debt. The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The recorded values of notes payable and long-term debt approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates.

 

ASC 820-10 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820-10 requires valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:

 

     Fair Value                                               Inputs to Fair Value Methodology

     Hierarchy

      Level 1         Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

                       judgment

 

All items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon Level 3 inputs. 

 

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 

The Company recognizes its derivative liabilities as Level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed below. While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed are that of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company.

Convertible Instruments

 

The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards for “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

 

Professional standards generally provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instruments are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of “Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument.”

 

The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when “Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features,” as those professional standards pertain to “Certain Convertible Instruments.” Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. 

 

ASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company follows Section 740-10, Income tax (“ASC 740-10”) Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax Bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

 

                                                                   14

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of any existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of any recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25.

 

No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is not aware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023.

 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “Cares Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act included loans and grants to certain businesses, and temporary amendments to the Internal Revenue Code which changed net loss carryforward and back provisions and the business interest expenses limitation. Under the CARES Act provisions, the most relevant income tax considerations to the Company relate to the amounts received under the Paycheck Protection Program loan program and the possible forgiveness of those loans by the SBA.

 

On December 21, 2020, the U.S. president has signed into law the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” which includes further COVID-19 economic relief and extension of certain expiring tax provisions. The relief package includes a tax provision clarifying that businesses with forgiven PPP loans can deduct regular business expenses that are paid for with the loan proceeds for federal tax purposes. Additional pandemic relief tax measures include an expansion of the employee retention credit, enhanced charitable contribution deductions, and a temporary full deduction for business expenses for food and beverages provided by a restaurant. 

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $-0- and $-0- allowance for doubtful accounts at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and had $-0- accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Net Loss per Common Share

 

Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the member potentially outstanding during each period. In periods when a net loss is experienced, only basic net loss per share is calculated because to do otherwise would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”) is presented in conformity with ASC 260-10 “Earnings Per Share.”

 

Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 as the inclusion of 24,118,329 in stock options, 2,469,247 in warrants, and 343,290,099 in convertible notes would be anti-dilutive.

 

 

                                                                   15



Table of Contents

 

 

There were common share equivalents 370,377,675 at March 31, 2024 and 250,027,250 at December 31, 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 these potential shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would reduce net loss per share.

 

Stock Based Compensation

 

All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors, including any grants of restricted stock and stock options, are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation or other expense over the relevant service period. Stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance. Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached, or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued. The Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payment to Non-employees. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized as the stock options vest. The Company believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received. Stock options granted to non-employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic adjustments as such options vest and at the end of each reporting period, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the Company’s statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period the related services are rendered.

 

Research and Development

 

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (“ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company incurred research and development expenses of $15,495 and $20,336 from operations, respectively. The Company has entered into various agreements with CROs. The Company’s research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets until the services are rendered.

 

In November 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard around the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The new standard clarifies that contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination from an acquiree should initially be recognized by applying revenue recognition principles and not at fair value. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The impact of this standard will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions. 

 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The amendments in Update No. 2020-06 simplify the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. The provisions of these standards have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The main objective of the standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The update is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

 

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The main objective of the amendment is to modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of various Topics in the Codification. Certain amendments represent clarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. to eliminate disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded. The effective date for each amendment will be when the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.

 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

On May 1, 2020, the Company agreed to modify its existing convertible note with a principal balance of $4 million, 3.5% interest rate convertible note with the current holder of that note. There were two changes to the existing agreement – (a) the conversion price was reduced from the $1.50 conversion price in the original Note to $0.25 cents in the modified Note and (b) the term of the note was extended from the original maturity date of November 1, 2021, to November 1, 2026. The Company’s stock closed trading on the day of the modification at $0.13 per share. The amendment of this convertible Note was also evaluated under ASC Topic 470-50-40,”Debt Modifications and Extinguishments.” Based on the guidance, the instruments were determined to be substantially different due to the change in the conversion price being substantial, and debt extinguishment accounting was applied. The fair value of the modified convertible note was not different than the carrying value of the original note as such no extinguishment loss was recorded, The Note prior to the amendment of approximately $4 million, and the fair value of the Note and embedded derivatives after the amendment of approximately $4 million. There were no unamortized debt issuance costs and the debt discount associated with the original 2018 Note.

 

On January 23, 2023, Creditor agreed to waive and forfeit all interest accrued on the MMI Note through December 31, 2023, in the aggregate amount of $261,537, and to waive all prior defaults on the MMI Note through the Effective Date. Interest shall accrue on the MMI Note at the original rate of 3.5% per annum through September 30, 2023, and be payable on that date. Thereafter interest will be payable on a monthly basis beginning on August 1, 2023. In addition, the Conversion Price for the MMI Note is hereby reduced from $0.25 to $0.075 the reduction in conversion price was also effective January 23, 2023. This Agreement serves to modify and amend the MMI Note as set forth herein, in all other respects the terms of the MMI Note remain in full force and effect. The Company determined that the debt modification including conversion feature added resulted in a debt extinguishment due to the change in the fair values exceeding 10% of the debt carrying value. As a result of the debt modification the company recorded a gain on Extinguishment of debt in the amount of $261,537. 

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, interest expense was $35,000 and $35,000, respectively.

NOTE 14: STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT

 

Preferred Stock

 

The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Of the 5,000,000 authorized preferred shares, 4,000,000 are undesignated “blank check” preferred stock. The Company may issue such preferred shares and designate the rights, privileges and preferences of such shares at the time of designation and issuance. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022 there are -0- and -0- shares of undesignated preferred shares issued and outstanding, respectively.

 

There are zero shares issued and outstanding of Series A and Series B Preferred stock as of December 31, 2023.

 

Series C Convertible Preferred Stock

 

On August 17, 2016 the Company designated up to 500,000 shares of a new Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (Series C Preferred Stock). The holders of the Series C Preferred are entitled to elect four members to the Company’s board of directors and are entitled to cast 100 votes per share on all other matters presented to the shareholders for a vote. Each share of Series C Convertible Preferred is convertible into one share of the Company’s common stock. The Series C Convertible Preferred designation contains a number of protective and restrictive covenants that restrict the Company from taking a number of actions without the prior approval of the holders of the Series C Preferred or the unanimous vote of all four Series C Directors. If at any time there are four Series C Directors, one such director must be independent as that term is defined in the Series C designation. Any challenge to the independence of a Series C Director is a right conferred only upon the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and may only be made by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

 

                                                                   24

On August 18, 2016 the Company issued all 500,000 shares of its newly designated Series C Preferred Stock to MJNA Investment Holdings, LLC in exchange for cash of $65,000. As the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, MJNA Investment Holdings, LLC has designated Dr. Timothy R. Scott, John W. Huemoeller II, Robert Cunningham and Blake Schroeder as their four Series C Directors.

 

On February 20, 2019, MJNA Investment Holdings LLC (“Seller”) sold its 500,000 shares of AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc.’s, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) Series C Preferred Stock to Juniper & Ivy Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Purchaser”) for a purchase price of $500,000 (the “Purchase Price”) pursuant to a Preferred Stock.

 

Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). Payment of the Purchase Price was made as follows (i) a $65,000 payment made by check payable to Seller, which Purchaser borrowed from an unrelated third-party and which has no recourse against the Series C Preferred Stock or assets of Purchaser (the “Loan”), and (ii) the issuance by Purchaser to Seller of a promissory note, face value, $435,000, which has no recourse against the Series C Preferred Stock or assets of Purchaser (the “Note”). The Company’s Chief Executive Officer John W. Huemoeller II is the President of Purchaser. Mr. Huemoeller provided a personal guaranty for the Loan and the Note.

 

The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to elect four members to the Company’s Board of Directors and are entitled to cast 100 votes per share on all other matters presented to the shareholders for a vote. As a result of this transaction, a change in control has occurred.

On July 14, 2022, the Company entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement with Cross & Company, pursuant to which we have the right to “put,” or sell, up to $30,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock to Cross. As provided in the Equity Purchase Agreement, we may require Cross to purchase shares of our common stock from time to time by delivering a put notice to Cross specifying the total number of shares to be purchased (such number of shares multiplied by the purchase price described below, the “Investment Amount”); provided there must be a minimum of ten trading days between delivery of each put notice. We may determine the Investment Amount, provided that such amount may not be more than 300% of the average daily trading volume in dollar amount for our common stock during the five trading days preceding the date on which we deliver the applicable put notice, unless waived by Cross in its sole discretion. Additionally, such amount may not be lower than $10,000 or higher than $250,000. Cross will have no obligation to purchase shares under the Equity Line to the extent that such purchase would cause Cross to own more than 4.99% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.

NOTE 17: COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES

 

On January 2, 2019 the Company entered into the term of Executive’s employment agreement, at a base salary of $10,000 per month with John W. Huemoeller II to serve as its Chief Executive Officer. The Company and Executive acknowledge and agree that Executive’s employment hereunder shall at all times be “at will,” which means that either Executive may resign at any time for any reason or for no reason, and that the Company may terminate Executive’s employment at any time for any reason or for no reason, in either case, subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement. In further consideration for Executive’s services and subject to the approval of the Board, Executive will be granted an option to purchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Option Shares”). The option will be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to stock options granted under the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”), and as described in the Plan and the stock option agreement, which Executive will be required to sign. 50% of the Option Shares shall vest on the date of grant and the remaining 50% of the Option Shares shall vest on the 12- month anniversary of the grant date, subject to Executive’s continued employment by the Company. The exercise price per share will be equal to the fair market value per share on the date of grant, as determined by the last closing price of the Company’s common stock the day prior to grant. Beginning in October 2019, the board decided to increase CEO base salary to $35,000 per month. 

 

On April 24, 2017 the company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Malasek, its Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. The agreement does not have a set term and may be terminated at any time by the Company or Mr. Malasek with proper notice. The shares were issued in the 1st quarter 2018. Beginning in October 2019, the board ratified to increase CFO base salary to $3,000 per month. During 2022 the board subsequently increased Mr. Malasek’s compensation to 7,500 per month.

 

Industry Sponsored Research Agreement— Sapphire entered into the Industry Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) effective February 7, 2020 to test and confirm the inhibitory activity of SBI-183 (exclusively licensed on January 13, 2020) and SBI-183 analogs, including those synthesized by the Company. The testing will include cell-based in vitro assays, NMR binding studies and testing to determine if SBI-183 enhances the activity of cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Animal studies will also be conducted under the SRA. Specifically, SBI-183 analogs will be evaluated in a mouse model of triple negative breast cancer using human tumor xenografts. The work will be performed over a period of one year with the total cost of the SRA totaling $150,468 paid prior to acquisition. For the year December 31, 2021, the Company recorded research and development expenses of $284,869. This agreement is now being renegotiated.

On August 25, 2020, we signed an exclusive licensing, manufacturing and distribution agreement with Empowered Diagnostics LLC to execute the high-volume production of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic test. AXIM and Empowered have completed the technology transfer and Empowered Diagnostics has built out their production facility to be able to manufacture millions of our neutralizing antibody tests for COVID-19 per month. In exchange for this license Empowered will pay Axim a royalty on net sales on all licensed products sold by Empowered covered by this license which global with the exception of Mexico.

 

This agreement was cancelled in February, 2022.

 

On September 15, 2022, the company entered into a license and distribution agreement for its Lactoferrin dry eye test, Ige allergy test for allergic conjunctivitis and quantitative MMp-9 test to identify ocular surface inflammation. The licensee is Versea Ophthalmics, LLC, A Delaware Limited Liability Company.

 

The agreement will provide Verséa with the exclusive commercial right to AXIM’s proprietary portfolio of point-of-care (POC) lab testing readers and three key biomarker diagnostic tests designed specifically to assist eye-care physicians in detecting and quantifying biomarkers associated with aqueous deficient Dry Eye Disease and non-specific allergic conjunctivitis. The three AXIM’s key biomarker tests – the Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE) test, the Lactoferrin test, and the future MMP-9 test – require the collection of 0.5 microliters in tears and provide quantitative results in under 10 minutes, an industry-leading return time.

 

Verséa plans to launch IgE and Lactoferrin tests at the upcoming 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and American Academy of Optometry (AAOPT) conferences. The MMP-9 test is anticipated to follow in the next 18-24 months. 

  

In recent months, AXIM has been preparing for the scaling of production of its tests in anticipation of an agreement such as the one reached with Verséa and is now prepared to support new orders associated with the agreement and subsequent launch.

 

Due to the Agreement, the positions of: (i) National Sales Director; and (ii) Chief Medical Officer held by Jeff Busby and Dr. Joseph Tauber, respectively, were no longer necessary for Company operations and, therefore, eliminated.

 

The Company received an initial license fee of $150,000 and has the right to cancel the agreement if minimum sales targets are not reached. This amount was recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over 5 years beginning September 15, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized $7,479 and $7,397. The carrying balance as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $103,648 and $111,209, respectively.

 

The Company also received $192,000 towards sale of its IgE and Lactoferrin tests. The tests were not shipped as of December 31, 2023 so the amount was disclosed as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023. During the quarter ending March 31, 2024 4,550 in tests were shipped at 11 per test resulting in revenue recognition of $45,500; leaving a carrying value of $146,500.

Historical Business Operations

 

We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, under the name AXIM International, Inc. On July 24, 2014, we changed our name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc.

 

The Company’s historical business operations focused on the research, development and production of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products based upon our proprietary technologies. This business and its related intellectual property were divested by the Company in May, 2020.

 

In March 2020, we acquired Sapphire Biotech, Inc. (“Sapphire”), a diagnostic healthcare solutions company, changing our business operations.

 

Acquisition of Sapphire Biotech, Inc.

 

On March 17, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sapphire and all of its stockholders, pursuant to which, upon closing of the transaction, we: (i) acquired 100% of Sapphire’s outstanding capital, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock; and (ii) assumed all of the outstanding debt of Sapphire. The outstanding debt included two convertible notes in the principal amounts of $310,000 and $190,000, respectfully.

 

In exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sapphire, we issued an aggregate of 54,000,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock to Sapphire’s existing stockholders (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Sapphire became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which has resulted in consolidated financial reporting by the Company to include the results of Sapphire.

 

Acquisition of Advanced Tear Diagnostics, LLC Technology

 

On August 26, 2021, we purchased certain eye disease diagnostic technology from Advanced Tear Diagnostics, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“Advanced Tear”), consisting of worldwide exclusive licenses to manufacture, distribute and sell 510(k) cleared medical diagnostic devices already being marketed for Lactoferrin, a biomarker for dry eye disease and a 510(k) license for IgE, a biomarker for allergic ocular reaction and ownership of the two FDA registered 510(k) clearances (collectively, the “DED Licenses”). Pursuant to the agreement, AXIM became the FDA registered owner of the two 510(k)’s. The purchase price for the technology licenses and the 510(k)’s was $4,270,000, which price was paid by issuing 7,000,000 restricted shares of Company common stock to Advanced Tear.

 

This asset purchase will prohibit another company from manufacturing the same devices under the 510(k)’s now owned by AXIM. Companies wishing to compete with AXIM by manufacturing the diagnostic devices acquired by AXIM must initiate a new 510(k) application and conduct costly clinical trials in support of the lengthy clearance process.

 

Also on August 26, 2021, we purchased technology and intellectual property relating to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy which included five pending patent applications, one of which has now been allowed by the US Patent & Trademark Office, from Advanced Tear for $250,000 (included assuming and paying $30,000 of the Advanced Tear liabilities). The bulk of the purchase price ($210,000) was in a note that requires seven equal monthly payments of $30,000, which payment started on September 3, 2021. The note has since been repaid in full.

 

Eye Health Overview

 

On August 26, 2021, we acquired the technology, intellectual property and the exclusive global rights to market two FDA cleared lateral flow assays which utilize a non-invasive, quantitative, point of care human tear test to aid in the diagnosis and selection of therapeutics for the treatment of eye diseases. With the acquisition, the Company became focused on improving the landscape for the diagnosis of ophthalmological conditions such as Dry Eye Disease (DED) through rapid diagnostic tests. The Company owns two of the only five FDA Cleared Diagnostic tests for Dye Eye Disease.

 

Currently, we have an FDA 510(k) clearance to test Lactoferrin (an aqueous deficiency biomarker) and IgE (a non-specific allergy biomarker). Our objective is to establish point of care testing for dry eye disease (“DED”) and to establish this modality as the new standard of care. The tests are quick, simple to use, and inexpensive to the clinic. The tests are CMS and private insurance reimbursable.

 

Low levels of Lactoferrin confirm inadequate glandular tear production (aqueous deficiency) and high levels of IgE indicate an active ocular allergy. If both biomarkers are normal, the cause of a patient’s dry eye condition could be attributed to evaporative dry eye. So, by performing these two tests, an eye doctor may now better assess the underlying cause of the tear film disorder, its severity and the appropriate treatment protocol to pursue. In addition, these tests are rapid, accurate, reimbursable, profitable and can be performed by a technician, which allows the physician to be more productive and attend to more patients.

 

 

                                                                   32

While at one time the tests were sold in numerous eye doctors’ locations, when the Company acquired the assays, they had been mothballed. The Company has had to redevelop the tests, reagents and select a quantitative reader. Since the acquisition of the technology, the Company has been successful in redevelopment and is launching sales.

 

We have signed a supply agreement with Barcelona-based IUL SA (“IUL”) for our iPeak DED readers, which will be deployed for diagnostic testing with a focus on Lactoferrin and IgE levels. This state-of-the-art portable reader is a colorimetric lateral flow reader designed to hold different cassette sizes and can read cassettes of up to five strips and seven lines per strip at a time.

 

iPeak is equipped with “Flash Eye” technology based on the principles of machine vision illumination. Its camera captures the image of the test illuminated from LED lights situated in the most studied geometry to achieve a precise and uniform illumination and enhance the colors of any lateral flow test. The iPeak technology also allows for more sensitivity, which is the main success of its application. 

 

We evaluated the iPeak readers in the lab against several other comparable products before deciding on IUL’s state-of-the-art products. The Company’s diagnostic testing process for DED, and specifically for Lactoferrin levels as a primary indicator, will include the use of reagent strip samples. The new readers are calibrated with the new test strips and will be distributed to ophthalmologists and optometrists at the point of care. The patients’ tear sample will be obtained and applied to the strips and then an ophthalmologist or optometrist will run the strips through a reader to determine Lactoferrin levels and incidence and severity of DED.

 

On September 19, 2022 the Company announced that it had signed an exclusive global commercialization agreement with Verséa Ophthalmics, LLC, a business division of Verséa Holdings, Inc. (“Verséa”), is one of the fastest growing U.S. healthcare companies, specialized in the sale and distribution of diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.

 

Our tests are considered moderately complex by CLIA. This requires the user of the test to obtain a CLIA certificate of compliance. This is done by filing a simple application with CMS (Form 116) and paying a fee. However, there are various lab requirements that must be in place first, and there is a considerable amount of ongoing record keeping that is required, which restricts potential growth of the business.

 

The FDA allows for CLIA waivers, and we intend to pursue a waiver for both current tests and all future product offerings. Our scientists have been diligently making patentable improvements to the tests which will simplify use by the clinician and enhance likelihood of CLIA waiver approval. We plan to file for the waiver in the second quarter of 2024 after conducting a fairly simple comparative clinical study. The objective will be to determine whether the AXIM Eye test system has equal or better simplicity than the other forms of diagnostic testing for DED, which we believe is the case. This study is a key component of the filing process with the FDA for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) Certificate of Waiver. We believe that the acquisition of these FDA 510(k) cleared diagnostic products, a waiver and the distribution partnership we have with Versea will allow the business to grow at a rapid pace.

 

Dye Eye Market

 

An estimated 16 million Americans have been diagnosed with DED, but the actual number of Americans suffering from dry eye symptoms is likely much higher. Some reports indicate that nearly half of all U.S. adults experience dry eye signs and symptoms, and 33% of patients in eye care clinics present with complaints about dry eye.

 

DED, though widespread, is under-diagnosed, in part because symptoms do not always correlate with objective signs. It has a highly variable symptom profile at different stages of the disease, and there is often a discordance between signs and symptoms. A patient can have severe symptoms yet show no sign of ocular surface damage, while others have advanced ocular surface damage, yet report no symptoms. This lack of correlation between clinical signs and symptoms of DED makes diagnosing and treating patients a challenge. Often times, inflammation is present before the clinical signs of DED.

Currently, our eye business focuses exclusively on ophthalmology and optometry, in the United States, where there are 37,000 optometrists and 19,000 ophthalmologists performing approximately 400,000 medical (dilated) eye exams per day. Of this total, we believe that approximately 20% to 30% would present with symptoms where the Company’s Lactoferrin and IgE tests would be indicated. It is estimated that total US market for our eye care systems could approach 50,000 systems (USA Only).

 

We have completed development of our immunoassay system, which includes an automated colorimetric photometer reader and two FDA market-cleared point-of-care (POC) quantitative diagnostic ophthalmic lab tests and are now manufacturing the tests. These are:

 

Ocular Lactoferrin Lf) CPT code 83520 2021 CMS reimbursement $17.27/eye *

 

Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE) CPT Code 83520 2021 CMS reimbursement $16.46/eye* 

 

Studies indicate that in 2021, 16-49 million Americans had DED, representing 32 - 98 million potential use cases for our POC tests. These tests are not limited to DED diagnostics, but can also be used to determine the Lactoferrin and allergic components of tear film prior to:

 

     ●    Contact lens fitting – approximately 45 million people wear contact lens in the US alone (2021).



     ●    LASIK surgery- approximately 718,000 (2020).



     ●    Cataract surgery with lens exchange - approximately 3.8 million (2018).

 

The barrier for entrance into the dry eye space is difficult and requires extensive clinical studies, large capital expense and FDA 510(k) clearance. This process alone can take several years and substantial investment, with no certainty that the product will receive FDA 510(k) clearance. For this reason, the Company determined that acquiring the two 510(k)’s would be a favorable strategic decision.

 

Business Model 

 

Our eye business model utilizes a razor/razor blade model with the idea of placing as many readers into the field as possible and selling the disposable tests. It is anticipated that our gross profits will be generated from the manufacturing and sale of tests to our distribution partner who then resells the tests. Discounts will be offered to purchasing groups, corporate accounts, academic institutions engaged in research or training, and others as deemed appropriate. It is anticipated that the average price for the reader will be at our acquisition cost so we can get as many “razors” in the field, while pricing of consumable diagnostic kits will be at roughly half of the CMS published reimbursement floor rate. 

 

Market demand for the system is expected to be moderate to begin with until we are granted a waiver from CLIA. At which time we expect extremely high demand for our system and tests. We also expect very high demand for our recently developed MMP-9 quantitative test once we obtain a FDA 510(k) clearance. While we must compete with other capital equipment expenditures under consideration in any ophthalmic physician’s office, we believe that no other ophthalmic device offers the combination of compelling clinical and financial benefits afforded by our system. The clinical utility of the tests offers important diagnostic precision, differentiation and treatment management direction. Inner-office efficiencies significantly improve the patient flow characteristics, reducing patients in office visit time and greatly reducing physicians chair time with each patient.

 

Financially, for every patient tested per day, the physician will receive, on average, $2 in reimbursement for every $1 expended on supplies. CMS and private insurance allow for physicians to retest their patients as often as deemed medically necessary.

The preferred clinical analysis is quantitative, giving us an advantage over the competition. Since our reader can interpret many different analytes other than Lf and IgE, it also opens the possibility of additional quantitative test development.

 

New Quantitative MMP-9 Test

 

On March 8, 2022, we announced that we had successfully developed what we believe to be the first-ever rapid quantitative tear test for MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker for DED. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an inflammatory biomarker consistently elevated in the tears of dry eye patients, may accelerate early diagnosis when detected.

 

Ocular surface disease (OSD) and dry eye syndrome are often mistakenly considered synonymous. OSD occurs when there is damage to the front surface of the eyes, the cornea. The central role of inflammation in OSD is widely recognized, but the ability to measure this in the clinic has been limited to the Quidel InflammaDry test, which measures tear matrix MMP-9 levels and provides a positive/negative result around a threshold of 40ng/ml of MMP-9. This “yes or no” report has clinical value, but it is limited. Currently available MMP-9 testing does not detect a reduction in tear MMP-9 levels until the concentration drops below 40ng/ml and, thus, may miss clinically significant improvement that did not reach that threshold.

 

The clinical benefits of our quantitative tear MMP-9 testing would be a significant advancement in the ability to measure the degree of inflammation affecting dry eye patients, allowing for more objective classification of their disease. Equally important would be the ability to measure improvement in control of inflammation that is the goal of many of our therapies for Ocular Surface Disease (OSD), including pharmaceuticals, thermal pulsation treatments and even light based therapies.

 

We intend to run a clinical study for MMP-9 in the 3rd quarter of 2024. The distribution agreement we have with Versea calls for Versea to pay for half of the expense in return for a paid up license to market the test after the 510(k) clearance is achieved.

 

We are also in the process of developing additional biomarker tests that will be used on the existing platform, without the constant need of the clinician to upgrade to a newer platform. The Lateral Flow test reader is software driven and can be programmed to interpret other biomarkers as they are clinically studied and FDA approved. The test uses 1.0 microliters of human tear fluid, that is applied to a disposable lateral flow cassette (one cassette per patient tested). The disposable single use cassette generates a substantial, recurring revenue stream for our eye business and our stakeholders. 

 

 

                                                                   35

CURRENT OPERATIONS FOLLOWING ACQUISITION OF SAPPHIRE AND ADVANCED TEAR DIAGNOSTICS ASSETS

 

Summary:

 

     ●    AXIM’s strategic focus is on commercializing FDA-cleared Dry Eye Disease (DED) diagnostic system

     ●    Plans to address largely underserved DED diagnosis market with patent pending tear collection method and approved tests,

           supported by world-class DED management

           team

     ●    Supply agreements in place to fulfill demand for DED readers and test strips, creating large revenue opportunity

     ●    Company places emphasis on generating positive cash flow through DED program

 

The Company has been working diligently to further position AXIM for both immediate and long-term success. Since our acquisition of Sapphire Biotech and with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on three key areas specific to the diagnostic area: oncological, COVID-19, and most recently, dry eye disease (DED). Each of these provide strong upside potential for AXIM; however, each comes with its own set of regulatory and scientific hurdles that must be overcome. While the Company remains optimistic about each program, we believe it to be of the utmost importance to focus the most time and resources on the program with the ultimate potential for success, in the nearest term. While these other programs will not be abandoned, the Company recognizes that waiting on the painstaking slow regulatory approvals needed to generate revenue is not the best strategy to further our mission and unlock shareholder value. As such, following an extensive analysis by our management team, board of directors, and expert consultants with an objective perspective, the Company determined our best path forward lies with DED. The DED initiative is an extremely large opportunity for our Company and has been gaining strong momentum in recent months. The Company believes it offers the most potential for rapid and immediate growth, which could lead to ultimate profitability for the organization.

 

Since the third quarter of 2021, we have acquired substantial assets, including already approved diagnostic tests, which complement the research we had been conducting to-date. Despite DED being the most common ocular surface disorder, affecting approximately 350 million people worldwide—causing persistent eye irritation, blurred vision, pain and decreased quality of life—the sector has seen little innovation. There remains a desperate demand for better DED testing and diagnosis, especially at the point-of-care, and we believe we are well positioned to dominate this marketplace, while we actively work to develop and bring to market new solutions enabling us to offer comprehensive state-of-the-art suite of DED solutions.

 

Our next-generation solutions are unique in that they offer patients not only a fast and reliable answer as to why they are suffering, but offer a solution to physicians who are looking to help patients suffering from this overly common disease.

 

COVID Neutralizing Antibodies

 

Over the past few years, as COVID ravaged the world, our scientific team proved its world-class scientific acumen by swiftly developing first-in class COVID-19 neutralizing antibody tests. Shortly after its development, we filed for Emergency Use Authorization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), signed a distribution and manufacturing agreement, initiated live virus comparison studies, and filed several patent applications on the diagnostic tools. We waited in anticipation that the FDA would move quickly given the nature of the pandemic; however, we were disappointed week after week until we finally received a response that the FDA had changed its guidance and that they were denying our application. This was unfortunate especially given our firm belief in the efficacy of our test and the potential to assist in the global fight against this virus. That said, we are fearful that the U.S. government’s drive to approve such solutions is fading, and that it is unlikely to grant an EUA to ours or similar tests in the near future, although it is still a possibility since this virus is likely going to be around for a long time. It is this realism that further compelled readjustment of our focus on the DED program.

 

 

                                                                   36

DED Business

 

It is important to underscore the rationale supporting the Company’s decision to focus on DED. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, approximately 20 million people in the U.S. have DED and the number is growing in both young and old adults. It is imperative that clinicians determine how to best diagnose and treat DED.

 

Diagnosing DED is a particular challenge because of the multifactorial nature of the disease, with symptoms similar to other ocular surface conditions. There is often discordance between signs and symptoms, highlighting the need for more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tools. Figures from the American Journal of Ophthalmology corroborate this. As of July 2017, an estimated six million people reported DED symptoms without receiving a diagnosis.

 

The DED marketplace is massive, with analysts projecting the global market to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2021 to 2026 and reach $6.1 billion by 2024.

 

Accordingly, in mid-2021, we started building the infrastructure and foundation needed to engage this large and dynamic market successfully. Our cutting-edge, next-generation solutions provide AXIM with far higher prospects of predictable growing revenue and earnings power.

 

On August 26, 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire two FDA-cleared 510(k)’s DED diagnostic testing technologies. The tests are part of a highly specialized point-of-care (POC) lab testing system explicitly designed to assist eye care physicians in detecting and quantifying various biomarkers associated with external ocular disorders. The tests are also approved for insurance and Medicare reimbursement. Both these tests are non-invasive, Rapid Lateral Flow Assays using tears.

 

The first is a rapid (10-minute) lateral flow diagnostic assay that tests for exact levels of Lactoferrin through the collection of 1.0 microliter in tears. The benefits of testing Lactoferrin Levels in the tear film include:

 

     ●    Low Lactoferrin levels directly correlate to DED caused by aqueous deficiency

     ●    The severity of DED can be determined by the Lactoferrin level

     ●    Low Lactoferrin levels may represent increased surgical risk or contact lens intolerance

     ●    Changes in Lactoferrin levels may show the efficacy of the prescribed treatment

 

The second test is for the measurement of Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE), a biomarker for allergies and a key biomarker primarily associated with Dry Eye Disease. The benefits of Testing IgE Levels in the Tear Film include:

 

     ●    The presence of IgE indicates the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis

     ●    Levels of IgE increase with the severity of the allergic response

     ●    IgE testing can help differentiate allergic conjunctivitis from dry eye syndrome

     ●    Allergic conjunctivitis is a contraindication for LASIK and other surgical procedures

 

Lactoferrin is a tear protein that protects the ocular surface through antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Lower concentrations of lactoferrin have been demonstrated in patients with dry eye, which is associated with decreased aqueous tear production. Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a biomarker for allergies and a key biomarker primarily associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Mild allergic conjunctivitis is frequently challenging to clinically distinguish from dry eye. AXIM’s diagnostic technology allows for eye doctors to not only identify and differentiate clinically overlapping conditions but also drive more targeted therapeutic interventions. The tests provide doctors with access to real-time quantitative results at the point-of-care, allowing them to better prescribe a therapy to patients, leading to overall improved personalized patient care.

 

On March 8, 2022 we announced that we had successfully developed what we believe to be the first-ever rapid quantitative tear test for MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker for DED. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an inflammatory biomarker consistently elevated in the tears of dry eye patients. The central role of inflammation in Ocular Surface Disease (OSD) is widely recognized, but the ability to measure this in the clinic has been limited to the Quidel InflammaDry test, which provides a positive/negative result. This “yes or no” report has clinical value, but it is limited. OSD occurs when there is damage to the front surface of the eyes, the cornea. OSD includes dry eye syndrome, but also refers to a number of other disorders that affect the surface of the eye and can cause significant issues with vision and quality of life.

 

 

                                                                   37

The clinical benefits of our quantitative tear MMP-9 testing are a significant advance in the ability to measure the degree of inflammation affecting dry eye patients, allowing for more objective classification of their disease. Equally important would be the ability to measure improvement in control of inflammation that is the goal of many therapies for OSD, including pharmaceuticals, thermal pulsation treatments and even light based therapies.

 

Key Diagnostic Device Supply Agreement 

 

In February of 2023, we entered into a key supply agreement for DED test strip readers which will be deployed for diagnostic testing, focusing on lactoferrin levels. The readers, a point of care medical device, will be supplied by Barcelona, Spain-based IUL SA (“IUL”). We will be utilizing state-of-the-art portable iPeak readers that were tested against other comparable products. These readers are designed to hold different cassette sizes and are equipped with connectivity and can read cassettes of up to five strips and seven lines per strip at a time. iPeak is equipped with “Flash Eye” technology based on the principles of machine vision illumination.

 

We are also in the process of developing additional biomarker tests that will be done on the existing platform, without the constant need of the clinician to upgrade to a newer platform. The Lateral Flow test reader is software-driven and can be programmed to interpret other biomarkers as they are clinically studied and FDA approved. The test uses 1.0 microliters of human tear fluid that is applied to a disposable lateral flow cassette (one cassette per patient tested). The disposable single use cassette generates a substantial, recurring revenue stream for our eye business. 

 

Exclusive Global Commercial Partnership

 

On September 19, 2022, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusive global commercialization agreement with Verséa Ophthalmics, LLC, a business division of Verséa Holdings, Inc. (“Verséa”), one of the fastest growing U.S. healthcare companies, specialized in the sale and distribution of ocular diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.

 

The agreement will provide Verséa with the exclusive commercial right to AXIM’s proprietary portfolio of point-of-care (POC) lab testing readers and three key biomarker diagnostic tests designed specifically to assist eye-care physicians in detecting and quantifying biomarkers associated with aqueous deficient Dry Eye Disease and non-specific allergic conjunctivitis. AXIM’s three key biomarker tests – the Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE) test, the Lactoferrin test, and the future MMP-9 test – require the collection of 1.0 microliters in tears and provide quantitative results in under 10 minutes, an industry-leading return time. 

 

On September 30, 2022, Verséa launched the IgE and Lactoferrin tests at the 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and American Academy of Optometry (AAOPT) conferences. The MMP-9 test is anticipated to follow in 2nd quarter 2024 upon FDA clearance. In recent months, AXIM has been preparing for the scaling of production of its tests in anticipation of significant new orders and is now prepared to support new orders associated with the Versea agreement and subsequent launch.

 

The commercial launch of the Company’s IgE and Lactoferrin tests mark the evolution of AXIM as a development-stage biotech company to a revenue generating healthcare organization. Since the development of our novel ocular diagnostic tests and subsequent success in proving their effectiveness, the Company had been searching for a partner with a solid commercial infrastructure and a firm commitment to eye care, capable of bringing our tests to clinical offices on a global scale. With existing sales channels to support their human amniotic membrane therapeutics, Verséa has added our technology to their expanding portfolio of healthcare solutions. Our partner’s mission aligns with that of the Company’s—together, we aim to change the landscape of dry eye disease diagnosis.

 

On October 4, 2022, the Company announced that it had received an initial order of 19,000 point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests and 100 readers targeting ocular surface diseases through its exclusive global commercialization partner Verséa Ophthalmics, marking the Company’s first large-scale revenue generating order. To date we have delivered approximately 4000 tests.--

 

 

                                                                   38

The order is part of the recently announced exclusive global commercialization agreement reached between Verséa and AXIM to support the commercial launch of sales at the 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) conference in Chicago. The order represents the largest revenue-generating event in the history of the Company. AXIM is completing the manufacturing and is preparing the order for shipment from its laboratory facilities in San Diego, California as per Verséa’s direction. The order includes both the tear-based tests for Lactoferrin and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) as well as 100 of the associated digital reader that allows for quantitative test results. The tests provide doctors with access to real-time quantitative results within 10 minutes, allowing them to more accurately diagnose and prescribe targeted therapy to patients, leading to overall improved personalized patient care. Both tests are FDA-cleared and have dedicated Medicare CPT codes that allow for rapid POC diagnosis of common ocular conditions such as dry eye disease (DED) and allergic conjunctivitis. On February 20, 2024 we announced that Verséa Ophthalmics placed an order for an additional 50 digital readers.

 

This large order through our agreement with Verséa Ophthalmics marks a pivotal point for AXIM, where we are revenue generating. This initial order through Versea also supports the Company’s vision that our tests and readers will become available in clinics nationwide. While our readers can be used over and over again, our test strips are one-time use, and we expect to receive repeat orders from clinicians who have performed the tests. This will be a significant revenue additive to the growing new test demand.

 

The expectation with the Versea partnership is that the launch of the ocular surface disease testing platform is the beginning of a robust testing pipeline of future diagnostic test solutions that can be introduced on the same digital reader system. Eye care professionals have struggled with differentiating mild allergic conjunctivitis from dry eye disease as well as distinguishing between different causes of dry eye [aqueous deficient versus evaporative] which impacts clinical decision making. The portfolio of rapid, tear-based, quantitative point of care tests allows for more specific diagnoses, targeted therapeutic intervention and the potential for therapeutic monitoring which is a true breakthrough for the industry. 

 

CLIA Waiver Process 

 

Commencing in the 2nd quarter of 2024, the Company plans to conduct a comparative clinical study. The objective will be to prove that the AXIM Eye test system has equal or better simplicity than the other forms of diagnostic testing for DED. This study is a key component of our filing process with the FDA for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) Certificate of Waiver. We will be targeting a waiver for both IgE and the Lactoferrin diagnostic tests. The testing is expected to prove that the products are simple to use with minimal risks of erroneous results. The expected timeline for filing and receiving a final CLIA decision is approximately three to six months.

 

Patented Tear Collection System

 

Tear fluid analysis contributes to the greater understanding of various ocular and systemic diseases. However, there is a pressing need for a better tear collection system. AXIM is developing and filed for a patent of a novel tear sample collector system that is extremely cost-effective to produce on a mass scale. It is soft, non-intimidating, and easy to use by untrained personnel. It features a simple indicator that appears on the strip when enough tear fluid has been absorbed.

 

AXIM 2023: Goals and Targeting Positive Cash Flow

 

Our DED business strategy is starting to take off. Looking ahead we plan to:

 

     ●    Successfully complete our clinical trials to prove the accuracy and ease of use to achieve CLIA waivers.

     ●    Generate positive, peer reviewed reviews by eye care professionals as to the performance and ease of use.

     ●    Penetrate the ophthalmologist and optometrist marketplace through our partner with our industry-changing DED diagnostic

           technology.

     ●    Identify potential strategic acquisition targets to accelerate our DED diagnostic applications and capabilities expansion.

     ●    Grow our DED business to reach a positive cash flow run rate by the end of 2024 and build its profitability beyond.

 

With our partnership with Versea, AXIM is now commercializing a healthcare solution that holds the potential to truly revolutionize the world. With the sales launch of AXIM’s diagnostic platform, AXIM is executing on our vision of penetrating a market where DED impacts over 350 million people worldwide. This strategy will enable our business to grow revenues and increase our earnings power to enhance shareholder value.

Milestones to Date

 

On August 03, 2021, we announced that the Company has signed a Binding Term Sheet to acquire the technology for the testing of Dry Eye Disease (DED), including two FDA clearances for the commercial sale of two ophthalmic diagnostic lab tests. The transaction closed on August 26, 2021.

 

On March 6, 2022, we announced that while the Company explores filing one or more EUA’s for point of care and/or at home use, it would begin to sell the Company’s neutralizing antibody (“Nab”) rapid test For Research Use Only (“RUO”) as it does not require FDA approval.

 

On March 8, 2022, we announced that we had successfully developed what we believe to be the first-ever rapid quantitative tear test for MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker for Dry Eye Disease. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an inflammatory biomarker consistently elevated in the tears of dry eye patients, may accelerate early diagnosis when detected. 

 

On April 27, 2022, we announced the successful development of a rapid quantitative tear test for Lacritin, a tear protein that autonomously promotes tearing and is deficient in all forms of Dry Eye Disease.

 

On May 10, 2022, we announced the development of a novel tear sample collector system and the filing of a provisional patent application for it with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that provides a more comfortable experience for patients and that facilitates the tear collection process.

 

On May 24, 2022, we announced that we had completed the optimization of a rapid diagnostics test for the quantitative measurement of Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE), a biomarker for ocular allergies. 

 

On June 2, 2022, we launched the Company’s new mobile-optimized website designed to provide doctors, researchers and other medical professionals with tailored, timely information and resources that will enable them to make informed decisions when purchasing AXIM’s proprietary diagnostic tests.

 

On July 12, 2022, we announced our publication in collaboration with researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) entitled, “Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose Boosts Neutralizing Antibodies in Poor Responders” in Communications Medicine, part of the Nature family of journals.

 

On July 21, 2022, we announced that Axim’s CEO John Huemoeller had been featured on the Vision is More Than 20/20™ podcast.

 

On July 26, 2022, we announced that we had developed an enhanced version of our rapid Ocular Immunoglobulin E (IgE) test in response to a study recently published in Nature that climate change is making allergy season occur sooner and for a longer period of time than in recent years.

 

On September 19, 2022, we signed an exclusive global commercial partnership agreement with Verséa Ophthalmics, LLC, a business division of Verséa Holdings, Inc.

AXIM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

 

AXIM has been developing a proprietary diagnostic platform that can be adapted to test for a variety of analytes including, for example, SARS-Cov-2, Lactoferrin, IgE, Lacritin, MMP-9. This innovative platform allows clinicians to detect with greater speed and accuracy different conditions that, as an example, allow for point of care testing of viruses, diseases, and conditions such as Dry Eye Disease. The platform capability can also be applied to rapid testing for vaccine candidates, including COVID vaccines and a potential Fentanyl vaccine. AXIM’s proprietary platform can also be used to enable point-of-care detection for one or more cancers using a unique cancer biomarker, QSOX1-L.

 

New Patent Allowances

 

AXIM was recently notified by the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) of three patent allowances. The first patent application relates to COVID and another for the neutralizing antibody (Nab) testing and treatment. The allowance confirms that AXIM was a pioneer in developing a rapid point of care Nab test and its novelty. Additionally, the company was notified by the USPTO of a second patent allowance for systems and methods for rapid diagnostic for various cancers. The invention relates to the discovery by AXIM scientists of a unique biomarker for cancer, QSOX1-L. A third patent allowance was received for a point-of-care apparatus and methods for detecting cancer that uniquely uses electrochemical or impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 

 

These allowances have increased the depth of AXIM’S IP portfolio to include 10 patent applications, including the 3 above allowed patents, that cover AXIM’s innovative platforms and technologies. The Company sees a significant value in its IP portfolio whereas it may look to either further develop the covered technologies or license the IP to larger healthcare organizations, both creating significant upside value for the organization. These allowances further validate both the novelty and underlaying science of AXIM’s diagnostic technologies.

 

Innovations in Diagnostics

 

While we continue to manufacture and ship our FDA-cleared diagnostic assays to customers through our commercialization partner, we have simultaneously continued to expand our value proposition through innovations in the diagnostics field, that are now protected under the USPTO. We see our growing IP portfolio as a major opportunity for the organization, with an unrealized market value which probably exceeds the company’s current market capitalization. For instance, while the original SAR COVID-19 virus which plagued the world in recent years received extensive attention from the medical community, our now protected assay methodology can be applied to any future mutations or new SARS viruses or vaccines. 

 

Following is an overview of AXIM’s patent portfolio:

 

SARS-Cov-2

 

Neutralizing Antibody Testing and Treatment. 1 Allowed Patent; 3 Utility Patent Applications.

 

The invention refers to a Rapid Test to measure levels of Neutralizing Antibodies to SARS-CoV2. Unlike currently available serological COVID-19 tests that detect an antibody response to the virus, the rapid 10-minute test measures a specific subpopulation of antibodies that block binding of the virus to host cell receptors. In contrast to current tests using live viruses which are time-consuming, expensive and require trained personnel in a tightly controlled laboratory setting to measure neutralizing antibodies, the rapid test is a portable, low cost, rapid point- of-care test that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies in 10 minutes.

 

 

                                                                   42



Table of Contents

 

The invention is a diagnostic test intended for semi-quantitative measurement of neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood of persons who have had recent or prior infection with SARS-CoV2 or have received a COVID-19 vaccine.

 

DRY EYE DISEASE

 

Tests for Human Monomeric Lacritin. 1 Utility Patent Application

 

The invention relates to a Rapid Point of Care test for Human Monomeric Lacritin. Lacritin is a tear protein that, in its monomeric form, autonomously promotes tearing and ocular surface survival. Lower concentrations of Lacritin may diagnose several eye diseases, including Blepharitis, Sjögren’s syndrome, Dry Eye Disease and other inflammatory conditions.

 

Tear Sample Collectors Systems and Methods. 1 Utility Patent Application

 

Tear fluid analysis contributes to the greater understanding of various ocular and systemic diseases and obtaining adequate samples for tear analysis requires effective collection methods. Most tear sample collectors on the market use capillary designs as tear sample collectors. These designs are intimidating to the patient when a sharp looking object is approaching the eye, are rather difficult to use by untrained personnel and are expensive to manufacture. Quidel InflammaDry is using a wick type tear sample collector that does not have any fill-up indicator and is rather intricate to produce on mass scale. Other prototype sample collectors employ Q-tip designs, filter paper strips (Schirmer’s test) are imprecise, some are difficult to produce en masse. The invention relates to a laminated and looped tear sample collector that addresses these and that is: 1) Cost-effective to produce on mass scale 2) Features a fill-up indicator (in case of laminated version) 3) Easy to use 4) Soft and non-intimidating to user and patient. 

 

PARKINSON’S DISEASE. 1 Provisional Patent Application 

 

The invention relates to a point-of-care, non-invasive diagnostic assay for the detection of abnormal alpha-synuclein, a known biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease (PD).  Evidence has shown that α-synuclein assays have the potential to differentiate people with PD from healthy controls, enabling the potential for early identification of at-risk groups. These findings suggest a crucial role for α-synuclein in therapeutic development, both in identifying pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and establishing biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

 

 CANCER DIAGNOSTICS

 

Systems and Methods for Rapid Diagnostic for Various Cancers. 1 Allowed Patent Application

 

QSOX1 (Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1) is an enzyme that is over-expressed in multiple tumor types. Genetically silencing QSOX1 in tumors has been shown to slow their growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. QSOX1-L, a splice variant of QSOX1, has been identified as a novel biomarker of bladder cancer and possibly other cancers in serum. Proprietary antibodies have been generated that selectively detect only this variant and not others. QSOX1-L has been used to develop a rapid and cost-effective diagnostic test for bladder and possibly other urologic cancers from urine.

 

DIAGNOSTIC METHODS AND TOOLS

 

Molecules and Related Assays, Test Kits and Methods. 1 Utility Patent Application, 1 Provisional Patent Application.

 

The invention relates to the use of various recombinant proteins, test kits, test kit components and methods for detecting and measuring “binding antibodies” (for example, non-neutralizing antibodies) as well as “functional antibodies” (for example, neutralizing) in a single test and at the same time. Such test kit and method can advantageously improve the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases.

 

 

                                                                   43

Use of Micromesh Materials in Diagnostic Devices. 1 Provisional Patent Application

 

When small sample sizes (0.1-2 microliters) are used, such as tears, there is a need for the sample to be spread out over the application area for a proper flow. The invention allows dispersion of a small sample volume over a wide area controllable by the mesh size. This enables homogeneous sample dispersion over the entire sample application area.

 

EIS TECHNOLOGY

 

Point of Care Apparatus and Methods for Detecting Cancer Using Electrochemical Impedance or Capacitance Spectroscopy (EIS). 1 Allowed Patent, 1 Utility Patent Application

 

These inventions relate to detection tools, diagnostics and related methods involving the use of an electrochemical sensor in conjunction with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy (EIS). Such detection tools may be utilized to detect cancer via biomarkers contained in bodily fluids. Many different analyte detection devices and systems exist. However, those that can be practically applied in a clinical, point of care or other setting requiring accuracy and reliability are fairly limited and tend to be complex and expensive.

 

V. TRADEMARKS

 

We have two trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Axim (Registration Date: May 19, 2015; and Axim Biotech (Registration Date: May 31, 2016). 

 

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods

 

Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. We plan to be an active player in the field of biosciences with our extensive R&D and pipeline of innovative products. Currently, our eye business focuses exclusively on ophthalmology and optometry, in the United States, where there are 37,000 optometrists and 19,000 ophthalmologists performing approximately 400,000 medical (dilated) eye exams per day.

 

Competition

 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.

 

We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.

 

While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for Covid-19 NAb product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.

 

The barrier for entrance into the dry eye space is difficult and requires extensive clinical studies, large capital expense and FDA 510(k) clearance. This process alone can take several years and substantial investment, with no certainty that the product will receive FDA 510(k) clearance. It is estimated that as of 2021, the total Company funding necessary to develop a Class II 510(k) cleared medical device is approximately $30 million. The development and engineering costs comprise approximately $2-5 million of this total. There are many factors that influence these costs, including the need for clinical studies, regulatory pathway and technology complexity.

 

 

                                                                   44



Table of Contents

 

We believe that we are well situated in the Eye Health sector with two 510(k) cleared tests. Additionally, the preferred clinical analysis is quantitative, giving us an advantage over the competition. Since our reader can interpret many different analytes other than Lf and IgE, it also opens the possibility of additional quantitative test development.

 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

 

In general there are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials that we use to manufacture our products and product candidates, and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by us.

 

We currently manufacture the majority of our testing materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. In the dry eye segment, we either make our reagents or they are sourced from select suppliers. We use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our assays and readers. 

 

Government Regulation

 

Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

 

Many, if not all of our customers, are covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of August 1996 or HIPAA. As part of the operation of our business, we provide reimbursement assistance to certain of our customers and as a result we act in the capacity of a business associate with respect to any patient-identifiable medical information, or PHI, we receive in connection with these services. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements related to the handling of patient information, including laws and regulations protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of PHI. The provisions of HIPAA require our customers to have business associate agreements with us under which we are required to appropriately safeguard the PHI we create or receive on their behalf. Further, we and our customers are required to comply with HIPAA security regulations that require us and them to implement certain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI, or EPHI. We are required by regulation and contract to protect the security of EPHI (electronic protected health information) that we create, receive, maintain or transmit for our customers consistent with these regulations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to reorganize processes and invest in new technologies. We also are required to train personnel regarding HIPAA requirements. If we, or any of our employees or consultants, are unable to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the PHI that is entrusted to us, we and/or our customers could be subject to civil and criminal fines and sanctions and we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and recent omnibus revisions to the HIPAA regulations, we are directly subject to HIPAA’s criminal and civil penalties for breaches of our privacy and security obligations and are required to comply with security breach notification requirements. The direct applicability of the HIPAA privacy and security provisions and compliance with the notification requirements requires us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations.

 

U.S. Government Regulation

 

Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of our product, which is a medical device. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, administrative fines or criminal prosecution.

 

 

                                                                   45



Table of Contents

 

Unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be commercially distributed in the United States until they have been registered, cleared or approved by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of the three classes, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Our tests have been assigned Moderate Complexity by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988). This law requires any facility performing examination of human specimens for diagnosis to be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services to be safe and effective. The assignment of Moderate Complexity to our tests requires laboratories or sites that perform our tests to have a CLIA certificate, to be inspected, and to meet the CLIA quality standards. 

 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, would require a new 510(k) clearance or an approval of a Premarket Approval, or PMA. A PMA is the FDA process of scientific or regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices which are those devices which support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Although the FDA requires the manufacturer to make the initial determination regarding the effect of a modification to the device that is subject to 510(k) clearance, the FDA can review the manufacturer’s determination at any time and require the manufacturer to seek another 510(k) clearance or an approval of a PMA. 

 

CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of in vitro diagnostic tests: (1) waived; (2) moderately complex; and (3) highly complex. The standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of diagnostic tests it performs. A CLIA waiver is available to clinical laboratory test systems if they meet certain requirements established by the statute. Waived tests are simple laboratory examinations and procedures employing methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results negligible or to pose no reasonable risk of harm to patients if the examinations or procedures are performed incorrectly. These tests are waived from regulatory oversight of the user other than the requirement to follow the manufacturer’s labeling and directions for use. We intend to file waiver applications with the FDA for the AXIM Eye System. 

 

Regardless of whether a medical device requires FDA clearance or approval, a number of other FDA requirements apply to the device, its manufacturer and those who distribute it. Device manufacturers must be registered and their products listed with the FDA, and certain adverse events and product malfunctions must be reported to the FDA. The FDA also regulates the product labeling, promotion and, in some cases, advertising of medical devices. In addition, manufacturers and their suppliers must comply with the FDA’s quality system regulation which establishes extensive requirements for quality and manufacturing procedures. Thus, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance, and failure to comply can lead to enforcement action. The FDA periodically inspects facilities to ascertain compliance with these and other requirements.

 

Environmental Matters

 

No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our current operations, and we do not anticipate that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Furthermore, compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

 

 

                                                                   46

The Company sold the securities referenced in this Item 1.01 in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

 

On February 10, 2022, the Company paid in full the remaining balance due on that certain convertible note issued to GS Capital Partners, LLC, face value $1,110,000 (as amended, the “GS Note”). In connection with the repayment, the Company was required to pay accrued interest in the amount of $21,875, by issuing 173,390 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the formula set forth in the GS Note.

 

In March 2022, the Company issued 624,290 of its shares of common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement for cash gross proceeds of $55,000. 

 

In January 2022 the company issued 7,000,000 of its shares in completion of its agreement with Advanced Tear Diagnostics regarding the acquisition of two 510(k) cleared medical devices.

 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 pandemic, as it was declared by the World Health Organization, has continued to spread and has already caused severe global disruptions. The extent of COVID-19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.

 

We expect COVID-19, along with the resulting government-imposed restrictions on businesses, to negatively impact our operations due to decreased consumer demand as well as potential production and warehouse limitations which results in an event or condition, before consideration of management’s plans, that could impact our ability to meet future obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and these cost reduction measures, as needed, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.

 

Sources of Capital

 

We expect to sustain our working capital needs through shareholder loans, private placements and/or registered offerings of our securities. Shareholder loans may be without stated terms of repayment or interest. We may consider taking on any long-term or short-term debt from financial institutions in the immediate future. Shareholders loans may be granted from time to time as required to meet current working capital needs. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time. 

 

During the next three months, we anticipate incurring costs related to:

 

     (i)  filing Exchange Act reports;

     (ii) contractual obligations;

     (iii)building inventory of our approved devices;

     (iii)clinical trials; and

     (iv) continued research and development of our diagnostic tests.

 

We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, we have limited cash. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.

 

 

                                                                   50

Known Trends or Uncertainties

 

We have seen some consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on us to date; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our financial results and business operations going forward.

 

The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.

 

As discussed in this Annual Report, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has negatively impacted our business in various ways over the last two years, including, more recently, as a result of global supply chain constraints at least partially attributable to the pandemic. Even now as the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term.

 

Inflation

 

Inflation has increased during the periods covered by this Annual Report, and is expected to continue to increase for the near future. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our products (and components thereof), interest rates, overhead costs and transportation costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise) due to supply chain constraints, consequences associated with COVID-19 and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, employee availability and wage increases, trade tariffs imposed on certain products from China and increased product pricing due to semiconductor product shortages.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

 

Going Concern

 

The Company’s financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital of $4,706,095 has an accumulated deficit of $72,477,157, has cash used in operating activities of $1,067,061 and presently does not have the resources to accomplish its objectives during the next three months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.

 

The Company may not be able to meet its contractual obligations to Arizona State University regarding past research; in addition, the Company may not be able to maintain its staff at current levels.

 

The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements and/or registered offerings of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.

Depreciation Expenses

 

For the three months ending March 31, 2024 our depreciation expenses were $9,396 as compared to $8,143 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the no purchase of purchase of fixed assets in current period.

Critical Accounting Policies

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

 

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

 

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ·    Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of the assets of the

           Company;

           

     ·    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with

           authorizations of management and directors of the Company;

           and

           

     ·    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

           Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

These limitations preclude the board and management from having absolute assurance of the achievement of the entity’s objectives. Even an effective control system provides reasonable but not absolute assurances. 

 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as updated as of 2017. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2023. Management, board of directors, and other personnel use judgment every day to select, develop, and deploy controls across the Company. Management, among other personnel apply judgement as they monitor and assess the effectiveness of the system of internal control. 

 

 

                                                                   54

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, wherein non-accelerated filers are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley internal control audit requirements.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

The Company has formal Compensation, Audit, Nominating and Governance Committees. Management and the Board established controls over financial reporting through policies and procedures that help ensure that management’s directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. Control activities are performed at all levels of the entity, at various levels within day-to-day procedures, and over technology environment. The Company’s control over financial reporting includes combination of preventive and detective controls and encompass a range of manual and automated activities such as authorizations and approvals, verifications, reconciliations, and business performance reviews.

 

Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls

 

Internal control provides reasonable assurance of achieving entity’s objectives, limitations do exist. Internal control cannot prevent bad judgment or decisions, or external events that can cause the Company to fail to achieve its operational goals. However, even an effective system of internal control can experience a failure. The limitations include, but not limited to: suitability of objectives established as a precondition to internal control; reality that human judgment in decision making can be faulty and subject to bias; breakdowns that can occur because of human failures such as simple errors; ability of management to override internal control; ability of management, other personnel, and/or third parties to circumvent controls through collusion; external events beyond the organization’s control. Notwithstanding these inherent limitations, management is aware of them when selecting, developing, and deploying controls that minimize, to the extent practical, these limitations. Segregation of duties is built into the selection and development of control activities. Where segregation of duties is not practical, management selects and develops alternative control activities. Ongoing evaluations are built into business process at different hierarchy levels of the Company and provide timely information. Findings are evaluated against criteria established by regulations, recognized standard-setting bodies or management and the board of directors, and deficiencies are communicated to management and the board of directors as appropriate.

Item 5. Other Information.

On July 14, 2022, the company entered into an equity purchase agreement with Cross & Co (Cross)Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, Cross has the right to “put,” or sell, up to $30,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock to Cross. Unless terminated earlier, Cross’ purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date on which Cross shall have purchased an aggregate of $30,000,000 shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement or July 14, 2025 We have no obligation to sell any shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement. This arrangement is also sometimes referred to herein as the “Equity Line.”

As provided in the Equity Purchase Agreement, we may require Cross to purchase shares of our common stock from time to time by delivering a put notice to Cross specifying the total number of shares to be purchased (such number of shares multiplied by the purchase price described below, the “Investment Amount”); provided there must be a minimum of ten trading days between delivery of each put notice. We may determine the Investment Amount, provided that such amount may not be more than 500% of the average daily trading volume in dollar amount for our common stock during the 5 trading days preceding the date on which we deliver the applicable put notice, unless waived by Cross in its sole discretion. Additionally, such amount may not be lower than $10,000 or higher than $1,000,000. Cross will have no obligation to purchase shares under the Equity Line to the extent that such purchase would cause Cross to own more than 4.99% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.

For each share of the our common stock purchased under the Equity Line, Cross will pay a purchase price equal to 87.5% of the “Market Price,” which is defined as the lowest closing traded price on the OTCQB Marketplace, as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P., during the five consecutive trading days including and immediately prior to the settlement date of the sale, which in most circumstances will be the trading day immediately following the “Put Date,” or the date that a put notice is delivered to Cross (the “Pricing Period”). On the settlement date, Cross will purchase the applicable number of shares, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, a requirement that a registration statement remain effective registering the resale by Cross of the shares to be issued under the Equity Line. The Equity Purchase Agreement is not transferable and any benefits attached thereto may not be assigned.

 

Compensation of Company Directors and Advisory Board Members

 

Our Directors are compensated $5,000 on a quarterly basis plus on each annual anniversary of Board service additional $20,000.

In such cases, we will compensate the directors for their services at rates no more favorable than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties.
