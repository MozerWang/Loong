Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements

March 31, 2024

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 – CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period ended March 31, 2024, and for all periods presented have been made.

 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s December 31, 2023, audited financial statements as reported in its Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended December 31, 2024.

 

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since inception, has negative cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management’s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies.

 

NOTE 3 – NOTES PAYABLE

 

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, notes payable were $242,290 and $242,290, respectively. The Company received $7,500 and $7,500 in note payable proceeds during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These loans are due on demand and bear interest at the rate of 8%. Interest expense on the loans for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, were $4,843 and $4,167, respectively, resulting in accrued interest of $124,720 and $119,877 at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

NOTE 4 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

The Company’s management reviewed all material events through the date of this filing and has determined that there are no material subsequent events to report. 

 

                                                                   8                                                                    

 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains these types of statements. Words such as “may,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” or “continue” or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Executive Overview

 

We have not recorded revenues from operations as of the date of this report and we have not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders or third parties to cover operating expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company.

 

The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur through a public offering.

 

Our management has not had any contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.

 

We anticipate that the Company will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.

 

We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.

 

                                                                   9                                                                    

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and we have relied primarily upon other parties to provide loans and pay for operating expenses. At March 31, 2024, we had cash of $13,725 compared to $17,225 at December 31, 2023. Our total liabilities increased to $379,561 at March 31, 2024, compared to $368,167 at December 31, 2023. The increase in liabilities primarily represents advances and services provided by third parties and accrued interest.

 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term.

 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans provided by management, significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.

 

Results of Operations

 

We did not record operating revenues in either 2024 or 2023. General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (“2024 three-month period”), was $10,051 compared to $5,700 the three months ended March 31, 2023 (“2023 three-month period”).

 

Total other expense increased to $4,843 for the 2024 three-month period, compared to $4,167 for the 2023 three-month period. Total other expense represents interest expense related to notes payable.

 

Our net loss increased to $14,894 for the 2024 three-month period, compared to $9,867 for the 2023 three-month period. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.

 

Commitments and Obligations

 

At March 31, 2024, we reported notes payable totaling $242,230 representing services received, as well as cash advances received from third parties. All of the notes payable are uncollateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand. Accrued interest related to these notes payable totaled $124,720 at March 31, 2024. No payments on principal or interest have been made to date.

 

A third-party consultant has provided professional services, paid for legal, accounting and administrative services on our behalf and/or provided advances to cover our operating costs. These accumulated services total $7,500 as of March 31, 2024, are not formally documented, have no repayment terms and thus we have recognized them as accounts payable.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

 

Emerging Growth Company

 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.

 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company.

 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   11
