Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

March 31, 2024

 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. The information furnished in the interim condensed financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. Although management believes the disclosures and information presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these interim condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its December 31, 2023, Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for year ending December 31, 2024.

 

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since inception, has negative cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management’s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies.

 

NOTE 3 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, a shareholder, invoiced the Company for consulting, administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided or paid on behalf of the Company totaling $1,500, resulting in the Company owing the shareholder $7,500 and $6,000 at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, a shareholder loaned the Company $0 by related parties. The notes bear interest at 8% and are due on demand. Notes payable – related party at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $164,125 and $164,125, respectively. Accrued interest at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $93,436 and $90,153, respectively.

 

NOTE 4 – Notes Payable

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company was loaned $0. The notes bear interest at 8% and are due on demand. Notes payable from non-related parties at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $130,275 and $130,275, respectively. Accrued interest at March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $77,602 and $74,996, respectively.

 

NOTE 5 – Subsequent Events

 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no such events that would have a material impact on the financial statements. 

 

                                                                   8                                                                    

 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as “may,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” or “continue” or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

 

In this report references to “Cancer Capital,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Cancer Capital Corp.

 

 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Executive Overview

 

We have not recorded revenues since inception, and we are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue.

 

As of the date of this report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. In addition, any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the Company.

 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.

 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares of our Common Stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their Common Stock.

 

                                                                   9                                                                    

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. We have relied primarily upon related parties and third parties to provide and pay for professional and operational expenses. At March 31, 2024, we had $12,657 cash and at December 31, 2023, we had $16,157. At March 31, 2024, total liabilities increased to $477,988, compared to $465,549 at December 31, 2023. Total liabilities primarily represent an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest for all notes payable and notes payable-related party for cash advances, consulting services and professional services provided by or paid for by a stockholder (See “Commitments and Obligations,” below).

 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term.

 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.

 

Results of Operations

 

We did not record operating revenues in either 2024 or 2023. General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (“2024 first quarter”) was $10,050 compared to $5,699 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (“2023 first quarter”).

 

Total other expense increased to $5,889 for the 2024 first quarter, compared to $5,709 for the 2023 first quarter. Total other expense represents interest expense related to notes payable and notes payable - related party.

 

Our net loss decreased to $15,939 for the 2024 first quarter, compared to $11,408 for the 2023 first quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.

 

Commitments and Obligations

 

At March 31, 2024, we reported notes payable totaling $130,275 with accrued interest of $77,602. We recorded notes payable - related party totaling $164,125 with accrued interest of $93,436. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, a shareholder invoiced the Company for consulting, administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided or paid on behalf of the Company totaling $1,500 resulting in the Company owing the shareholder $7,500 at March 31, 2024.

 

As of March 31, 2024, two lenders represent in excess of 95% of our accounts and notes payable.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

 

Emerging Growth Company

 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.

 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 

                                                                   10

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company.

 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   11
