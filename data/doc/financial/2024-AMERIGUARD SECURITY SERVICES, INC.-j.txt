FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

The statements contained in this report with respect to our financial condition, results of operations and business that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “seek”, “estimate”, “project”, “could”, “may” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. Management wishes to caution the reader of the forward-looking statements that any such statements that are contained in this report reflect our current beliefs with respect to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, economic, competitive, regulatory, technological, key employees, and general business factors affecting our operations, markets, growth, services, products, licenses and other factors, some of which are described in this report including in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and some of which are discussed in our other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are only estimates or predictions. No assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future results, as actual results may differ materially as a result of risks facing our company, and actual events may differ from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made regarding anticipated events.

 

These risk factors should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. All written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this report that are attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given these uncertainties, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

AmeriGuard Security Services, Inc. (AGS), was incorporated on November 14, 2002, with an S-Corp tax election. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 shares of no-par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO with 550 shares and Lillian Flores, VP of Operations with 450 shares. AGS provides armed guard services as a federal contractor with licenses in 5 states and provides commercial guard services in California.

 

On July 7, 2021, AGS, entered into an agreement to gain 100% control of Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc (HRAA) a public corporation, incorporated in Nevada, by the purchase of 10,000,000 shares of Preferred A-1 Stock from the seller, Custodian Ventures LLC. The purchase of HRAA allowed the Company to begin plans to consummate a reverse merger with HRAA, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of a public company. In March of 2022, a Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State, changing the name of HRAA, to Ameriguard Security Services, Inc. (AGSS). Shortly thereafter, a stock name and ticker change report was filed with the SEC and the stock ticker of HRAA was changed to AGSS.

 

On December 9, 2022, AGS executed the reverse merger agreement and became the subsidiary of AGSS (the Company). From that point forward, the financial statement filings will be the consolidation of Ameriguard Security Services, Inc, a Nevada company with Ameriguard Security Services, Inc. a California company.

 

On October 20, 2023, the Company executed a share purchase agreement to acquire TransportUS Inc. TransportUS, Inc. was incorporated on October 24, 2018, with an S-Corp tax election. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 shares with no-par par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO. TransportUS Inc. provides human transportation services as a federal contractor, currently providing services in the state of California.

 

The Company’s accounting year end is December 31.

 

Basis of Presentation

 

These consolidating financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements and notes include TransportUS Inc.’s financial results for 2022 and 2023.

 

Risks and Uncertainties

 

The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we are or may face in the future. If any of the following do occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

 

The company receives over 87% of its total revenue from five Federal contracts as described in Note 12 below. These contracts have specific terms, typically five years with the opportunity for extension, but there are no assurances they will be extended. Although we have had several extended in the past, there is no guarantee this will again happened in the future. However, there are significant direct expenses for each contract that also are removed from operations at the end of a contract. As a result, the revenue lost from a completed contract does not affect the bottom-line profits in an amount equal to the revenue lost. The actual net income impact depends on the contract.

 

The process required to acquire a government contract takes several months to complete prior to delivery of the proposal to the contracting agency. Due to the time span required to prepare a proposal and winning the contract is not guaranteed, the company maintains a department of individuals who monitor and write proposals for all government contracts that become open for bid on a continuing basis. It is important to the company that new contracts are acquired consistently to maintain and grow annual revenue.

 

Other risks to operations consist of State and Federal regulations, staffing shortages, accelerating inflation, and overall business environment issues we cannot foresee.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Use of Estimates

 

In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimated useful lives and potential impairment of property and equipment, along with the collectability of some receivables from customers.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. On March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,451,475 and $2,166,118 respectively.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and is charged to other bad debt expense. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our customers. With over eighty-seven percent of year end accounts receivable balance from Federal contracts that require payment, and the uncollectable amount historically has been less than 1%. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts was determined to be unnecessary.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations for the respective period. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. The Company uses other depreciation methods (generally accelerated) for tax purposes where appropriate. The estimated useful life for Machinery and Equipment, and Vehicles is 5 years, Leased vehicle capital expenditures are depreciated based on lease term generally 4 years, with Leasehold improvements useful life of 15 Years.

 

Operating Leases

 

In February 2016, FASB ASU No. 2016-02 established ASC Topic 842, Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. Effective December 31, 2022, we have implemented ASU No. 2016-02 and booked the operating lease asset and the related liability.

 

We have leased vehicles that are classified as operating leases per the guidelines. The capital lease value as calculated following FASB guidelines is presented as a non-current asset on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the value is calculated to be $1,005,633. For the Operating Lease liability, the amount of $1,060,015 was calculated as of December 31, 2023. Both the lease asset and liability are adjusted annually.

Net Income/(Loss) per Share

 

Net income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share”. Basic earnings/(loss) per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

We recognize revenue when the Invoice for contracted services is issued as stipulated by the contract. Other services provided are recognized at the time the service is provided. Ninety eight percent of revenues are billed monthly and recognized in the month the services were provided. Refunds and returns, which are minimal, are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company has not recorded a reserve for returns, since it does not believe such returns will be material.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company applies the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, as well as certain related FASB staff positions. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

 

The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:

 

     ●    Level 1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

           

     ●    Level 2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active

           markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are

           not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full

           term of the assets or

           liabilities.

           

     ●    Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value

           of the assets or

           liabilities.

 

The carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments approximates their fair value as of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024, due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

 

NOTE 3 – NOTE RECEIVABLE

 

On December 31, 2022, TransportUS held a receivable from a related company, AmeriGuard Security Systems, Inc (AmeriGuard) in the amount of $350,000. The relationship with AmeriGuard relates to the contract the Company holds with the Veteran’s Administration in Long Beach, California. The contract required this relationship with AmeriGuard, at the time of award. Funds from the contract were shared with AmeriGuard, during the first 3.5 years of operations which ended April 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the receivable was adjusted to $350,000 and a note payable from AmeriGuard was executed. The $350,000 note is amortized over 20 years, with a balloon payment December 31, 2032. The interest rate is 6%, with the monthly payment of $2,500. For March 31, 2024, the note receivable is presented with the current portion of $9,300, and long-term portion of $338,450, and a long-term portion of $340,700 for December 31, 2023.

NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY RECEIVABLE

 

On July 7, 2021, AGS entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the Preferred A-1 Stock of Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc. a SEC registered company for $500,000. In March 2022, Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc. name was changed to Ameriguard Security Services Inc. (AGSS). On December 9, 2022, we signed the definitive merger agreement initiating a reverse merger with AGSS, resulting in AGS becoming a 100% owned subsidiary of AGSS. Prior to the merger, AGS funded the operational expenses of AGSS and treated these expenses as related party expenses. These expenses were eliminated when the two companies were consolidated for the financial statement presentation.

 

The receivable balance on March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $57,971.

Corporate Structure

 

As previously mentioned, on December 9, 2022, AGSS executed a reverse merger with AmeriGuard resulting in AGSS becoming the sole owner of AmeriGuard. This merger establishes AGSS as a company operating a viable guard company with annual sales of approximately $24,000,000. On October 20, 2023, the Company executed a share purchase agreement to acquire TransportUS Inc. TransportUS, Inc. was incorporated on October 24, 2018, with an S-Corp tax election. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 shares with no-par par value stock held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO. TransportUS Inc. provides human transportation services as a federal contractor, currently providing services in the state of California. These two acquisitions within one year allows AGSS to access the capital market to generate the capital needed to continue its growth strategy of mergers and acquisitions within related industries.

 

AGSS continues developing the leadership team needed for success. We have in place a CEO with 20 years of experience in our industry who has experienced success in the government contracting market. Our new CFO has 20 years of experience in improving business performance as well as organizational growth across various sectors. Our Senior Controller has over 35 years of business finance experience, the last 15 of which he has been focusing on organizational development consulting across multiple industries, and an Operations team on the east coast managing IT and our federal contracts. We have an exclusive contract with Think Equity, a New York Investment Banking Firm, and we have engaged legal and SEC compliance professionals. We have a Board of Directors with Wall Street and government security experience, making us well positioned to aggressively grow the business.

Results of Operations for the three months ending March 31, 2024

 

Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold

 

The first quarter of 2024 experienced a 17.1% decrease of approximately $1,215,000 in overall revenue over the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was the net result of a federal guard contract that ended in May 2023 that provided approximately $1,800,000 in revenue each quarter, with an increase in revenue of approximately $550,000 from a federal transportation contract.

 

Despite the decline in revenue, AGSS experienced and increase in the gross profit margin due to the reduction of expenses, associated with the aforementioned contract that ended, along with increase transportation revenue without a significant increase in direct expenses. The results of the decline in revenue along with the reduction in direct expenses benefited AGSS by increasing the gross profit margin percentage from 7% to 13%.

 

Operating Expenses and Other Expense

 

Operation expenses increased in 2024 over 2023 by approximately $419,000. The majority of the increase, 88%, was the increase of approximately $370,000 in loan interest expense. Due to the tightening of capital markets during the previous 6 months, our efforts to acquire additional companies have been delayed. As a result, we have had to accept some less than desirable loan terms in order to support our operations at present. At the same time, we have been working diligently on finding more traditional financing to refinance our debt obligations. We anticipate receiving loan refinancing and an influx of capital before the end of the second quarter 2024.

 

The remaining increase of $50,000 in operating expenses is from a combination of increases and decreases in various expense categories. There was an increase in professional fees of approximately $90,000, an increase in advertising and marketing of approximately $19,000, an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $22,000, and an increase in the general and administrative expense group of approximately $52,000. The $183,000 of expense increases were offset by decreases of expenses in administrative salaries of $41,000, Staff training expenses of $63,000, and reduction of license fees for the live scan service of $18,500.

 

At this time, we believe that our operating structure and current level of expense can handle significantly more revenue with minor increases in our operating overhead expenses. This would allow the entire gross profit of any new contract or company acquisition to flow directly to our earnings, providing a consistent return on investment for our stockholders. Management is focused on reducing operating expenses wherever possible and actively seeking companies to acquire.

 

Net (Loss) from Operations

 

Net loss in the first quarter of 2024 was approximately $857,000, which is an increase over the loss in [the first quarter of] 2023 of approximately $688,000. As previously mentioned, our operational structure that drives these costs has excess capacity in anticipation of significant growth via new contracts, or more specifically, company acquisitions. This allows additional revenue to flow directly to our earnings.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The Company’s principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations and proceeds from debt financing. During the three months ending March 31, 2024, operations generated a net decrease in cash of approximately $611,000 while cash used by investing activities was approximately $263,000. Financing activities added approximately 160,600. The net decrease in cash for the period was approximately $714,000.

 

On March 31, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of $1,451,475 with total current assets of $3,169,533.

Moving Forward

 

Following the reverse merger in December 2022, we have been hard at work getting AGSS in the position it is in today. It has been difficult and expensive to get to this point of being a public company with the corporate structure, systems and team that can expand our business with increasing profitability. These costs have had a negative impact on our bottom line, yet we are now in position to execute our plans. Our current overhead expense structure has the capacity to manage multiple times the revenues from one of our two strategic sources. We remain confident and expect that our future will be profitable.

 

Our first source is to continue down our historical path of seeking out contracts that meet our sweet spot and bidding with the expectation of successful results. In early February 2024, TransportUS Inc was awarded a new contract from the Department of Veterans Affairs providing transportation for veterans in central LA. TransportUS Inc currently has proposals with two other cities for similar services. Ameriguard Security Services Inc has proposals out for guard services as well.

 

Our second source of growth is mergers and acquisitions. Now that we have access to capital markets and we operate in both the guard industry and the non-emergency medical transportation industry, we believe that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. The total available market for the security industry continues to grow, and at the same time, there is significant consolidation occurring. As a top-tier company in the industry, we can be a desired company for acquisition exits and quickly triple our revenues with one or two key acquisitions. After such acquisitions, we could see the additional gross profits from acquired companies flow directly to our earnings. Such returns may be quick and significant. The non-emergency medical transportation industry continues to expand and the opportunity for gaining contracts is increasing. At the same time, our intention is to find additional transportation companies to acquire.

 

There are also acquisition opportunities in several other industries that fit our business model. Those include cyber security, private security, ammunition manufacturing, and surveillance to mention a few.

 

The Company continues the process of our first equity raise to recover our expended working capital and acquire additional companies. We anticipate the equity raise to be completed in the next quarter.

 

Management is very positive regarding profitable operations for the next twelve months based on the following:

 

     ●    AGSS operates in growing industries.

 

     ●    The security industry continues to expand, and we are now a part of the expanding transportation industry as well

 

     ●    There are over 8,000 security companies operating in our market, with 50% available for acquisition.

 

     ●    Our management team, Board of Directors and supporting equity professionals can get the job done.

 

     ●    We have been and will continue to be a company that is very conservative with our resources and will use every possible

           dollar to provide strength and good return to our

           investors.

 

     ●    We are in it for the long haul.

 

     ●    We make profits the old fashion way, hard work.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the information required by this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to satisfy the objectives for which they are intended due to a weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.

 

The framework our management uses to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is based on the guidance provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in its 1992 report: INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of March 31, 2024, due to the same weaknesses that rendered our disclosure controls and procedures ineffective. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to a lack of sufficient resources to hire support staff to separate duties between different individuals. The Company plans to address these weaknesses as resources become available by hiring additional professional staff, as funding becomes available, outsourcing certain aspects of the recording and reporting functions, and separating responsibilities. We have identified the following material weakness.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.

 

Because of these weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in “INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK” issued by the COSO. Management believes that the weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results because the activity during this period was nominal. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. Management will further recruit qualified individuals, establish an audit committee, and ensure that board members have current and pertinent financial experience.

 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

A lawsuit has been filed in Fresno County Superior Court, but it is early in the process and we cannot comment on the merits at this time. The Company believes the suit has no merit and intends to resolve it before a trial, if possible. As of March 31, 2024, there have been no additional litigation issues, nor changes in those in process.
