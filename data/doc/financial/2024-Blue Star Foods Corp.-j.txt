CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “estimates”, “plans” and words of similar import. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

 

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, potential target businesses, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore that you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as statements of historical fact or as guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include changes in local, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market (supply and demand), regulatory conditions and the following:

 

     ●    Our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms and conditions;

           

     ●    Our ability to make acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses into our company;

           

     ●    Our ability to attract and retain management with experience in the business of importing, packaging and selling of seafood;

           

     ●    Our ability to negotiate, finalize and maintain economically feasible agreements with suppliers and customers;

           

     ●    The availability of crab meat and other premium seafood products we sell;

           

     ●    The intensity of competition; and

           

     ●    Changes in the political and regulatory environment and in business and fiscal conditions in the United States and overseas.

 

A description of these and other risks and uncertainties that could affect our business appears in the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. The risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive.

 

Given these uncertainties, readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Note 1. Company Overview

 

Blue Star Foods Corp., a Delaware corporation (“we”, “our”, the “Company”), is an international sustainable marine protein company based in Miami, Florida that imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat, and other premium seafood products. The Company’s main operating business, John Keeler & Co., Inc. (“Keeler & Co.”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in May 1995. The Company has three other subsidiaries, Coastal Pride, TOBC and AFVFL which maintain the Company’s fresh crab meat, steelhead salmon and packaged seafood and other inventory businesses, respectively. The Company’s current source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia, Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States and Canada under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go, First Choice, Good Stuff and Coastal Pride Fresh, steelhead salmon and rainbow trout produced under the brand name Little Cedar Farms for distribution in Canada and purchasing raw materials for packaged seafood and other inventory under AFVFL to be sold to various customers in the United States.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The following unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, such interim financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for complete annual financial statements. The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the Company’s annual financial statements that were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm but does not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete annual financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 for a broader discussion of our business and the risks inherent in such business.

 

Advances to Suppliers and Related Party 

 

In the normal course of business, the Company may advance payments to its suppliers, including of Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (“Bacolod”), a related party based in the Philippines. These advances are in the form of prepayments for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes necessary for the Company to return products or adjust for quality issues, the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the normal course of business and these credits are also reflected against future shipments.

 

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the balance due from the related party for future shipments was approximately $1,300,000. No new purchases have been made from Bacolod since November 2020. There was no cost of revenue related to inventories purchased from Bacolod recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as such, we record revenue when our customer obtains control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States and Canada under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go, First Choice, Good Stuff and Coastal Pride Fresh, steelhead salmon and rainbow trout fingerlings produced by TOBC under the brand name Little Cedar Farms for distribution in Canada and purchasing raw materials for packaged seafood and other inventory under AFVFL. The Company sells primarily to food service distributors. The Company also sells its products to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.

 

                                                                   9



 

 

To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer by receipt of purchase orders and confirmations sent by the Company which includes a required line of credit approval process, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract which includes shipment of goods to the customer FOB shipping point or destination, (3) determine the transaction price which initiates with the purchase order received from the customer and confirmation sent by the Company and will include discounts and allowances by customer if any, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract which is the shipment of the goods to the customer and transaction price determined in step 3 above and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation which is when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customers by shipment or delivery of the products.

 

The Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement’s transaction price, thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized, unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable consist of unsecured obligations due from customers under normal trade terms, usually net 30 days. The Company grants credit to its customers based on the Company’s evaluation of a particular customer’s credit worthiness.

 

Allowances for credit losses are maintained for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of the Company’s periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. Receivables are written off as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been deemed to be unsuccessful. Subsequent recoveries are netted against the allowance for credit losses. The Company generally does not charge interest on receivables.

 

Receivables are net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return, allowances and discounts. They are stated at estimated net realizable value. As of March 31, 2024, the Company recorded allowances for sales returns, allowances and discounts of $34,968 and refund liability of $178,874. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an allowance for bad debt of approximately $4,000. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded sales return, allowances and discounts of $31,064 and refund liability of $189,975. There was no allowance for bad debt recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Inventories

 

Substantially all of the Company’s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at a public cold storage facility and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The Company also has eggs and fish in process inventory from TOBC and raw materials for packaged seafood and other inventory from AFVFL. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using the specific identification method for crab meat and raw materials for packaged seafood inventory. Fish in process inventory is measured based on the estimated biomass of fish on hand. The Company has established a standard procedure to estimate the biomass of fish on hand using counting and sampling techniques. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method for crab meat and raw materials for packaged seafood inventory and using various estimates and assumptions in regard to the calculation of the biomass, including expected yield, market value of the biomass, and estimated costs of completion.

 

Merchandise is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company’s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers’ warehouse.

 

                                                                   10



 

 

The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value based on its assessment of market conditions, inventory turnover and current stock levels. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an inventory allowance of $336,049. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an inventory allowance in the amount of $176,000 which was charged to cost of goods sold.

 

The Company’s inventory as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists of:

Lease Accounting

 

The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases, which requires all leases to be reported on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease obligations. The Company elected the practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that retained the lease classification and initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption of the standard.

 

The Company categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that would allow the Company to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. The Company did not have any finance leases as of March 31, 2024. The Company’s leases generally have terms that range from three years for equipment and six to seven years for real property. The Company elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease components of its agreements as a single component and accounts for them as a lease.

 

Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the lease. Lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.

 

When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.

 

                                                                   11

Management reviews long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life on an undiscounted basis. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured using fair value. Fair value estimates are completed using a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses for assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. No impairment was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Risk

 

The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through its normal operating activities. Its primary focus is to monitor exposure to, and manage, the economic foreign currency exchange risks faced by, its operations and realized when the Company exchanges one currency for another. The Company’s operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar as its functional currencies. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect its financial statements.

 

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments

 

Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs in one of the following three categories:

 

Level 1 measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Valuation of these items does not entail a significant amount of judgment.

 

Level 2 measurements are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities.

 

Level 3 measurements are based on unobservable data that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

 

Our financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, debt obligations, derivative liabilities and warrant liabilities. We believe the carrying values of our cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable on demand. The derivative liability is the embedded conversion feature on the 2023 Lind convertible note. All derivatives and warrant liabilities are recorded at fair value. The change in fair value for derivatives and warrants liabilities is recognized in earnings. The Company’s derivative and warrant liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the Black Scholes Pricing model as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were no financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis under Levels 1 and 2.

The fair market value of all derivatives and warrant liability as of March 31, 2024 was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

There are various updates recently issued to the accounting literature and these are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Note 3. Going Concern

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,093,095, had an accumulated deficit of $34,903,827 and a working capital surplus of $869,797, inclusive of $86,038 in stockholder debt. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to increase revenues, execute on its business plan to acquire complimentary companies, raise capital, and to continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability and cash flows would be detrimental to the Company. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 

                                                                   14



 

 

Note 4. Other Current Assets

 

Other current assets totaled $1,326,011 as of March 31, 2024 and $833,472 as of December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $404,000, $158,000 and $390,000 of the balance was related to prepaid inventory to the Company’s suppliers, prepaid legal fees and receivables for shares issuance per the securities purchase agreement with ClearThink, respectively. The remainder of the balance was related to prepaid insurance and other prepaid expenses.

Note 6. Debt

 

Working Capital Line of Credit

 

On March 31, 2021, Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride entered into a loan and security agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Lighthouse Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation (“Lighthouse”). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Lighthouse made available to Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride (together, the “Borrowers”) a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit for a term of thirty-six months, renewable annually for one-year periods thereafter. Amounts due under the line of credit are represented by a revolving credit note issued to Lighthouse by the Borrowers.

 

The advance rate of the revolving line of credit is 85% with respect to eligible accounts receivable and the lower of 60% of the Borrowers’ eligible inventory, or 80% of the net orderly liquidation value, subject to an inventory sublimit of $2,500,000. The inventory portion of the loan will never exceed 50% of the outstanding balance. Interest on the line of credit is the prime rate (with a floor of 3.25%), plus 3.75% which increased to 4.75% in 2022. The Borrowers paid Lighthouse a facility fee of $50,000 in three instalments of $16,667 in March, April and May 2021 and paid an additional facility fee of $25,000 on each anniversary of March 31, 2021. On January 14, 2022, the maximum inventory advance under the line of credit was adjusted from 50% to 70% until June 30, 2022, 65% to July 31, 2022, 60% to August 31, 2022 and 55% to September 30, 2022 at a monthly fee of 0.25% on the portion of the loan in excess of the 50% advance in order to increase imports to meet customer demand.

 

The line of credit was secured by a first priority security interest on all the assets of each Borrower. Pursuant to the terms of a guaranty agreement, the Company guaranteed the obligations of the Borrowers under the note and John Keeler, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, provided a personal guaranty of up to $1,000,000 to Lighthouse. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash proceeds from the working capital line of credit totaled $1,165,765 and cash payments to the working capital line of credit totaled $1,454,193.

 

On June 16, 2023, the Company terminated the Loan Agreement and paid a total of approximately $108,400 to Lighthouse which included, as of June 16, 2023, an outstanding principal balance of approximately $93,400, accrued interest of approximately $9,900, and other fees incurred in connection with the line of credit of approximately $4,900. Upon the repayment of the total outstanding indebtedness owing to Lighthouse, the Loan Agreement and all other related financing agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Loan Agreement were deemed terminated.

 

                                                                   15

Lind Global Fund II LP notes

 

2022 Note

 

On January 24, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind Global Fund II LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Lind”), pursuant to which the Company issued Lind a secured, two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $5,750,000 (the “2022 Lind Note) and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments (50,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $90 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split). The warrant provides for cashless exercise and for full ratchet anti-dilution if the Company issues securities at less than $4.50 per share (exercise price of $90 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split). In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Lind Note and the warrant, the Company paid a $150,000 commitment fee to Lind and $87,144 of debt issuance costs. The Company recorded a total of $2,022,397 debt discount at issuance of the debt, including original issuance discount of $750,000, commitment fee of $150,000, $87,144 debt issuance cost, and $1,035,253 related to the fair value of warrants issued. Amortization expense recorded in interest expense totaled $0 and $273,614 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

The outstanding principal under the 2022 Lind Note was payable commencing July 24, 2022, in 18 consecutive monthly installments of $333,333, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of common stock at a price (the “Repayment Share Price”) based on 90% of the five lowest volume weighted average prices (“VWAP”) during the 20-days prior to the payment date with a floor price of $1.50 per share (the “Floor Price”) (floor price of $30 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split), or a combination of cash and stock provided that if at any time the Repayment Share Price is deemed to be the Floor Price, then in addition to shares, the Company would pay Lind an additional amount in cash as determined pursuant to a formula contained in the 2022 Lind Note.

 

                                                                   16



 

 

In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Lind Note, the Company granted Lind a first priority security interest and lien on all of its assets, including a pledge of its shares in Keeler & Co., pursuant to a security agreement and a stock pledge agreement with Lind, dated January 24, 2022 (the “2022 Security Agreement). Each subsidiary of the Company also granted a second priority security interest in all of its respective assets.

 

The 2022 Lind Note was mandatorily payable prior to maturity if the Company issued any preferred stock (with certain exceptions described in the note) or, if the Company or its subsidiaries issued any debt. The Company also agreed not to issue or sell any securities with a conversion, exercise or other price based on a discount to the trading prices of the Company’s stock or to grant the right to receive additional securities based on future transactions of the Company on terms more favorable than those granted to Lind, with certain exceptions.

 

If the Company failed to maintain the listing and trading of its common stock, the note would become due and payable and Lind may convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal at the lower of the then current conversion price and 80% of the average of the 3-day VWAP during the 20 days prior to delivery of the conversion notice.

 

If the Company engaged in capital raising transactions, Lind had the right to purchase up to 10% of the new securities.

 

The 2022 Lind Note was convertible into common stock at $5.00 per share ($100 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split), subject to certain adjustments, on April 22, 2022; provided that no such conversion may be made that would result in beneficial ownership by Lind and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. If shares are issued by the Company at less than the conversion price, the conversion price will be reduced to such price.

 

Upon a change of control of the Company, as defined in the 2022 Lind Note, Lind had the right to require the Company to prepay 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Lind Note. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal amount of the note, provided Lind may convert up to 25% of the principal amount of the 2022 Lind Note at a price per share equal to the lesser of the Repayment Share Price or the conversion price. The 2022 Lind Note contained certain negative covenants, including restricting the Company from certain distributions, stock repurchases, borrowing, sale of assets, loans and exchange offers.

 

Upon an event of default as described in the 2022 Lind Note, the 2022 Lind Note would become immediately due and payable at a default interest rate of 125% of the then outstanding principal amount. Upon a default, all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount may be converted into shares of common stock by Lind at the lower of the conversion price and 80% of the average of the three lowest daily VWAPs.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made aggregate principal payments on the 2022 Lind Note of $2,075,900 through the issuance of an aggregate of 1,379,212 shares of common stock, including a principal payment of $1,094,800 through the issuance of an aggregate of 373,532 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the Company paid $2,573,142 to Lind and the 2022 Lind Note was extinguished.

 

2023 Note

 

On May 30, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lind pursuant to which the Company issued to Lind a secured, two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1,200,000 (the “2023 Lind Note”) and a warrant (the “Lind Warrant”) to purchase 435,035 shares of common stock of the Company commencing six months after issuance and exercisable for five years at an exercise price of $2.45 per share. The Lind Warrant includes cashless exercise and full ratchet anti-dilution provisions. In connection with the issuance of the Lind Note and the Lind Warrant, the Company paid Lind a $50,000 commitment fee. The proceeds from the sale of the Note and Warrant are for general working capital purposes.

 

In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Lind Note, the Company and Lind amended the 2022 Security Agreement to include the new 2023 Lind Note, pursuant to an amended and restated security agreement, dated May 30, 2023, between the Company and Lind.

 

The Company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the 2023 Lind Note and Lind Warrant. Lind was also granted piggyback registration rights.

 

                                                                   17



 

 

If the Company engages in capital raising transactions, Lind has the right to purchase up to 20% of the new securities for 24 months.

 

The 2023 Lind Note is convertible into common stock of the Company after the earlier of 90 days from issuance or the date the registration statement is effective, provided that no such conversion may be made that would result in beneficial ownership by Lind and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. The conversion price of the 2023 Lind Note is equal to the lesser of: (i) $2.40; or (ii) 90% of the lowest single volume-weighted average price during the twenty-trading day period ending on the last trading day immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, subject to customary adjustments. The maximum number of shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the conversion of the 2023 Lind Note and the exercise of the Lind Warrant, in the aggregate, will not, exceed 19.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company immediately prior to the date of the 2023 Lind Note, in accordance with NASDAQ rules and guidance. Due to the variable conversion price of the 2023 Lind Note, the embedded conversion feature was accounted as a derivative liability. The fair value of the derivative liability at issuance amounting to $264,687 was recorded as debt discount and amortized over the term of the note.

 

The 2023 Lind Note contains certain negative covenants, including restricting the Company from certain distributions, stock repurchases, borrowing, sale of assets, loans and exchange offers.

 

Upon the occurrence of an event of default as described in the 2023 Lind Note, the 2023 Lind Note will become immediately due and payable at a default interest rate of 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Lind Note.

 

The Warrant entitles the Investor to purchase up to 435,035 shares of common stock of the Company during the exercise period commencing on the date that is six months after the issue date (“Exercise Period Commencement”) and ending on the date that is sixty months from the Exercise Period Commencement at an exercise price of $2.45 per share, subject to customary adjustments. The Warrant includes cashless exercise and full ratchet anti-dilution provisions.

 

On July 27, 2023, the Company, entered into a First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement Amendment”) with Lind, which provided for the issuance of further senior convertible promissory notes up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,800,000 and the issuance of additional warrants in such amounts as the Company and Lind shall mutually agree.

 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement Amendment, the Company issued to Lind a two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $300,000 and a warrant to purchase 175,234 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.34 per share for $250,000.

Results of Operations 

 

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial statements and accompanying notes elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

 

Three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

Net Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased 19.1% to $2,260,329 as compared to $1,898,439 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as a result of an increase in poundage and new packaged seafood inventory sold during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased to $2,089,567 as compared to $1,614,077 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is attributable to the increase in poundage and new packaged seafood inventory sold in the cost of goods and increases in inventory reserves.

 

Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased to $170,762 as compared to gross profit of $284,362 in the three months March 31, 2023. This decrease is attributable to the increase in inventory reserves for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Commissions Expense. Commissions expense increased to $4,221 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $973 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase was due to higher commissionable revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Salaries and Wages Expense. Salaries and wages expense decreased to $301,790 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $530,838 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is mainly attributable to a strategic reduction in salaries for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $1,299 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $2,669 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is attributable to lower depreciation due to the impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022.

 

Other Operating Expense. Other operating expense increased to $705,651 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $700,090 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly attributable to legal and professional fees related to our business operations.

 

Other Income. Other income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 to $1,535 from $1,902 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is mainly attributable to the collections by Coastal Pride of receivables existing prior to the acquisition of Coastal Pride by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and no such collection in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Change in Fair Value of Derivatives and Warrants Liabilities. Change in fair value of derivatives and warrants liabilities increased to $82,636 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is attributable to the 2023 Lind notes embedded conversion feature due to the variable conversion price on the promissory notes.

 

Loss on Settlement of Debt. Loss on settlement of debt decreased to $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $648,430 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

 

Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $335,067 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $354,666 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is attributable to the lower amortization of the Lind convertible debt discounts.

 

Net Loss. Net loss was $1,093,095 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $1,951,402 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributable to the decrease of salaries and wages, interest expense and loss on settlement of debt.

 

                                                                   26



 

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

The Company had cash of $22,298 as of March 31, 2024. At March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital surplus of $869,797, including $86,038 in stockholder loans, and the Company’s primary sources of liquidity consisted of inventory of $2,280,480 and accounts receivable of $910,815.

 

The Company has historically financed its operations through the cash flow generated from operations, capital investment, notes payable and a working capital line of credit.

 

Cash (Used in) Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $679,928 as compared to cash used in operating activities of $1,406,778 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to decrease in inventory of $1,126,542 and decrease in payables of $1,623,191, offset by the increase in other current assets of $148,813 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Cash (Used in) Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $23,146 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $15,351 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the purchase of fixed assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the purchases of fixed assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $622,626 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,515,941 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is mainly attributable due to the increased repayments of short-term loans and less proceeds from common stock offering during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Working Capital Line of Credit

 

On March 31, 2021, Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride entered into a loan and security agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with Lighthouse Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation (“Lighthouse”). Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Lighthouse made available to Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride (together, the “Borrowers”) a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit for a term of thirty-six months, renewable annually for one-year periods thereafter. Amounts due under the line of credit were represented by a revolving credit note issued to Lighthouse by the Borrowers.

 

The advance rate of the revolving line of credit was 85% with respect to eligible accounts receivable and the lower of 60% of the Borrowers’ eligible inventory, or 80% of the net orderly liquidation value, subject to an inventory sublimit of $2,500,000. Interest on the line of credit was the prime rate (with a floor of 3.25%), plus 3.75%. The Borrowers paid Lighthouse a facility fee of $50,000 in three instalments of $16,667 in March, April and May 2021 and paid an additional facility fee of $25,000 on each anniversary of March 31, 2021. On January 14, 2022, the maximum inventory advance under the line of credit was adjusted from 50% to 70% until June 30, 2022, 65% to July 31, 2022, 60% to August 31, 2022 and 55% to September 30, 2022 at a monthly fee of 0.25% on the portion of the loan in excess of the 50% advance in order to increase imports to meet customer demand. On July 29, 2022, the Loan Agreement was further amended to set the annual interest rate on the outstanding principal amount at 4.75% above the prime rate and to reduce the monthly required cash flow requirements beginning July 31, 2022. The amendment also updated the maximum inventory advance under the line of credit to 60% from August 31, 2022 through September 29, 2022 and 50% from September 30, 2022 and thereafter.

 

The line of credit was secured by a first priority security interest on all the assets of each Borrower. Pursuant to the terms of a guaranty agreement, the Company guaranteed the obligations of the Borrowers under the note and John Keeler, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, provided a personal guaranty of up to $1,000,000 to Lighthouse.

 

On June 16, 2023, the Company terminated the Loan Agreement and paid a total of approximately $108,400 to Lighthouse which included, as of June 16, 2023, an outstanding principal balance of approximately $93,400, accrued interest of approximately $9,900, and other fees incurred in connection with the line of credit of approximately $4,991. Upon the repayment of the total outstanding indebtedness owing to Lighthouse, the Loan Agreement and all other related financing agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Loan Agreement were deemed terminated.

 

                                                                   27



 

 

John Keeler Promissory Notes

 

From January 2006 through May 2017, Keeler & Co issued 6% demand promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,910,000 to John Keeler, our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $86,038 of principal remains outstanding and approximately $2,400 of interest was paid under the notes during the three months ended March 31, 2024. After satisfaction of the terms of the subordination, the Company may prepay the notes at any time first against interest due thereunder. If an event of default occurs under the notes, interest will accrue at 18% per annum and if not paid within ten days of payment becoming due, the holder of the note is entitled to a late fee of 5% of the amount of payment not timely made. The Company made principal payments of $79,582 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company made no principal payments during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Lind Global Fund II LP notes

 

On January 24, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lind pursuant to which the Company issued Lind a secured, two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $5,750,000 and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments (50,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $90 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split). The warrant provides for cashless exercise and for full ratchet anti-dilution if the Company issues securities at less than $4.50 per share. In connection with the issuance of the note and the warrant, the Company paid a $150,000 commitment fee to Lind and approximately $87,000 of debt issuance costs.

 

The outstanding principal under the note was payable commencing July 24, 2022, in 18 consecutive monthly installments of $333,333, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of common stock at a price (the “Repayment Share Price”) based on 90% of the five lowest volume weighted average prices (“VWAP”) during the 20-days prior to the payment date with a floor price of $1.50 per share (the “Floor Price”), floor price of $30 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split, or a combination of cash and stock provided that if at any time the Repayment Share Price is deemed to be the Floor Price, then in addition to shares, the Company will pay Lind an additional amount in cash as determined pursuant to a formula contained in the note.

 

In connection with the issuance of the note, the Company granted Lind a first priority security interest and lien on all of its assets, including a pledge on its shares in John Keeler & Co. Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a security agreement and a stock pledge agreement with Lind, dated January 24, 2022. Each subsidiary of the Company also granted a second priority security interest in all of its respective assets.

 

The note was mandatorily payable prior to maturity if the Company issued any preferred stock (with certain exceptions described in the note) or, if the Company or its subsidiaries issued any indebtedness. The Company also agreed not to issue or sell any securities with a conversion, exercise or other price based on a discount to the trading prices of the Company’s stock or to grant the right to receive additional securities based on future transactions of the Company on terms more favorable than those granted to Lind, with certain exceptions.

 

If the Company failed to maintain the listing and trading of its common stock, the note would become due and payable and Lind may convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal at the lower of the then current conversion price and 80% of the average of the 3-day VWAP during the 20 days prior to delivery of the conversion notice.

 

If the Company engages in capital raising transactions, Lind has the right to purchase up to 10% of the new securities.

 

The note was convertible into common stock at $5.00 per share ($100 per share after taking into account the Company’s Reverse Stock Split), subject to certain adjustments, at any time after the earlier of six months from issuance or the date the registration statement is effective; provided that no such conversion may be made that would result in beneficial ownership by Lind and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. If shares were issued by the Company at less than the conversion price, the conversion price will be reduced to such price.

 

                                                                   28

The Lind Warrant includes cashless exercise and full ratchet anti-dilution provisions. In connection with the issuance of the Lind Note and the Lind Warrant, the Company paid Lind a $50,000 commitment fee.

On September 11, 2023, the Company offered and sold in a “best efforts” public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 7, 2023, an aggregate of 690,000 shares of common stock, together with Series A-1 warrants to purchase up to 10,741,139 shares of common stock and Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 10,741,139 shares of common stock (collectively, the “Common Warrants”) and 10,051,130 pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”).

 

Each share of common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants were sold together with a Series A-1 common stock purchase warrant to purchase one share of common stock and a Series A-2 common stock purchase warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The shares of common stock or Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrants are immediately separable and were issued separately. The public offering price for each share of common stock and accompanying Common Warrants was $0.4655. Each Common Warrant has an exercise price per share of $0.4655 and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the Common Warrants (“Warrant Stockholder Approval”). The Series A-1 common stock purchase warrants will expire on the five-year anniversary of the effective date of the Warrant Stockholder Approval. The Series A-2 common stock purchase warrants will expire on the eighteen-month anniversary of the effective date of the Warrant Stockholder Approval. The Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable immediately, may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full, and have an exercise price of $0.01. The Warrant Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained.

 

The shares of common stock, Common Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants were sold pursuant to a securities purchase agreement. H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC acted as placement agent for the offering and received a fee of 7% of the gross proceeds, reimbursement of $35,000 in non-accountable expenses and $100,000 for legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses.

 

2021 Underwritten Offering 

 

On November 2, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Newbridge Securities Corporation (“Newbridge”), as representative of the underwriters listed therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters in a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) an aggregate of 800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, at a public offering price of $5.00 per share. In addition, the Underwriters were granted an over-allotment option (the “Over-allotment Option”) for a period of 45 days to purchase up to an additional 120,000 shares of common stock. The Offering closed on November 5, 2021 and the common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “BSFC” on November 3, 2021. The Over-allotment Option was not exercised by the Underwriters.

 

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount, the underwriters’ fees and expenses and the Company’s estimated Offering expenses, were approximately $3,600,000. The Company used the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or make investments in businesses, products, and offerings, although the Company does not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at this time.

 

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and related “lock-up” agreements, each director, executive officer, and beneficial owners of over 10% of the Company’s common stock (for a period of 180 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Offering), have agreed, subject to customary exceptions, not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of securities of the Company, without the prior written consent of Newbridge.

 

On November 5, 2021, in connection with the November 2, 2021 Offering, the Company issued a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 2,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $100.00 per share to Newbridge. Such warrant expires on November 11, 2024.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of March 31, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that based on the material weaknesses discussed below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were:

 

● inadequate control over the monitoring of inventory maintained in the Company’s third-party warehouse;

 

● ineffective controls over the Company’s financial close and reporting process; and

 

● inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, including lack of personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function of the Company.

 

Management believes that the material weaknesses that were identified did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that these weaknesses, if not properly remediated, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.

 

Management’s Remediation Initiatives

 

In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to further initiate, the following measures, subject to the availability of required resources:

 

● We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and hire personnel resources with technical accounting expertise within the accounting function; and

 

● We plan to create an internal control framework that will address financial close and reporting process, among other procedures.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

During the period covered by this Quarterly Report, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
