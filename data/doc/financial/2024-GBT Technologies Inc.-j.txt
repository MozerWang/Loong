GBT Technologies, Inc.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation

 

Organization and Line of Business

 

GBT Technologies Inc. (the “Company”, “GBT”, or “GTCH”) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is targeting growing markets such as development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking and tracking technologies, including wireless mesh network technology platform and fixed solutions, development of an intelligent human body vitals device, asset-tracking IoT, and wireless mesh networks.

On February 18, 2022 the Company, effective March 1, 2022 entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement (“RSA”) with Mahaser LTD. (“Mahaser”) pursuant to which the Company shares revenues generated by Mahaser with respect to e-commerce sales through the online retail platform in the United States of America. Effective July 1, 2023, the Company agreed to terminate the RSA with Mahaser Ltd.

 

On July 20, 2023, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, Greenwich International Holdings, a Costa Rica corporation (“Greenwich”), entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture (the “2023 Tokenize Agreement”) with Magic Internacional Argentina FC, S.L. (“Magic”) and GBT Tokenize Corp (“GBT Tokenize”). GBT Tokenize has developed a vital device based on the Technology Portfolio that is ready for commercialization, as well as certain derivative technologies, which positioned GBT Tokenize to further develop or license certain code sources. On April 3, 2023, GBT Tokenize entered its first commercial transaction to date through the sale of the Avant-AI! technology that been developed by GBT Tokenize, based on the Technology Portfolio. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not record the commercial transactions as it was contingent per the Lock-Up term.

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.

 

Basis of Presentation 

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Stock Split 

 

On October 26, 2021, the Company effectuated a 1 for 50 reverse stock split. The share and per share information has been retroactively restated to reflect this reverse stock split.

 

In July 2, 2022 the Company filed a preliminary information statement to the stockholders of record (the “Record Date”) in connection with certain actions to be taken by the written consent by stockholders holding a majority of the voting stock of the Company, dated as of June 28, 2022.

     ●    To amend the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, (the “Articles of Incorporation”) to increase the number of authorized

           shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company from 2,000,000,000 shares to

           10,000,000,000 shares. This action concluded on August 11,

           2022:

 

          (i) authorize the Company’s Board of Directors to effect, in its sole discretion, a reverse stock split of the Common Stock

           in a ratio of up to 1-for-500 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and (ii) authorize the filing of an amendment to the Company’s

           Articles of Incorporation to implement the Reverse Stock Split and any other action deemed necessary to effectuate the

           Reverse Stock Split, without further approval or authorization of stockholders, at any time prior to December 31, 2023. This

           action was not commenced by the Company’s

           board.

 

On October 12, 2023, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 30,000,000,000 (the “Increase Amendment”). The Increase Amendment was approved by the board of directors as well as the shareholders holding in excess of a majority of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the Company.

 

Note 2 – Going Concern

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $308,831,305 and has a working capital deficit of $23,387,928 as of March 31, 2024, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through some private placement offerings of debt and equity securities. These plans, if successful, will mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These CFS do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

 

Note 3 – Discontinued Operations

 

On February 18, 2022, the Company, effective March 1, 2022 entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement (“RSA”) with Mahaser LTD. (“Mahaser”) pursuant to which the Company shares in revenues generated by Mahaser e-commerce sales through the online retail platform in the United States of America. Mahaser owns an e-commerce platform as a store which is the legal, exclusive owner of Ravenholm Electronics. The Company will operate the e-commerce platform and entitled to 95% for all revenue generated by and received by Mahaser from March 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The RSA provides that the Company will be entitled to appoint a manager to Mahaser. As consideration, the Company will pay Mahaser $100,000 no later than March 1, 2022 and issue Mahaser 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock.

Note 4 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include valuation of derivatives and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries; the Company’s 50% owned subsidiaries: GBT Tokenize Corp; and GBT BitSpeed Corp. (currently inactive) and , Gopher Protocol Costa Rica Sociedad De Responsabilidad Limitada (currently inactive), a wholly owned subsidiary, AltCorp Trading LLC, a Costa Rica company (“AltCorp” currently inactive) and Greenwich International Holdings, a Costa Rica corporation (“Greenwich” currently inactive). All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated.

 

For entities determined to be VIEs, an evaluation is required to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates its economic interests in the entity specifically determining if the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“the power”) and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE (“the benefits”). When making the determination whether the benefits received from an entity are significant, the Company considers the total economics of the entity, and analyzes whether the Company’s share of the economics is significant. The Company utilizes qualitative factors, and, where applicable, quantitative factors, while performing the analysis. In addition, the Company’s variable interests in Mahaser obligate the Company to absorb deficits and provide it with the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Mahaser. As a result of this analysis, the Company concluded it is the primary beneficiary of Mahaser and therefore consolidates the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows of Mahaser. The Company performs a qualitative assessment of Mahaser on an ongoing basis to determine if it continues to be the primary beneficiary.

 

Effective July 1, 2023, the Company terminated its joint venture revenue sharing (“Termination Agreement”) with Mahaser LTD (“Mahaser”). Until June 30, 2023, the Company’s variable interests in Mahaser obligate the Company to absorb deficits and provide it with the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Mahaser. As a result of this analysis, the Company concluded it is the primary beneficiary of Mahaser and therefore consolidates the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows of Mahaser until June 30, 2023. The Company performs a qualitative assessment of Mahaser on an ongoing basis to determine if it continues to be the primary beneficiary. Per the Termination Agreement, the Company has no access to Mahaser and ceased consolidated Mahaser as it does not comply with the condition in the qualitative assess, and as such this CFS does not include Mahaser operations for the period ended March 31, 2024.

 

Cash Equivalents

 

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

Funds in Escrow

 

Restricted cash is $375,000 as part of the SURG settlements proceeds that needs to stay in escrow and $19,694 restricted cash that the court on January 28, 2022 awarded the Company with injunction against RWJ defendants, where all funds generating from resale should be deposited into GBT blocked account, and therefore RWJ defendants cannot use these funds without court order, neither the Company. According to the settlement agreement made on September 26, 2022, these funds held in escrow and no longer restricted. The Company entered into the Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (“RJW Agreement”) by and between RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, Robert Warren Jackson, Gregory Bauer (collectively the “RJW Parties”) and W.L. Petrey Wholesale Company, Inc., (“Petrey”) on one hand; and GBT Technologies Inc., on behalf of itself and its agents (collectively the GBT Parties”), on the other hand. The Company the RJW Agreement effective September 26, 2022 with final signatures delivered to the Company on or about October 5, 2022. Among other agreements the parties agreed and stipulated to release all funds currently being held in a blocked account of $19,694 with 50% distributed to the RWJ Parties and 50% to the Company or its assignee.

 

Marketable Securities

 

The Company accounts for investment securities in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Investments – equity securities. Marketable equity securities are reported at FV based on quotations available on securities exchanges with any unrealized gain or loss being reported as a component of other income (expense) on the statement of operations. The portion of marketable equity security expected to be sold within 12 months of the balance sheet date is reported as a current asset. These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in Level 1.

 

Inventory (2022 and interim 2023)

 

The inventory consists of electronic products ready for sale online on e-commerce platforms. It is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and all inventories were returned product from online customers. We value our inventory using the weighted average costing method. Our Company’s policy is to include as a part of inventory any freight incurred to ship the product from our contract vendors to our warehouses. Outbound freight costs to our customers are considered period costs and reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

The Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its FV and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the FV reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s only derivative financial instrument was an embedded conversion feature associated with convertible notes payable due to certain provisions that allow for a change in the conversion price based on a percentage of the Company’s stock price at the date of conversion.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 

For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their FV due to their short maturities.

 

FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the FV of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of FV measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for FV measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FV because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

 

9

 

 

      ●    Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

            

      ●    Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,

            quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or

            liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

            

            

      ●    Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the FV

            measurement.

            

 

The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.

 

For certain financial instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and current liabilities, including convertible notes payable, each qualify as a financial instrument, and are a reasonable estimate of their FV because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest.

 

The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for derivative liabilities as their FV were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company’s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect FV at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the FV being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to FV of derivatives.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company identified the following liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at FV:

Treasury Stock

 

Treasury stock is recorded at cost. The re-issuance of treasury shares is accounted for on a first in, first-out basis and any difference between the cost of treasury shares and the re-issuance proceeds are charged or credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company has 8 shares as treasury shares from acquisitions that commenced in 2011.

 

Reclassification

 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.

Effective July 1, 2023, the Company terminated its joint venture revenue sharing (“Termination Agreement”) with Mahaser LTD (“Mahaser”). Until June 30, 2023, the Company’s variable interests in Mahaser obligate the Company to absorb deficits and provide it with the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Mahaser. The Company evaluated for the period ended on June 30, 2023, whether it has a variable interest in Mahaser, whether Mahaser is a VIE and whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in Mahaser. The Company concluded that it has variable interests in Mahaser on the basis of GBT has 100% control over the JV/revenue sharing, and as such should consolidate the JV into its books and records as it assigned 100% financial responsibility. Mahaser’s equity at risk, as defined by GAAP, is considered to be insufficient to finance its activities without additional support, and, therefore, Mahaser is considered a VIE. As termination Agreement took place during the reporting period, the financial been classified to disclose this operation as discontinued operation.

 

Revenue Recognition 

 

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company’s revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the “modified retrospective” transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. The Company had no significant post-delivery obligations, this new standard did not result in a material recognition of revenue on the Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.

 

Revenue from providing IT consulting services are recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:

 

     ●    executed contracts with the Company’s customers that it believes are legally enforceable;

           

     ●    identification of performance obligations in the respective contract;

           

     ●    determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;

           

     ●    allocation the transaction price to each performance obligation; and

           

     ●    recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

 

These five elements, as applied to each of the Company’s IT revenue category, is summarized below:

 

     ●    IT consulting services - revenue is recorded on a monthly basis as services are provided.

 

These five elements, as applied to each of the Company’s license revenue category, is summarize below:

 

     ●    License services – the one-time related party licensing income recorded as other income upon agreement is executed and

           services are provided and recognized over the term of five

           years.

 

E-Commerce sales – (discontinued during 2023)

 

     ●    Identify the contract(s) with a customer. ASC 606 defines a contract as “an agreement between two or more parties that

           creates enforceable rights and obligations”. Since this is an e-commerce sale on the Amazon of eBay websites, the Company

           just followed the general terms on Amazon or eBay websites and the customer entered into a contract with the Company based

           on the product listed on the Amazon or eBay

           websites;

 

11

 

 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract. According to the contract, the Company is responsible for operation exclusively. The Company is entitled to all revenue which is being paid by Amazon or eBay into a designated bank account and the Company is responsible for all product acquisitions as well as shipments. The only performance obligations were the electronic products that were listed on Amazon or eBay websites and the Company determined each order is one single obligation;

 

Determine the transaction price. The transaction price set to be the listed price on the Amazon or eBay websites;

 

Allocation the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

 

Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Sales are being recognized upon shipment.

 

Variable Interest Entity

 

On February 18, 2022, the Company, effective March 1, 2022 entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement (“RSA”) with Mahaser LTD. (“Mahaser”) pursuant to which the Company shares in revenues generated by Mahaser e-commerce sales through the online retail platform in the United States of America. Mahaser owns an e-commerce platform as a store which is the legal, exclusive owner of Ravenholm Electronics. The Company will operate the e-commerce platform and entitled to 95% for all revenue generated by and received by Mahaser from March 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The RSA provides that the Company will be entitled to appoint a manager to Mahaser. As consideration, the Company will pay Mahaser $100,000 no later than March 1, 2022 and issue Mahaser 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock. The Company shall have no obligations to make any further payments to Mahaser. For any further extensions, the Company will have the option to extend the RSA for annual payment of $200,000, which can be payable with the Company’s shares of common stock payable based on 20 days VWAP prior to issuance. On March 16, 2022 the parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the to the RSA, where all consideration to be paid or issued to Mahaser will be deferred until such time where the e-commerce platform generated in cumulative revenue of $1,000,000.

 

On March 31, 2022, the parties entered into Amendment No. 2 to the RSA, where Mahaser agreed to pay the Company 100% per year for all revenue generated by and received by seller from the sales by Amazon within the United States of America as follows from March 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The Company will be responsible for 100% of the cost of goods sold as well. In addition, the Company is entitled to earn 100% revenues and cost of goods sold of the period from February 1, 2022 to February 28, 2022. On January 1, 2023 the company extended their partnership to December 31, 2023. Effective July 1, 2023, the Company agreed to terminate the RSA with Mahaser Ltd. The period ended on March 31, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 does not include the result of operation by Mahaser, as it ceases being VIE.

 

Income Taxes 

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

 

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented and its current on all its tax filings federal and state until 2022 inclusive.

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share

 

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS assumes that all dilutive securities are converted. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Due to the net income incurred potentially dilutive instruments would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss for all periods presented. The following potentially-dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

Schedule of anti-dilutive shares

Management’s Evaluation of Subsequent Events

 

The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024, through the date which the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Based upon the review, other than described in Note 18 – Subsequent Events, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)—Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract.

In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entity’s own equity.

Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year.

The adoption had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023.

Note 7 – Impaired Investment 

 

Investment in GBT Technologies, S.A.

 

On June 17, 2019, the Company, AltCorp Trading LLC, a Costa Rica company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“AltCorp”), GBT Technologies, S.A., a Costa Rica company (“GBT-CR”) and Pablo Gonzalez, a shareholder’s representative of GBT-CR (“Gonzalez”), entered into and closed an Exchange Agreement (the “GBT Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties exchanged certain securities. In accordance with the Exchange Agreement, AltCorp acquired 625,000 shares of GBT-CR representing 25% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock from Gonzalez for the issuance of 20,000 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company and a Convertible Note in the principal amount of $10,000,000 issued by the Company (the “Gopher Convertible Note”) as well as the transfer and assignment of a Promissory Note payable by Gopher Protocol Costa Rica Sociedad De Responsabilidad Limitada to the Company in the principal amount of $5,000,000 dated February 6, 2019 (of which the underlying security for this Promissory Note is 30,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of Mobiquity Technologies, Inc. (“Mobiquity”) and 60,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of Mobiquity.

 

The Gopher Convertible Note bears interest of 6% and is payable at maturity on December 31, 2021. At the election of Gonzalez, the Gopher Convertible Note can be converted into a maximum of 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder but subject to the Company increasing its authorized shares of common stock, into such number of shares of common stock of the Company as determined by dividing the Stated Value ($500 per share) by the conversion price ($500 per share). The Series H Preferred Stock has no liquidation preference, does not pay dividends and the holder of Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock that the Series H Preferred Stock may be convertible into. Upon conversion of the Gopher Convertible Note and the 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock, Gonzalez would be entitled to less than 50% of the resulting outstanding shares of common stock of the Company following conversion in full and, as a result, such transaction is not considered a change of control.

 

On May 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement and Irrevocable Assignment of Note Balance Principal and Accrued Interest (the “Gonzalez Agreement”) with third party, GBT-CR, IGOR 1 Corp and Gonzalez. Pursuant to the Gonzalez Agreement, without any party admission of liability and to avoid litigation, the parties had agreed to (i) extend the GBT Convertible Note maturity date to December 31,2022, (ii) amend the GBT Convertible Note terms to include a beneficial ownership blocker of 4.99% and a modified conversion feature to the GBT Convertible Note with 15% discount to the market price during the 20 trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date and (iii) provided for an assignment of the GBT Convertible Note by Gonzalez to a third party.

 

GBT-CR is in the business of the strategic management of BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) digital communications processing for enterprises and startups, distributed ledger technology development, AI development and fintech software development and applications.

 

The Company accounted for its investment in GBT-CR using the equity method of accounting; however, in 2020, the Company owned less than 20% after GBT-CR issued additional shares to other investors therefore exercised no control over GBT-CR; therefore, this investment is currently accounted for under the cost method. Moreover, on March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians and to establish consistency across the state in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California was therefore under strict quarantine control and travel has been severely restricted, resulting in disruptions to work, communications, and access to files (due to limited access to facilities). The stay-at-home order was lifted in California only on January 25, 2021. As such, the Company was unable to access or to contact GBT-CR on an on-going basis, and cannot get information about GBT-CR.

Investment in Joint Venture GBT Tokenize Corp

 

On March 6, 2020, the Company through Greenwich, entered into a Joint Venture and Territorial License Agreement (the “Tokenize Agreement”) with Tokenize-It, S.A. (“Tokenize”), which is owned by a Costa Rica Trust represented by Pablo Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”). Gonzalez also represents Gonzalez Costa Rica Trust, which holds a note in the principal amount of $10,000,000 and is also a shareholder of the Company. Under the Tokenize Agreement, the parties formed GBT Tokenize Corp., a Nevada corporation (“GBT Tokenize”). The purpose of GBT Tokenize is to develop, maintain and support source codes for its proprietary technologies including advanced mobile chip technologies, tracking, radio technologies, AI core engine, electronic design automation, mesh, games, data storage, networking, IT services, business process outsourcing development services, customer service, technical support and quality assurance for business, customizable and dedicated inbound and outbound calls solutions, as well as digital communications processing for enterprises and startups (“Technology Portfolio”), throughout the State of California. Upon generating any revenue from the Technology Portfolio, the Joint Venture will earn the first right of refusal for other territories. The Company pledged its 50% ownership in GBT Tokenize and its 100% ownership of Greenwich to Tokenize to secure its Technology Portfolio investment. The Company shall appoint two directors and Tokenize shall appoint one director of GBT Tokenize. Tokenize shall contribute the services and resources for the development of the Technology Portfolio to GBT Tokenize. The Company shall contribute 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (“GBT Shares”) to GBT Tokenize. Tokenize and the Company will each own 50% of GBT Tokenize. The shares were valued at $5,500,000.

 

In addition, GBT Tokenize and Gonzalez entered into a Consulting Agreement in which Gonzalez is engaged to provide services for $33,333 per month payable quarterly which may be paid in shares of common stock calculated by the amount owed divided by the Company’s 10-day VWAP. Gonzalez will provide services in connection with the development of the business as well as GBT Tokenize’s capital raising efforts. The term of the Consulting Agreement is two years. During year ended December 31, 2021, Gonzalez assigned all his accrued balances of $424,731 to Stanley Hills in a private transaction that the Company is not part to. The closing of the Tokenize Agreement occurred on March 9, 2020.

 

Through this Joint Venture the parties commenced development of an intelligent human vital signs’ device, which we currently refer to as the qTerm. The platform is an expansion of the existing license agreement with GBT Tokenize Corp., which provided GBT Tokenize Corp. with an exclusive territory of California to develop certain of the Company’s technology. As the nature of the platform cannot be restricted only to California, the Company’s joint venture GBT Tokenize Corp. will be compensated with additional two hundred million shares of the Company to strengthen its funding, subject to board approval. A provisional patent application for the qTerm Medical Device was filed on March 30, 2020 with the USPTO. The application has been assigned serial number 63001564. The Joint Venture completed successfully the first prototype. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in researching, developing or implementing this product into the market. In order to successfully implement this concept, the Company will need to raise adequate capital to support its research and, if successfully researched, developed and granted regulatory approval, the Company would need to enter into a strategic relationship with a third party that has experience in manufacturing, selling and distributing this product. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in any or all of these critical steps. On May 28, 2021, the parties agreed to amend the Tokenize Agreement to expand territory granted for the Technology Portfolio under the license to GBT Tokenize to include the entire continental United States. The Company has further agreed to issue GBT Tokenize an additional 14,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The shares were valued at $15,400,000. At March 31, 2020, the Company evaluated the carrying amount of this joint venture investment and determined that this investment was fully impaired and as a result an impairment charge of $5,500,000 was taken. At December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated the carrying amount of this joint venture investment and determined that this investment was fully impaired and as a result an impairment charge of $15,400,000 was taken.

 

On July 20, 2023, the Company through its wholly owned inactive subsidiary, Greenwich International Holdings, a Costa Rica corporation (“Greenwich”), entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture (the “2023 Tokenize Agreement”) with Magic Internacional Argentina FC, S.L. (“Magic”) and GBT Tokenize Corp (“GBT Tokenize”).

 

17

 

 

The 2023 Tokenize Agreement restated and replaced the 2022 Tokenize Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Tokenize Agreement, as a result of the contribution of the Technology Portfolio by Tokenize and the subsequent contribution of services for the development of the Technology Portfolio by Tokenize and Magic, GBT Tokenize has been able to continue in operation, which has benefited the Company despite its contribution of 166 million shares of common stock valued at approximately $50,000. In order to maintain its 50% ownership interest in GBT Tokenize, the Company agreed to contribute its portfolio of intellectual property to GBT Tokenize and issue to GBT Tokenize 1,000 shares of Series I Preferred Stock (the “Series I Stock”) with a stated value of $35,000 per share which is convertible into common stock of the Company by dividing the stated value by the conversion price of $0.0035, which, if converted in full would result in the issuance of 10 billion shares of common stock of the Company. Further, the Series I Stock will vote on an as converted basis.

 

The Company pledged its 50% ownership in GBT Tokenize and its 100% ownership of Greenwich to Magic to secure its Technology Portfolio investment.

 

Although the investment was impaired, the product development is still ongoing. The carrying amount of this investment at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $0 and $0, respectively.

$10,000,000 for GBT Technologies S. A. acquisition

 

In accordance with the acquisition of GBT-CR the Company issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $10,000,000. The convertible note bears interest of 6% and is payable at maturity on December 31, 2021. At the election of the holder, the convertible note can be converted into a maximum of 20,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder but subject to the Company increasing its authorized shares of common stock, into such number of shares of common stock of the Company as determined by dividing the Stated Value ($500 per share) by the conversion price ($500 per share). This convertible note may convert into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 85% of the lowest trading price with a 20-day lookback immediately preceding the date of conversion and therefore recorded as derivative liability.

 

On May 19, 2021, the Company, Gonzalez, GBT-CR and IGOR 1 Corp entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement and Irrevocable Assignment of outstanding balance plus accrued interest (the “Gonzalez Agreement”). Pursuant to the Gonzalez Agreement, without any party admission of liability and to avoid litigation, the parties had agreed to (i) extend the GBT convertible note maturity date to December 31, 2022, (ii) amend the GBT convertible note terms to include a beneficial ownership blocker of 4.99% and a modified conversion feature to the GBT convertible note with 15% discount to the market price during the 20 trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date and (iii) provided for an assignment of the GBT convertible note by Gonzalez to a third party. As a result of the change in terms of this convertible note, the Company took a charge related to the modification of debt of $13,777,480 during the year ended December 31, 2021. This convertible note is recorded as derivative liability because of the discounted price on conversion.

 

During the period ended March 31, 2024, IGOR 1 converted $195,500 of the convertible note into 2,300,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the note had an outstanding balance of $4,979,996 and accrued interest of $2,432,897.

In connection with a legal matter filed by the Investor of the $8,340,000 Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture, on December 23, 2019, in the pending arbitration between the Company and the Investor, an Interim Award was entered in favor of the Investor. On January 31, 2020, the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the “Final Award”). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that the Investor was entitled to recovery of their attorney’s fees. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded Investor an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 (presented separately in accounts payable and accrued expenses) and costs of $55,613. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a gain on the settlement of debt of $1,375,556 in 2019 as the difference between the carrying amount of the debt and the amount awarded by the arbitrator. The Company recorded accrued settlement of $4,090,057 and $4,090,057 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Note 12 - Derivative Liability

 

Certain of the convertible notes payable discussed in Note 10 have a conversion price that can be adjusted based on the Company’s stock price which results in the conversion feature being recorded as a derivative liability.

The FV of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the FV of the derivative liability is recorded in the statement of operations under other income (expense).

 

The Company uses a weighted average Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions to measure the FV of derivative liability at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The significant decrease in the fair value of derivative liability was mainly due to the decrease in the stock prices from $0.0002 to $0.0001 from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, as well as the conversions during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and the decrease in remaining convertible principal balances lower the derivative liabilities.

The change is principally due to an increase of gain on the change in FV of derivative liability of 11,195,260, decrease in interest expense of $1,696,407, decrease in debt discount of $114,825, and decrease in other income of $193,628.

 

Net income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $7,159,889 compared to $(5,629,713) for the same period in 2023 due to the factors described above.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Going Concern

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $308,831,305 and has a working capital deficit of $23,387,928 as of March 31, 2024, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through some private placement offerings of debt and equity securities. These plans, if successful, will mitigate the factors which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

 

Our cash and cash equivalent were $173 and $529 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities during the period ended March 31, 2024 was $10,690 compared to $(112,635) during the same period in 2023. The amount provided by operating activities for the period ended March 31, 2024 was primarily related to a net income of $7,159,889 and offset by amortization of debt discount of $32,803, and gain in FV of derivative liability of $7,271,013. Our working capital position changed by going from a working capital deficit of $31,781,634 at December 31, 2023 to a working capital deficit of $23,387,928 at March 31, 2024.

 

Cash flows used in investing activities were $0 during the period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

34

 

 

Cash used in financing activities for the period ended March 31, 2024 was $11,046, compared to $65,063 provided by financing activities for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to the repayment of notes payable of $11,046. Cash from financing activities for the period ended March 31, 2023, was due to proceeds from convertible notes of $104,300 and reduce by repayment of convertible notes of $39,043, and a repayment to related party of $302,700, and an increase in proceeds from related party of $302,506.

 

We sustained net income of $7,159,889 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $23,387,928 and accumulated deficit of $308,831,305 at March 31, 2024.

 

Dividends

 

The Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No cash dividends have been paid or declared since the Date of Inception.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

As a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not required to include the disclosure under this Item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Mansour Khatib, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the applicable period to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 

As a smaller reporting company, with revenues stemming from recent acquisitions and a lack of profitability, the Company does not have the resources to install dedicated staff with deep expertise in all facets of SEC disclosure and GAAP compliance, and does not employ enough accounting staff to have proper separation of duties. As is the case with many smaller reporting companies, the Company will continue to consult with its external auditors and attorneys as it relates to new accounting principles and changes to SEC disclosure requirements. In order to correct this material weakness, the Company engaged a consultant with expertise in SEC disclosure and GAAP compliance. The Company found that this approach worked well in the past and believes it to be the most cost-effective solution available for the foreseeable future. The Company will conduct a review of existing sign-off and review procedures as well as document control protocols for critical accounting spreadsheets. The Company will also increase management’s review of key financial documents and records.

 

As a smaller reporting company, the Company does not have the resources to fund sufficient staff to ensure a complete segregation of responsibilities within the accounting function. However, Company management does review, and will increase the review of, financial statements monthly, and the Company’s external auditor conducts reviews on a quarterly basis. These actions, in addition to the improvements identified above, will minimize any risk of a potential material misstatement occurring.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S INTERIM REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 

Our management, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive and Financial Officer), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ●    Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of our

           assets;

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements

           in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in

           accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;

           and

 

     ●    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of our

           assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria.

 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 

There were no changes during our last fiscal year that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

Legal Proceedings

 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in various litigation matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There is currently no litigation that management believes will have a material impact on the financial position of the Company.

 

Relate to 2022 only: 

 

On or around January 30, 2019, RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, Greg Bauer, and Warren Jackson sued the Company and multiple third and related parties in Superior Court of the State of California - County of Los Angeles, General District in connection with the acquisition of UGO in September 2017. The case number is 19STCV03320 (the “Original Lawsuit”). The complaint in the Original Lawsuit alleges breach of contract, among other causes of action. The Company answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs in the case and third parties on or around February 15, 2019. On or about September 10, 2020, the Company through its agent of service was “served” with a complaint (the Company contested service) that was recently filed against the Company and third parties by Robert Warren Jackson and Gregory Bauer in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.: 20STCV32709 (“Second Lawsuit”). In the Original Lawsuit filed, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claims that they were filing a purported quasi-derivative lawsuit. As such, in this current litigation, the plaintiff is now again claiming the action is a derivative lawsuit. On October 13, 2020, the Second Lawsuit was removed by other defendants into Central District of California (CASE NO. 2:20−cv−09399−RGK−AGR). On February 2, 2021 the Central District of California dismissed the entire Second Lawsuit based on “demand futility”.

 

36

 

 

In the Original lawsuit, the Company filed a cross complaint against the plaintiff and other third parties. Recently, the court has scheduled various hearings and a trial date set for December 27, 2021 which was later continued by the Court to September 28, 2022. It was the Company’s intention to dividend its holdings of its wholly owned subsidiary Ugopher services Corp. (“UGO”). As UGO is the main dispute in the litigations described above, the Company has elected to sell UGO to a third-party effective July 1, 2020. On September 17, 2020, the Company terminated Greg Bauer as consultant (resulting from the sale of UGO), which he confirmed in writing. On or about June 14, 2021 the Company stipulated with plaintiff that all third parties will be released and plaintiff may file a new first amendment complaint that will name only the Company. As such, all third parties other than prior transfer agent of the Company have been dismissed from this litigation. Following the sale of UGO, the Company noticed third parties (including SURG, via its asset manager) to wire the UGO funds to its new bank account. SURG never answered the notice. SURG is the clearing house for UGO. The Company noticed certain third parties that it intends to take legal actions to resolve this issue. On November 12, 2020 the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court – District of Nevada - Case 2:20-cv-02078 against RWJ, Mr. Bauer, Mr. Jackson and against W.L. Petrey Wholesale Company Inc for fraud, breach of contract, Unjust Enrichment and other claims. On January 28, 2022 the court awarded the Company with injunction against RWJ defendants, where all fee funds generating from resale should be deposited into GBT blocked account, and therefore RWJ defendants cannot use these funds without court order. The Company entered into the Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (“RJW Agreement”) by and between RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, Robert Warren Jackson, Gregory Bauer (collectively the “RJW Parties”) and W.L. Petrey Wholesale Company, Inc., (“Petrey”) on one hand; and GBT Technologies Inc., on behalf of itself and its agents (collectively the GBT Parties”), on the other hand. The Company the RJW Agreement effective September 26, 2022 with final signatures delivered to the Company on or about October 5, 2022. Pursuant to the RJW Agreement, the parties have agreed to settle, release, and otherwise resolve all known or unknown claims between them and agreed to jointly stipulate, move, or otherwise dismiss the lawsuits filed in the United States District Court of Nevada (Case No. 2:20-cv- 02078), in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District (Case Nos. 19STCV03320 and 20STCV32709), and in the United States District Court of the Central District of California (Case No. 2:20-cv-09399-RGK-AGR) with prejudice. The parties agreed and stipulated to release all funds currently being held in a blocked account of $19,809 with 50% distributed to the RWJ Parties and 50% distributed the Company or its assignee. The Parties also entered into the InComm Assignment Agreement (“IAA”) which assigned, transferred and conveyed all proceeds derived from the RWJ Parties’ agreements with Interactive Communications International, Inc., and its affiliate Hi Technology Corp., including but not limited to that Master Distribution and Service Agreement between Interactive Communications International, Inc. and Petrey d/b/a UGO-HUB dated August 29, 2016, as amended (collectively referred to as the “InComm Proceeds”), and which shall divide the InComm Proceeds 90% to the Company or its assignee and 10% to the RWJ Parties or their assignee. Finally, the Company agreed to pay $40,000 to the RWJ Parties or their assignee. The Company accrued $49,847 expenses represent the final amounts due to the RJW Parties. The Company under a different settlement agreement with SURG, committed to assign the IAA. As such, on October 5, 2022 and as cumulation of all settlement agreements the Company issued a request to SURG regarding release of certain escrow funds and the execution of an assignment of rights as contemplated in the aforereferenced agreement.

 

On December 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Discover Growth Fund, LLC (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company issued a Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) of $8,340,000. In connection with the issuance of the Debenture and pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company issued a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to acquire up to 225,000 shares of common stock for a term of three years (the “Warrant”) on a cash-only basis at an exercise price of $100 per share with respect to 50,000 Warrant Shares, $75 with respect to 75,000 Warrant Shares and $50 with respect to 100,000 Warrant Shares. The holder may not exercise any portion of the Warrants to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise. The outstanding principal amount may be converted at any time into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 95% of the Market Price less $5 (the conversion price is lowered by 10% upon the occurrence of each Triggering Event – the current conversion price is 75% of the Market Price less $5.00). The Market Price is the average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices during the period the Debenture is outstanding. On May 28, 2019, the Investor delivered to the Company a “Notice of Default and Notice of Sale of Collateral” (the “Notice”). On December 23, 2019, in arbitration between the Company and the Investor, an Interim Award was entered in favor of the Investor. On January 31, 2020, the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the “Final Award”). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Debenture constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that the Investor was entitled to recovery of their attorney’s fees. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded Investor an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 and costs of $55,613. On February 18, 2020,

 

37

 

 

the Company filed a motion with the United States District Court District of Nevada (the “Nevada Court”) to confirm the Final Award and a motion to consolidate Investor’s application to confirm the Final Award filed in the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM) (the “Virgin Island Court”). On February 27, 2020, the Nevada Court denied the Company’s motion to confirm the Final Award and motion to consolidate and further decided that the confirmation of the Final Award should be litigated in the Virgin Island Court. As such, on February 27, 2020, the Company filed a Notice of Entry of Order as well as a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award, address the outstanding issues regarding whether Investor’s rights are subordinated to other creditors and, thereafter, oversee a commercially reasonable foreclosure sale (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM). It was the Company’s position that the Final Award must first be confirmed and all questions regarding the rights of Investor relative to those of other creditors must be determined before any foreclosure sale can proceed. It is further the position of the Company that the previously disclosed foreclosure sale scheduled by Investor is being conducted in a commercially unreasonable manner and that if Discover proceeded forward with the foreclosure sale it did so at its own risk. Nevertheless, on February 28, 2020, Investor advised that it conducted a sale of the Company’s assets. As the date of this report Investor failed to present a deed of sale for the alleged sale that allegedly took place as noticed. The Company filed with Virgin Island Court the motions disputing the validity of the alleged sale. On July 28, 2020, Investor filed in the State of Nevada a motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716. The Company filed an answer on August 11, 2020. On October 16, 2020, Investor motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716 was denied. This case is still pending with the Federal court and the Court has not taken any substantive action in the matter as of the date of this report. Based on Discover notice in writing of selling all the Company’s assets, the Company intend to invoice Discover for that sale and offset the settlement amount at the end of the year.

 

Relate to 2023:

 

On or about July 9, 2021, the Company filed a lawsuit in District Court in Clack County Nevada – Department 19 (Case number A-21-837631-C) against Terry Taylor and TTSG Holdings, Inc for breach of contract, breach of covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unjust Enrichment and declaratory relief for failure of providing consulting services per contract they entered. The Company is demanding the return of 240,000 shares issued, return of the $5,000 payments, recission of the consulting agreement, and attorney’s fees and costs. As Terry Taylor and TTSG Holdings failed to appear to a notice of deposition, the Company filed for a summary judgment. On January 20, 2023 the court issued a $708,821 writ of execution against Terry Taylor and TTSG. As of filing date, the Company has not collected any amount issued by the Court from Terry Taylor and TTSG.

 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

 

As a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not required to include the disclosure under this Item 1A. Risk Factors. Despite the fact that we are not required to provide risk factors, we consider the following factors to be risks to our continued growth and development:

 

WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY IN AN EVOLVING INDUSTRY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

 

We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing our business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to:

 

    ●   accurately forecast our revenues and plan our operating expenses;

 

    ●   successfully expand our business;

 

    ●   assimilate our acquisitions;

 

    ●   adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways consumers and businesses interact with technology;

 

    ●   avoid interruptions or disruptions in the offering of our products and our services;

 

    ●   develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as

         well as the deployment of new features and

         products;

 

38

 

 

    ●   hire, integrate and retain talented sales, customer service, technology and other personnel; and

 

    ●   effectively manage rapid growth in personnel and operations; and 

 

    ●   global COVID-19 pandemic

 

If the demand for our services and/or platforms/products offered or our products under development are not finalized, our business will be harmed. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and results of operations.

  

OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO EVALUATE OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

 

We have a limited operating history and, as a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on the historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve. Because of the uncertainties related to our limited historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or continue to incur losses.

 

THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS CAUSED DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN DELAYS ON EXISTING PROJECTS AND MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS

 

The Company operates in a high-tech marketplace and relies on professionals and partnerships all over the world, which is impacted by the global pandemic, causing the Company’s resources to be affected. Our business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the coronavirus disease COVID-19.

 

An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, PRC, in late 2019 and expanded globally. COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat.

 

Since then, other measures have been imposed in other countries and major cities in the USA, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and throughout the world in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The World Health Organization (the “WHO”) is closely monitoring and evaluating the situation. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, expanding its assessment of the threat beyond the global health emergency it had announced in January. Any outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments in the USA or elsewhere in the world may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business. The stay-at-home order was lifted in California on January 25, 2021, and as such we were able to relocate our virtual offices space and resume “normal” operations.

 

In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak caused disruptions in our development operations, which resulted in delays on exiting projects. The entire country, the economy in general has begun to slowly re-open following the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the omicron variants surfaced and has significantly impacted the United States and globally. However, in the event COVID-19, the omicron variant or other variant is to worsen or again surface any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the development, delivery and assembly process within any of our activities could continue to result in, increased costs and reduced revenue.

 

We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants will continue to be effectively contained. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers and vendors or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 

39

 

 

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN PROFITABILITY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY GOING FORWARD

 

The Company does not accrue or capitalize development costs (or any costs to this effect) and expense it to its profit and loss statements as required by US GAAP. As such, the Company incurred a net income of $7,159,889 for the period ended March 31, 2024 and net loss of $5,629,713 for the period ended March 31, 2023. If we incur additional significant operating losses, our stock price, may decline, perhaps significantly. Our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above. Our business plan is speculative and unproven. There is no assurance that we will be successful in executing our business plan or that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be able to curtail our losses now or in the future. Further, as we are an emerging enterprise, we expect that net losses will continue, and our working capital deficiency will increase.

 

WE HAVE NOT GENERATED POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW IS UNCERTAIN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED, OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD BE FORCED TO SUSPEND OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS.

 

Our operations have not generated positive cash flow for any period, and we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and short-term and long-term debt and convertible debt. Our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our future prospects difficult. The actual amount of funds that we will need to meet our operating needs will be determined by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the timing and volume of sales transactions, the success of our marketing strategy, market acceptance of our products, the success of our manufacturing and research and development efforts (including any unanticipated delays), our manufacturing and labor costs, the costs associated with obtaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, regulatory changes, competition, technological developments in the market, evolving industry standards and the amount of working capital investments we are required to make.

 

Our ability to continue to operate until we are able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to generate sufficient positive cash flow from our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations, our business and future prospects will be adversely affected and we could be forced to suspend or discontinue operations.

 

The Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $22,661,325 and an accumulated deficit of $308,831,305 at March 31, 2024.

 

WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH, AND THIS CAPITAL MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.

 

We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and we will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Further, we need additional capital to continue operations. Accordingly, we need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds. We expect that we have sufficient capital to maintain operations through the year 2024. In order to fully implement our business plan, we will need to raise about $10,000,000 If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business may be harmed.

 

40

 

 

WE DEPEND UPON KEY PERSONNEL AND NEED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

 

Our success depends on our inability to attract and retain key personnel, including our existing personal, and our inability to do so may materially and adversely affect our business operations. The loss of qualified personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Additionally, the success of the Company’s operations will largely depend upon its ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key management personnel. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guaranty that the Company will be able to attract such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for the Company.

 

OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL SUFFER AND JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS

 

We require substantial capital to support our operations. If we are unable to generate adequate cash flows from our operations, maintain adequate financing or other sources of capital are not available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our operations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, financial condition and business prospects.

 

THERE IS CURRENTLY A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. FAILURE TO FURTHER DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN A TRADING MARKET COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO SELL YOUR STOCK.

 

There is a limited public market for our Common Stock, which is traded on the OTC under the symbol GTCH. We cannot give any assurances that there will ever be a mature, developed market for our common stock. Failure to further develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our shares and make it difficult for you to sell your shares or recover any part of your investment in us. Even if a market for our common stock does develop in a material way, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating to our future operating performance and the profitability of our operations, factors such as variations in our interim financial results, or various, as yet unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

 

IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD. AS A RESULT, CURRENT AND POTENTIAL STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK.

 

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our brand and operating results could be harmed. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the lack of resources and the reliance on outside consultants. We intend to increase management’s review of our financials. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.

Additional Risks Related to Our Common Stock

 

Because we are quoted on the OTC marketplace instead of a national securities exchange, our investors may experience significant volatility in the market price of our stock and have difficulty selling their shares.

 

Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market Group’s OTC marketplace under the ticker symbol “GTCH”. The OTC is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes and last sale prices in over-the-counter securities. Trading in shares quoted on the OTC is often thin and characterized by volatility. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume and market conditions. As a result, there may be wide fluctuations in the market price of the shares of our Common Stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance, and this volatility, when it occurs, may have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Moreover, the OTC is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on this platform is more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national quotation system or stock exchange. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to realize a fair price of their shares when they determine to sell them or may have to hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for our Common Stock improves.

 

Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.

 

The equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our Common Stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our Common Stock has been low and may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.

 

We have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay cash dividends.

 

We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, to develop and deliver our products and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our Common Stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our Common Stock.

 

Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our Common Stock.

 

Of the 16,813,229,180 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this Report, approximately 766,217,939 are restricted and 16,047,011,241 shares are freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule 144. Any substantial sale of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.

 

You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.

 

To raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any future offering at a price per share that is lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, which would result in those newly issued shares being diluted. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders, which could impair the value of your shares. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.

Our charter documents and Nevada law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.

 

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Nevada law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:

 

    ●   limit who may call stockholder meetings;

 

    ●   do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and

 

    ●   provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a

         quorum.

 

There are limitations on director/officer liability.

 

As permitted by Nevada law, our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director’s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our charter provision and Nevada law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 

Penny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities.

 

The SEC adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5 per share or an exercise price of less than $5 per share, subject to certain exceptions. A security listed on a national securities exchange is exempt from the definition of a penny stock. Our Common Stock is not currently listed on a national security exchange. Our Common Stock is therefore subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by such rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.

 

Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Broker dealers must wait two business days after providing buyers with disclosure materials regarding a security before effecting a transaction in such security. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and affect the ability of investors to sell our securities in the secondary market and the price at which such purchasers can sell any such securities, thereby affecting the liquidity of the market for our Common Stock.

  

Stockholders should also be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:

 

    ●   control of the market for the security by one or more broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;

 

    ●   manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;

 

    ●   “boiler room” practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;

 

    ●   excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and

 

    ●   the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired

         level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor

         losses.

 

43

 

 

FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.

 

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (referred to as FINRA) has rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock.

 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

 

During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company had the following transactions in its common stock:

 

      ●     Of 6,559,534,118 Shares issued for the conversion of convertible notes of $555,680 and accrued interest of $1,880.

   

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities

 

On December 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Discover Growth Fund, LLC (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company issued a Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) in the aggregate face value of $8,340,000. In connection with the issuance of the Debenture and pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company issued a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to acquire up to 225,000 shares of common stock for a term of three years (the “Warrant”) on a cash-only basis at an exercise price of $100.00 per share with respect to 50,000 Warrant Shares, $75.00 with respect to 75,000 Warrant Shares and $50.00 with respect to 100,000 Warrant Shares. The holder may not exercise any portion of the Warrants to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise. The outstanding principal amount may be converted at any time into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 95% of the Market Price less $5.00 (the conversion price is lowered by 10% upon the occurrence of each Triggering Event – the current conversion price is 75% of the Market Price less $5.00). The Market Price is the average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices during the period the Debenture is outstanding. On May 28, 2019, the Investor delivered to the Company a “Notice of Default and Notice of Sale of

 

Collateral” (the “Notice”). On December 23, 2019, in arbitration between the Company and the Investor, an Interim Award was entered in favor of the Investor. On January 31, 2020, the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the “Final Award”). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Debenture constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that the Investor was entitled to recovery of their attorney’s fees. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded Investor an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 and costs in the amount of $55,613. On February 18, 2020, the Company filed a motion with the United States District Court District of Nevada (the “Nevada Court”) to confirm the Final Award and a motion to consolidate Investor’s application to confirm the Final Award filed in the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM) (the “Virgin Island Court”). On February 27, 2020, the Nevada Court denied the Company’s motion to confirm the Final Award and motion to consolidate and further decided that the confirmation of the Final Award should be litigated in the Virgin Island Court. As such, on February 27, 2020, the Company filed a Notice of Entry of Order as well as a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award, address the outstanding issues regarding whether Investor’s rights are subordinated to other creditors and, thereafter, oversee a commercially reasonable foreclosure sale (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM). It was the Company’s position that the Final Award must first be confirmed and all questions regarding the rights of Investor relative to those of other creditors must be determined before any foreclosure sale can proceed. It is further the position of the Company that the previously disclosed foreclosure sale scheduled by Investor is being conducted in a commercially unreasonable manner and that if Discover proceeded forward with the foreclosure sale it did so at its own risk. Nevertheless, on February 28, 2020, Investor advised that it conducted a sale of the Company’s assets. As the date of this report Investor failed to present a deed of sale for the alleged sale that allegedly took place as noticed. The Company filed with Virgin Island Court the motions disputing the validity of the alleged sale. On July 28, 2020, Investor filed in the State of Nevada a motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716. The Company filed an answer on August 11, 2020. On October 16, 2020, Investor motion for attorneys $48,844 and costs $716 was denied. This case is still pending with the Federal court and the Court has not taken any substantive action in the matter as of the date of this report. Based on Discover notice in writing of selling all the Company’s assets, the Company intend to invoice Discover for that sale and offset the settlement amount at the end of the year.
