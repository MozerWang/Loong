GENERATION INCOME PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 – Nature of Operations 

Generation Income Properties, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Maryland corporation on September 19, 2015. The Company is an internally managed real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail, office and industrial properties net leased to high quality tenants in major markets throughout the United States. 

The Company formed Generation Income Properties L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) in October 2015. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership or its direct or indirect subsidiaries. The Company is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of March 31, 2024 owned 95.3% of the outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership. The Company formed a Maryland entity GIP REIT OP Limited LLC in 2018 that owns 0.001% of the Operating Partnership. 

The Company places each property in a separate entity which may have a Redeemable Non-Controlling interest as a member.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis owned 26 properties.   

 

Management’s Liquidity Plans and Going Concern        

 

On August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In accordance with ASU 2014-05, management’s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.       

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company generated positive operating cash flows of $25,977 and had cash on hand of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2024. Two secured mortgage loans which have a principal balance of $7.3 million and $4.5 million as of March 31, 2024 will mature on September 30, 2024 and October 23, 2024, respectively. Our current and anticipated liquidity is less than the principal balance of these obligations. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability, which includes a plan to refinance these two mortgage loans at maturity. The Company has been engaged in active conversations with the current lender on a refinance. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such refinance on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. The failure of the Company to refinance on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The Company adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting. Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.

Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Generation Income Properties, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and all of the direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the Company’s subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The ownership interests of other investors in these entities are recorded as non-controlling interests or redeemable non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are adjusted each period for additional contributions, distributions, and the allocation of net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interests. Investments in entities for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not have financial or operating control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company’s share of the earnings (or losses) of these entities are included in consolidated net income or loss.

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.

Cash 

The Company considers all demand deposits, cashier’s checks and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Amounts included in restricted cash represent funds owned by the Company related to tenant escrow reimbursements and immediate capital repair reserve. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that sums to the total of those amounts at the end of the periods presented on the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Revenue Recognition 

The Company leases real estate to its tenants under long-term net leases which the Company accounts for as operating leases. Those leases that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to straight-line rents, deferred rent liability includes $189,708 and $280,332 of prepaid rent as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Company reviews the collectability of charges under its tenant operating leases on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant’s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic conditions in the area where the property is located. In the event that uncollectability exists with respect to any tenant changes, the Company would recognize an adjustment to Rental income. The Company’s review of collectability of charges under its operating leases includes any accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line rents. There were no allowances for receivables recorded during three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.

The Company’s leases provide for reimbursement from tenants for common area maintenance (“CAM”), insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses (“recoverable costs”). A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued. 

The Company often recognizes above- and below-market lease intangibles in connection with acquisitions of real estate. The capitalized above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income over the remaining term of the related leases. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company records all equity-based incentive grants to employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors in compensation costs based on their fair values on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the outstanding equity awards. 

Investments in Real Estate

Acquisitions of real estate are recorded at cost. The Company assigns the purchase price of real estate to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, site improvements, and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the value of in-place leases and above- or below- market leases assumed with the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the Company assesses whether the purchase of the real estate falls within the definition of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 and to date has concluded that all asset transactions are asset acquisitions. Therefore, each acquisition has been recorded at the purchase price whereas assets and liabilities, inclusive of closing costs, are allocated to land, building, site improvements, tenant improvements, and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. 

The fair value of the in-place leases are estimated as the cost to replace the leases including loss of rent, commissions and legal fees. The in-place leases are amortized over the remaining team of the leases as amortization expense. The fair value of the above- or below-market lease is estimated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the estimated current market lease rate expected over the remaining non-cancelable life of the lease. The capitalized above- or below-market lease values are amortized as a decrease or increase to rental income over the remaining term of the lease inclusive of the renewal option periods that are considered probable at acquisition.

 

Depreciation Expense 

Real estate and related assets are stated net of accumulated depreciation. Renovations, replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for ordinary

maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the buildings, which are generally between 15 and 50 years, and site improvements, which are generally 5 to 9 years. Tenant improvements are amortized over the lease terms of the tenants, which is generally between 2 and 10 years, with two tenant improvements amortized over 27 years. 

 

Lease Liabilities

 

The Company has a certain property within its portfolio that is on land subject to a ground lease with a third party, which is classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as investment in real estate and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.

 

Under ASC 842, the Company recognizes a lease liability for its ground lease and corresponding right of use asset related to this same ground lease which is classified as an operating lease. A key input in estimating the lease liability and resulting right of use asset is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rate implicit in the contract is not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground lease, including mortgage market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and the payment terms present in the lease. This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for the lease to measure the lease liability.

Impairments 

The Company reviews investments in real estate and related lease intangibles for possible impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable though operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Events or changes in circumstances that may occur include, but are not limited to, significant changes in real estate market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end of the previously estimated life. Impairments are measured to the extent the current book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less disposition costs for any assets classified as held for sale. An impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 resulting from the reduction in the anticipated holding period of the property which was reclassified as held for sale in the three months ended March 31, 2024. There were no impairments in the Company's investments in real estate during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, and purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. The Company may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results. 

 

Real Estate Held for Sale  

The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when certain criteria have been met, and management believes it is probable that the disposition will occur within one year. Properties are held for sale for a period longer than one year if events or circumstances out of the Company's control occur that delay the sale and while management continues to be committed to the plan of sale and is performing actions necessary to respond to the conditions causing the delay the properties held for sale remain salable in their current condition. Assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, and depreciation and amortization are no longer recognized. Held for sale properties are evaluated quarterly to ensure that properties continue to meet the held for sale criteria. If properties are required to be reclassified from held for sale to held for use due to changes to a plan of sale, they are recorded at the lower of fair value or the carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used. Properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria are accounted for as operating properties.

The Company executed a contract to sell the property located at 15091 SW Alabama, Huntsville, AL for $6.15 million in March 2024 and as of the reporting date is engaged in due diligence with the buyer. The property's sale is anticipated to close within the next quarter. As such, the Company has reclassified the asset to Held for sale assets net of the costs of sales at a carrying value of approximately $5.75 million and recorded an impairment loss of approximately $1.06 million. 

 

Income Taxes 

The Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Section 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable

income that is currently distributed to stockholders. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the Company's consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary of which no income was generated during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company also recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is not more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained on examination, including resolution of the related processes, if any. As of each balance sheet date, unrecognized benefits are reassessed and adjusted if the Company’s judgment changes as a result of new information. No liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of March 31, 2024 or 2023. At March 31, 2024, the Company's tax returns for the years 2020 forward remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.

Earnings per Share 

In accordance with ASC 260, basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss attributable to the Company that is available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock warrants, using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive securities such as warrants and convertible membership units of the Operating Partnership (“GIP LP Units”) if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, all potentially dilutive securities were excluded because the effect was anti-dilutive. 

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to estimates that may change in the future.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 

•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs.  See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 10 for additional information on the Company's fair value measurements.

Note 5 – Leases

 

Lessor Accounting

All of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases. The Company's rental income is comprised of both fixed and variable income. Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent. The Company’s leases also provide for reimbursement from recoverable costs. A portion of our operating cost reimbursement revenue is estimated each period and is recognized as rental income in the period the recoverable costs are incurred and accrued. Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis. Variable lease income includes the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of recoverable costs incurred. The following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

Lessee Accounting 

13



 

The Company acquired one property on March 9, 2022 that is subject to a non-cancelable, long-term ground lease where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased the land to the Company. Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold in this property. This ground lease expires in 2084 including those options the Company deems probable of exercising. The ground lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods. Operating lease expense was approximately $93,762 and $93,762 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There are no variable lease expenses required to be paid by the Company as lessee per the lease terms. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of the lease liability, net was $60,244 and $58,175 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

The following table summarizes the undiscounted future cash flows for subsequent years ending December 31 attributable to the lease liability as of March 31, 2024 and provides a reconciliation to the lease liability included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024.

After 24 months, the contribution agreement allows for the investor to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its units for either (i) the Redemption Amount (within the meaning of the Partnership Agreement), or (ii) until forty nine (49) months from date of Closing, cash in an agreed-upon Value (within the meaning of the Partnership Agreement) of $10.00 per share. As such, the Company has determined this equity should be classified as temporary equity at redemption value. On February 7, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a Unit Issuance Agreement and Amendment to Contribution and Subscription Agreement with LMB Owenton I LLC in which the Operating Partnership and LMB Owenton I LLC agreed to delay the Contributor’s right to require the redemption of the Contributor’s GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership until after 36 months on January 14th, 2025 and for a reduced redemption price of $7.15 per GIP LP Unit. Such agreement was made in consideration of the issuance to LMB Owenton I LLC of an additional 44,228 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership, resulting in Contributor owning an aggregate of 155,185 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at redemption value of $1,109,570 as of March 31, 2024.

As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a temporary equity at redemption value. On March 21, 2022, the Company received notice from an Operating Partnership common unit holder to redeem 10,166 units at $20.00 per unit for a total of $203,326 and paid the unit holder on June 24, 2022.

As such, the Company recorded an other payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into August 9, 2022 and continue to pay unit distributions on current units outstanding. In accordance with the Redemption Agreement the Company has made payments of $1,554,920 to date, reducing the current balance of the other payable - related party to $1,357,380 as of  March 31, 2024.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued approximately $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes incurred by a remaining partner in one of our partnerships pursuant to tax protection agreement and is included in Accrued Expense - Related Party on the face of the balance sheet and the balance remained unchanged as of March 31, 2024.

LC2-NNN Pref, LLC  

  

In connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”) pursuant to which LC2 made a $12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE,  together  with a commitment to make an additional $2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company’s Rockford, Illinois property (the “LC2 Investment”).  The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership. 

 

The Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount.  Upon a failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.         

 

Under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having been paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.         

 

Due to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $1,288,726 as of March 31, 2024.     

 

Each of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the discretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the Operating Partnership ("GIP LP Units"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the Operating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such preferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition. 

Non-Controlling Interest (Permanent Equity)

As part of the Company’s acquisition of one property on November 30, 2020 for $1,847,700 in Tampa, FL, the Operating Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with GIP Fund 1, LLC that resulted in the issuance of 24,309 GIP LP Units in the Operating Partnership at $20.00 per share for a total value of $486,180.  At the time of the acquisition, the Company’s President owned 11% of GIP Fund 1. GIP Fund 1 has since been dissolved and the GIP Units are now directly owned by the former members of GIP Fund 1. After 12 months, the contribution agreement allows for the former members of GIP Fund 1 to require the Operating Partnership to redeem, all or a portion of its GIP LP Units for common stock of the Company. As such, the Company has determined their equity should be classified as a Non-controlling interest.

The Company amortized debt issuance costs and debt discount during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 to interest expense of approximately $47,780 and $28,865, respectively. The Company did not pay any debt issuance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Each mortgage loan requires the Company to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios as noted above. In addition, two mortgage loans, one encumbered by six properties and requiring a 1.50 DSCR, and another stand alone mortgage loan requiring a 1.50 DSCR, require the Company to maintain a 54% loan to fair market stabilized value ratio. Fair market stabilized value shall be determined by the lender by reference to acceptable guides and indices or appraisals from time to time at its discretion. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants with the exception of one project level DSCR covenant for 2510 Walmer Ave. Our Bayport Credit Union loan covenant requires project level, property level and portfolio level DSCR minimum testing. At the project-level, 2510 Walmer Ave tested at a 1.17:1 DSCR, compared with the 1.25:1 project level minimum DSCR, driven by its vacancy since January 2023. According to the governing loan document, failing to meet DSCR coverage requirements is a technical default triggering the risk of forfeiture of the property, accelerating the repayment of the remaining outstanding balance of the loan at the lender's discretion. All other DSCR covenants tested compliant and the lender has indicated no intention of action. Additionally, a new lease was executed for 2510 Walmer Ave. on March 28, 2024 and will restore the property to full occupancy upon commencement on May 1, 2024.  

On April 1, 2022, the Company entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of the Company's properties. The loan agreements consist of one loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value, and one loan in the amount of $2.1 million on the property previously held in the tenancy-in-common investment at an interest rate of 3.85% from April 1, 2022 through and until March 31, 2027. In conjunction with the LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, the Company assumed the original $2.1 million loan on the property with a remaining balance of $2,079,178 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity date of March 31, 2032, the interest rate adjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. The Company’s CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership.  

On August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE ("GIP Borrower"), entered into a Loan Agreement with Valley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of $21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding principal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published by Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25%, with interest payable monthly after each 30-day interest period.  However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum.  Payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10, 2028.  The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees.  The loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that had outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries of the Company that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default and other customary affirmative and negative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on investments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales of properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.

The Company’s President and CEO also has personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.7 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks - South Tampa, FL; vacant - Huntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL property. In addition, the Company’s President and CEO has provided a guaranty of the Company’s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the GSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans ("Bayport loans") with an aggregate principal amount of $11.8 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred a guaranty fee expense to the Company's CEO of $97,898 and 60,493, respectively, recorded to interest expense. In January 2024 the Company paid $385,395 to the CEO for guaranty fees from July 2023 through June 2024 of which $96,360 remained unamortized and is included in Prepaid guaranty fees – related party on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024.

 

On August 9, 2022 the Company and Operating Partnership entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, the Company recorded an Other payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and has made payments to date totaling $1,554,920 as of March 31, 2024 with a remaining balance of $1,357,380 and $1,809,840 outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.     

 

On October 14, 2022, the Company entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity partner and therefore a related party, for $1,500,000 that is due on October 14, 

21



 

2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9%, simple interest. Interest is payable monthly. The loan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership’s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets pursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC. On July 21, 2023, the Company amended and restated the promissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to $5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to October 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the amount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note.

The Company has not elected hedge accounting and has reported periodic changes in derivative valuations in Gain on derivative valuation, net for $380,550 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a Derivative Liability of $169,942 and derivative asset of $148,710, which was included in Escrow Deposits and Other assets on the face of the balance sheet.   

The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. All inputs are considered Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows:

Note 11 – Subsequent Events 

 

On April 4, 2024 and May 3, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a distribution of $0.039 per share monthly cash distribution for shareholders of record of our common stock as of April 15, 2024 and May 15, 2024, respectively. April distributions were paid on May 1, 2024 and we anticipate May distributions to be paid on or around May 31, 2024. The Operating Partnership common unit holders received the same distribution.  

Subsequent to March 31, 2024 but before the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, 23,000 Investor Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis for 10% of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Investor Warrant, as the volume-weighted average trading price of the Company’s shares of Common Stock on Nasdaq was below the then-effective exercise price of the Investor Warrant for 10 consecutive trading days as of the date the Investor Warrants became exercisable. As such, 2,300 shares of common stock were issued upon exercise.

Public Offering and Nasdaq Listing

 

In September 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million including issuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The common stock and warrants included in the units (which were separated into one share of common stock and one warrant) currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “GIPR” and “GIPRW,” respectively.

 

Our Investments 

The following are characteristics of our properties as of March 31, 2024:

•Creditworthy Tenants. Approximately 65% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent ("ABR") as of March 31, 2024 was derived from tenants that have (or whose parent company has) an investment grade credit rating from a recognized credit rating agency of “BBB-” or better. Our largest tenants are the General Service Administration, Dollar General, EXP Services, and Kohl’s Corporation and contributed approximately 63% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent. 

•% Leased. Our portfolio is 93% leased and occupied. 

•Contractual Rent Growth. Approximately 91% of the leases in our current portfolio (based on ABR as of March 31, 2024) provide for increases in contractual base rent during future years of the current term or during the lease extension periods. 

•Average Effective Annual Rental per Square Foot. Average effective annual rental per square foot is 14.75. 

Given the nature of our leases, our tenants either pay the realty taxes directly or reimburse us for such costs. We believe all of our properties are adequately covered by insurance.

•General, administrative and organizational costs increased by $105,650 driven by an increase in accounting, audit and tax fees during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

•Building expenses increased by $341,067 due to an overall increase driven by the integration of the acquired 13 property portfolio from Modiv in August 2023 compared the portfolio in operation during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

•Depreciation and amortization increased by $669,055 driven by the integration of the since acquired 13 property portfolio from Modiv compared the portfolio in operation during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

•Interest expense, net increased by $551,531 driven by the incremental interest expense of approximately $390,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to Company's borrowing of approximately $21 million of mortgage debt secured by the acquired 13 property portfolio. An additional incremental increase is the result of the guaranty fee expense to the Company's CEO of $97,898 recorded to interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Guaranty fee expense incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $60,493.

•Compensation costs decreased by $69,272 primarily due to savings in salary expense and for accounting and administrative staff.

Net loss

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss of $1,879,096 and $1,190,353, respectively. 

Other expense 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we accrued $0 and $506,000 relating to the potential reimbursement of federal, state and local income taxes incurred by a remaining partner in one of our partnerships pursuant to a tax protection agreement. 

 

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $946,124 and $127,214, respectively. The variance is attributable to additional redeemable non-controlling interests established during the second half of fiscal year 2023 to facilitate acquisitions, namely the acquisition of the 13 property Modiv portfolio in August 2023. 

Net loss attributable to common shareholders 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated a net loss attributable to our shareholders of $2,920,220 and $1,317,567, respectively. 

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We require capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses. Our capital sources may include net proceeds from offerings of our equity securities, cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities. As of March 31, 2024, we had total cash (unrestricted and restricted) of $1,690,320, properties with a gross cost basis of $96,539,788 and outstanding mortgage loans with a principal balance of $57,823,894. 

In September 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,665,000 units at a price to the public of $10 per unit generating net proceeds of $13.8 million including issuance costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

On April 1, 2022, we entered into two mortgage loan agreements with an aggregate balance of $13.5 million to refinance seven of our properties. The loan agreements consist of one loan in the amount of $11.4 million secured by six properties and allocated to each property based on each property's appraised value, and one loan in the amount of $2.1 million on the property previously held in the 

26



 

tenancy-in-common investment at an interest rate of 3.85% from April 1, 2022 through and until March 31, 2027. In conjunction with the LC2 Investment to purchase the remaining interest in the tenancy-in-common interest discussed above, the Company assumed the original $2.1 million loan on the property with a remaining balance of $2,079,178 and recognized a discount of $383,767. Effective April 1, 2027 and through the maturity date of March 31, 2032, the interest rate adjusts to the 5-year Treasury plus 2.5% and is subject to a floor of 3.85%. Our CEO entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which he guaranteed the payment obligations under the promissory notes if they become due as a result of certain “bad-boy” provisions, individually and on behalf of the Operating Partnership. 

On August 10, 2023, GIP13, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GIP SPE ("GIP Borrower"), entered into a Loan Agreement with Valley pursuant to which Valley made a loan to the Company in the amount of $21.0 million to finance the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio. The outstanding principal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate for each 30-day interest period equal to the compounded average of the secured overnight financing rate published by Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the thirty-day period prior to the last day of each 30-day interest rate for the applicable interest rate period plus 3.25%, with interest payable monthly after each 30-day interest period.  However, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 7.47% per annum.  Payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately $156,000 are due and payable monthly, with all remaining principal and accrued but unpaid interest due and payable on a maturity date of August 10, 2028.  The loan may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty in whole or in part, provided that there is no return of loan fees and prepaid financing fees.  The loan is secured by first mortgages and assignments of rents in the properties comprising the Modiv Portfolio and eight other properties held by subsidiaries of GIP SPE that had outstanding loans with Valley. All of the mortgaged properties cross collateralize the loan, and the loan is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership and the subsidiaries of the Company that hold the properties that comprise the Modiv Portfolio. The loan agreement also provides for customary events of default and other customary affirmative and negative covenants that are applicable to GIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, including reporting covenants and restrictions on investments, additional indebtedness, liens, sales of properties, certain mergers, and certain management changes. The Company's President and CEO also entered into a personal, full recourse guarantee with a $7,500,000 cap.

Our President and CEO has also personally guaranteed the repayment of the $10.7 million due under the 7-11 - Washington, DC; Starbucks - South Tampa, FL; and vacant - Huntsville, AL loan as well as the $1.3 million loan secured by the Company's Sherwin-Williams - Tampa, FL property. In addition, our President and CEO has also provided a guaranty of the Company’s nonrecourse carveout liabilities and obligations in favor of the lender for the GSA and PRA Holdings, Inc. - Norfolk, VA mortgage loans ("Bayport loans") with an aggregate principal amount of $11.8 million.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred a guaranty fee expense to our President and CEO of $97,898 recorded to interest expense. A guaranty fee expense of $60,493 incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

On August 9, 2022, we entered a Redemption Agreement with a unit holder. As such, we recorded an other payable - related party in the amount of $2,912,300 upon execution of the Redemption Agreement entered into July 20, 2022 and has since made installment payments of $1,554,920 to date with a remaining balance of $1,357,380 outstanding as of March 31, 2024. 

 

On October 14, 2022, we entered into a loan transaction that is evidenced by a secured non-convertible promissory note to Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, a preferred equity partner and therefore a related party, for $1.5 million that is due on October 14, 2024, and bears a fixed interest rate of 9%, simple interest. Interest is payable monthly. On July 21, 2023, the Company amended and restated the promissory note to reflect an increase in the loan to $5.5 million and extend the maturity date thereof from October 14, 2024 to October 14, 2026. Except for the increase in the amount of the Loan and Note and the extension of the maturity date thereof, no changes were made to the original note. The loan may be repaid without penalty at any time. The loan is secured by the Operating Partnership’s equity interest in its current direct subsidiaries that hold real estate assets pursuant to the terms of a security agreement between the Operating Partnership and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC. 

 

We currently obtain the capital required to primarily invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial net lease real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of equity offerings, debt financings, preferred minority interest obtained from third parties, issuance of Operating Partnership units and from any undistributed funds from our operations. 

 

As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management’s plan to improve the Company’s liquidity and profitability. Our current and anticipated liquidity is less than the principal balance of these obligations. As a result of our recurring losses, our projected cash needs, and our current liquidity, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future funding commitments for at least the next 12 months.

We amortized debt issuance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 to interest expense of approximately $47,780 and $28,865, respectively. The Company did not pay any debt issuance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Each mortgage loan requires the Company to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios as noted above. In addition, two mortgage loans, one encumbered by six properties and requiring a 1.50 DSCR, and another stand alone mortgage loan requiring a 1.50 DSCR, require the Company to maintain a 54% loan to fair market stabilized value ratio. Fair market stabilized value shall be determined by the lender by reference to acceptable guides and indices or appraisals from time to time at its discretion. As of March 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants, with the exception of one project level DSCR covenant for 2510 Walmer Ave. Our Bayport Credit Union loan covenant requires project level, property level and portfolio level DSCR minimum testing. At the project-level, 2510 Walmer Ave tested at a 1.17:1 DSCR, compared with the 1.25:1 project level minimum DSCR, driven by its vacancy since January 2023. According to the governing loan document, failing to meet DSCR coverage requirements is a technical default triggering the risk of forfeiture of the property, accelerating the repayment of the remaining outstanding balance of the loan at the lender's discretion. All other DSCR covenants tested compliant and the lender has indicated no intention of action. Additionally, a new lease was executed for 2510 Walmer Ave. on March 28, 2024 and will restore the property to full occupancy upon commencement on May 1, 2024.  

Minimum required principal payments on our debt as of March 31, 2024 are as follows:

On February 8, 2023, we entered into new Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreements for the Norfolk, Virginia properties, GIPVA 2510 Walmer Ave, LLC ("GIPVA 2510") and GIPVA 130 Corporate Blvd, LLC ("GIPVA 130"), in which we, as the sole member of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130, admitted a new preferred member, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC, through the issuance of preferred membership interests in the form of Class A Preferred Units of GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130.  GIPVA 2510 and GIPVA 130 (the “Virginia SPEs”) hold our Norfolk, Virginia properties.  In addition, both of the Virginia SPEs and Brown Family Enterprises, LLC entered into Unit Purchase Agreements in which GIPVA 2510 issued and sold 180,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,800,000, and GIPVA 130 issued and sold 120,000 Class A Preferred Units at a price of $10.00 per unit for an aggregate price of $1,200,000. The Operating Partnership is the general manager of the subsidiary while Brown Family Enterprises, LLC is a preferred equity member. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay the preferred equity member a 7% IRR paid on a monthly basis and will share in 16% of the equity in each of the Virginia SPEs upon a capital transaction resulting in distributable proceeds. After 24 months, Brown Family Enterprises, LLC has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value. Because of the redemption right, the non-controlling interest is presented as temporary equity at an aggregated redemption value of $3,000,000 as of March 31, 2024.      

In connection with the acquisition of the Modiv Portfolio, the Operating Partnership and LC2 entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for GIP SPE (the “GIP SPE Operating Agreement”) pursuant to which LC2 made a $12.0 million initial capital contribution to GIP SPE,  together  with a commitment to make an additional $2.1 million contribution upon the satisfactory completion of the acquisition of a tenant-in-common interest held by a third party in the Company’s Rockford, Illinois property (the “LC2 Investment”).  The Company completed the acquisition of such tenant-in-common interest on September 7, 2023, for a purchase price of $1.3 million and LC2 made the additional $2.1 million capital contribution on September 11, 2023. LC2 made the LC2 Investment in exchange for a preferred equity interest in GIP SPE (the “Preferred Interest”). The Preferred Interest has a cumulative accruing distribution preference of 15.5% per year, compounded monthly, a portion of which in the amount of 5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “current preferred return,” and the remainder of which in the amount of 10.5% per annum (compounded monthly) is deemed to be the “accrued preferred return.” The GIP SPE operating agreement provides that operating distributions by GIP SPE will be made first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid current preferred return, with the balance being paid to the Operating Partnership, unless the “annualized debt yield” of GIP SPE is less than 10%, in which case the balance will be paid to LC2. For this purpose, “annualized debt yield” is calculated as the sum of senior debt and LC2 Investment divided by the trailing three-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) of GIP SPE. The GIP SPE Operating Agreement also provides that distributions from capital transactions will be paid first to LC2 to satisfy any accrued but unpaid preferred return, then to LC2 until the “Make-Whole Amount” (defined as the amount equal to 1.3 times the LC2 Investment) is reduced to zero, and then to the Operating Partnership.      

29



 

The Preferred Interest is required to be redeemed in full by the Company on or before August 10, 2025 for a redemption amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the LC2 Investment plus the accrued preferred return, and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount.  Upon a failure to timely redeem the Preferred Interest, the preferred return will accrue at an increased rate of 18% per annum, compounded monthly. The Company will have the right to extend the Mandatory Redemption Date for two consecutive 12-month extension periods, provided that (i) LC2 is paid an extension fee of 0.01% of the outstanding amount of the LC2 Investment for each such extension, (ii) the preferred return is increased from 15.5% to 18% of which the accrued preferred return is increased from 10.5% to 13%, (iii) the trailing 6-month annualized adjusted net operating income (as defined in the GIP SPE Operating Agreement) is in excess of $5.0 million, (iv) GIP SPE and its subsidiaries’ senior debt is extended through the end of the extension period, and there are no defaults under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement.         

Under the GIP SPE Operating Agreement, GIP SPE is also required to pay to Loci Capital, an affiliate of LC2, an equity fee of 1.5% of the LC2 Investment, with 1% having been paid upon the execution and delivery of the GIP SPE Operating Agreement and the 0.5% payable upon redemption of the LC2 Investment.         

Due to the redemption right, the Preferred Interest is presented as temporary equity at redemption value of $14,100,000 plus accrued but unpaid preferred interest of $1,288,726 as of March 31, 2024.       

Each of the preferred members described above may redeem their interest on or after the Redemption date (second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition), at the discretion of such preferred member, as applicable, all or a portion thereof, of such preferred member’s pro-rata share of the redemption value in the form of the units of the Operating Partnership ("GIP LP Units"). Such GIP LP Units shall be subject to all such restrictions, such as with respect to transferability, as reasonably imposed by the Operating Partnership. The number of GIP LP Units issued to any preferred member shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the redemption value that such preferred member shall receive in GIP LP Units by a 15% discount of the average 30-day market price of Generation Income Properties, Inc. common stock. GIP LP Units shall then be convertible into common stock of Generation Income Properties, Inc. on a 1:1 basis in accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has the right to redeem the preferred equity at redemption value with cash after the second year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.

The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility using retained cash flows, long-term debt and common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. We intend to have a lower-leveraged portfolio over the long-term after we have acquired an initial substantial portfolio of diversified investments. During the period when we are acquiring our current portfolio, we will employ greater leverage on individual assets (that will also result in greater leverage of the current portfolio) in order to quickly build a diversified portfolio of assets. 

 

 

Cash from Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $25,977 and net cash used in operating activities was $850,964 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to the doubling of the number of the Company's income generating assets through the 13 property Modiv acquisition. 

Cash from Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0. Net cash used in investing activities was $50,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to an escrow deposit for a property purchase. 

Cash from Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was $1,487,603 and $80,387 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is due to several factors comprising the increase of mortgage principal repayments driven by the Modiv acquisition in August 2023, the increase in distributions to non-controlling interests, and dividend payments on both preferred and common stock. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 

30



 

Our reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also disclose funds from operations ("FFO"), adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), core funds from operations ("Core FFO") and core adjusted funds of operations ("Core AFFO") all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. 

 

FFO and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 

 

We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude non-recurring or extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets, and real estate related depreciation and amortization, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We then adjust FFO for non-cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs, above and below market lease intangible amortization, straight line rent adjustment where the Company is both the lessor and lessee, and non-cash stock compensation to calculate Core AFFO. 

 

FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. We believe that Core FFO and Core AFFO are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non-cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations. We use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. 

 

As FFO excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and non-recurring or extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, FFO does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non-controlling interests.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. See our audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Management, with the participation of our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

 

(a)Sales of Unregistered Securities.

None.

(b)Use of Proceeds.

On September 2, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Maxim Group LLC on behalf of itself and as representative of the underwriters named therein (the “Underwriting Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, in an underwritten public offering (the “Public Offering”), 1,500,000 units consisting of one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Common Stock”), and one warrant exercisable for one share of Common Stock (the “Investor Warrants”). The units were sold to the public at the price of $10.00 per unit and were offered by the Company pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-235707), which was declared effective on September 2, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”). The shares of Common Stock and Investor Warrants comprising the units began separate trading 31 days from the date the registration statement was declared effective. On September 8, 2021, the Public Offering closed, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $15,000,000, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company also granted to the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 225,000 units.  On September 30, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 165,000 units, generating gross proceeds of $1,650,000. The Company received total net proceeds in the Public Offering of approximately $13.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of approximately $2.9 million incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or offering expenses were incurred or paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10% or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates.

The Investor Warrants issued in the Public Offering entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price equal to $10.00 upon the first separate trading day of the warrants for a period of five years.  The Investor Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement available for the resale of the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. In addition, after 120 days after the Investor Warrants are issued, any Investor Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis for 10% of the shares of common stock underlying the Investor Warrant if the volume-weighted average trading price of the Company’s shares of common stock on Nasdaq is below the then-effective exercise price of the Investor Warrant for 10 consecutive trading days.

 

The Company agreed to an underwriting discount of 9% of the public offering price of the Units sold in the Public Offering. In addition, the Company issued to Maxim Group LLC (or its designee) warrants to purchase 149,850 shares of Common Stock, which is equal to an aggregate of 9% of the number of shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering (the “Representative’s Warrants”). The Representative’s Warrants have an exercise price equal to $12.50, which is 125% of the offering price in the Public Offering. The Representative’s Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and will be exercisable six months following the closing date and until September 2, 2026.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has used $1.1 million proceeds from the Public Offering to date for repayment of related party debt.

 

There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the Public Offering as described in our final prospectus, dated September 2, 2021 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act.

(c)None.
