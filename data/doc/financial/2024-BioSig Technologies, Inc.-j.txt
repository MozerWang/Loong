NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Business and organization

 

BioSig Technologies, Inc. was initially incorporated on February 24, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada and subsequently re-incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2011. The Company is principally devoted to improving the standard care in electrophysiology with our PURE EP System’s enhanced signal acquisition, digital signal processing, and analysis during ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. The Company has generated minimal revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in business enterprises in early commercialization stage.

 

On November 7, 2018, the Company formed a subsidiary under the laws of the State of Delaware originally under the name of NeuroClear Technologies, Inc. which was renamed to ViralClear Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ViralClear”) in March 2020. The subsidiary was established to pursue additional applications of the PURE EP™ signal processing technology outside of cardiac electrophysiology, and subsequently in 2020, was repurposed to develop merimepodib, a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent that showed potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Since late 2020, ViralClear has been realigned with its original objective of pursuing additional applications of the PURE EP™ signal processing technology outside of cardiac electrophysiology.

 

In 2019 and 2020, ViralClear sold an aggregate of 1,965,240 shares of its common stock to investors for net proceeds of $15.6 million and issued an aggregate of 894,869 shares of its common stock in connection with acquiring assets and with know-how agreements. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a majority interest in ViralClear of 69.08%.

 

On July 2, 2020, the Company formed an additional subsidiary, NeuroClear Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was renamed to BioSig AI Sciences, Inc. (“BioSig AI”) on May 31, 2023. The subsidiary was established to pursue clinical needs of cardiac and neurological disorders through recordings and analyses of action potentials. BioSig AI aims to contribute to the advancements of AI-based diagnoses and therapies. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a majority interest in BioSig AI of 84.5% (see Notes 9 and 11).

 

On January 28, 2024 and February 20, 2024, management of the Company commenced a workforce reduction intended to reduce significantly the annual cash burn which was completed as of February 20, 2024. The workforce reduction consisted of the departure of sixteen employees, effective as of January 31, 2024 and included the departure of John Sieckhaus, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, and Gray Fleming, the Company’s Chief Commercial Officer and twenty-six employees effective February 20, 2024. The effect of the workforce reductions has significantly reduced operations in the short term. In connection with workforce reduction, the Company issued an aggregate of 85,244 shares of common stock with a fair value of $72,065 as severance.

 

On March 5, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the Company’s common stock did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day cure period under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(2) because the Company does not comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and that accordingly, Nasdaq would delist the Company’s common stock unless the Company requested an appeal of this determination. On March 11, 2024, the Company submitted a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Staff’s delisting determination.

 

On March 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff stating that based upon the Staff’s review of the Company and pursuant to Listing Rule 5101, the Staff believes that the Company no longer has an operating business and is a “public shell,” and that the continued listing of its securities is no longer warranted, in view of work force reductions and resignations of members of the board of directors and officers (see below).

 

                                                                   8

The letter further stated that the Company no longer meets the requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities of $35 million, if none of the other standards set forth in Rule 5550(b) is met.

 

The Staff stated that the foregoing matters serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market, and that the Hearings Panel will consider this matter in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

 

The Company appealed the foregoing determinations. The requested hearing before the Hearings Panel was held on May 7, 2024 and results are pending as of May 17, 2024. The Company believes we have met all requirements except for the shareholder equity requirement which it expects to meet shortly. The delisting results are pending the Company meeting requirements.

 

Delisting from Nasdaq Stock Market could negatively impact the Company’s ability to raise additional financing to fund future operations.

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BioSig Technologies, Inc., and its majority owned subsidiaries, ViralClear and BioSig AI.

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements.

 

Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Company’s Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2024.

 

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S LIQUIDITY PLANS

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $0.4 million and working capital deficit of $4.5 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company used net cash in operating activities of $1.3 million. These balances create a liquidity concern, which in turn raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from sale of equity securities and issuance of debt. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.

 

The Company’s plans include the continued commercialization of the PURE EP System and other applications of our core technology and raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. The Company’s strategic shift to potentially hiring a team of an additional 4-6 persons to execute a business development strategy of finding partners for the commercialization of PURE EP, develop new products in the field of Pulse Field Ablation and to continue to integrate PURE EP into today’s lab equipment will allow the Company to significantly reduce operating expenses.

 

The Company will require additional financing to fund future operations. Further, although the Company began commercial operations, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company’s continuing research and development will be successfully completed or that any additional products will be commercially viable.

 

                                                                   9

Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On January 31, 2024, the Company filed a Reverse Stock Split Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effective February 2, 2024. Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split Amendment, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Company accounted for the reverse stock split on a retrospective basis pursuant to ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. All authorized, issued and outstanding common stock, common stock warrants, stock option awards, exercise prices and per share data have been adjusted in these consolidated financial statements, on a retroactive basis, to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. Authorized common and preferred stock was not adjusted because of the reverse stock split.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

Revenue Recognition 

 

The Company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of its medical device, the PURE EP™ System, and well as related support and maintenance services and software upgrade rentals in connection with the system.

 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) for lease components and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) for non-lease components. For medical device sales and software rentals, the Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606.

 

The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

 

Under ASC 606, the Company determines revenue recognition through the following five steps:

 

●    Identify the contract with the customer;

      

●    Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

      

●    Determine the transaction price;

      

●    Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract; and

      

●    Recognize revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

                                                                   10

Performance obligations are the units of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer. If the Company determines that it has not satisfied a performance obligation, it will defer recognition of the revenue until the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied. Once the PURE EP Platform is delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer, our performance obligation is recognized. Support, maintenance, and software upgrade rentals are performance obligations over a defined period and are recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Customers typically purchase these services with the initial sale of the PURE EP Platform and do not have the right to terminate their contracts unless we fail to perform material obligations.

 

The Company may execute more than one contract with a single customer. If so, it is evaluated whether the agreements were negotiated as a package with a single objective, whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance of another agreement, or whether the goods or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation. The conclusions reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related to those arrangements.

 

The Company records accounts receivable for amounts invoiced to customers for which the Company has an unconditional right to consideration as provided under the contractual arrangement. Unbilled receivables, if any, include amounts related to the Company’s contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Deferred revenue includes payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Our unbilled receivables and deferred revenue are reported on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to bill the customer. Deferred revenue is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue.

 

The Company’s unconditional right to consideration for goods and services transferred to the customer is included in accounts receivable, net (if any) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

 

In 2022, the Company entered two leases for our PURE EP Platform at a rate of $4,333 per month each. The term of the leases is for 30 months with an option provided to extend for an additional one year. The leases also have an option to purchase at the end of the lease at the fair market value. The Company accounts for the leases in accordance with ASC 842 and ASC 606.

 

In 2023, the Company entered into a one-year lease for software upgrade. The Company accounts for the lease in accordance with ASC 606.

 

The Company determined the leases meet the criteria of a sales-type lease whereby the present value of the future expected revenue (less the present value of the estimated unguaranteed residual value), cost of sales and profit and loss are recognized at the lease inception. Non-lease components are recognized under ASC 606. The discount rate utilized was the contract explicit rate of 2% per annum. (See Note 6 – Lease Receivables).

The Company had one customer which accounts for 93% and 100% of our revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company had three customers representing 33.6%, 30.8% and 35.6% of the outstanding accounts receivable and had three customers which accounts for approximately 62.3%, 19.6% and 18.0% of our outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2023.

 

The Company utilized one contract manufacturer for the manufacture and supply of the PURE EP Platform for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Deferred Costs (Contract acquisition costs)

 

The Company capitalizes initial and renewal sales commissions in the period the commission is earned, which generally occurs when a customer contract is obtained, and amortize deferred commission costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we have deemed to be the contract term. As a practical expedient, the Company expenses sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period of related deferred commission costs would have been one year or less.

 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 

The Company adjusts accounts receivable down to net realizable value with its allowance methodology. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses, aged receivables are analyzed periodically by management. Each identified receivable is reviewed based upon historical collection experience, financial condition of the customer and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof. Corrective action, if necessary, is taken by the Company to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company believes that its reserve is adequate, however results may differ in future periods. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, bad debt expense totaled $0.

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deposits in excess of FDIC limits were $0.2 million and nil, respectively.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-10”) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.

 

                                                                   12

 

 

BIOSIG TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

(unaudited)

 

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”) and ASC 825-10, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.

 

Prepaid Expenses and Vendor Deposits

 

Prepaid expenses and vendor deposits are comprised of prepaid insurance, operating expenses and other prepayments.

 

Leases (lessee)

 

The Company determines if a contractual arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company evaluates and classifies leases as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option which result in an economic penalty. All the Company’s real estate leases are classified as operating leases. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

 

The lease payments included in the present value are fixed lease payments. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on information available at the commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company applies the portfolio approach in applying discount rates to its classes of leases. The operating lease ROU assets include any payments made before the commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not currently have subleases. The Company does not currently have residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants in its leases.

 

Leases (lessor)

 

The Company classifies contractual lease arrangements entered as a lessor as a sales-type, direct financing or operating lease as described in ASC 842-Leases. For sales-type leases, the Company derecognizes the leased asset and recognizes the lease investment on the balance sheet.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition is reflected in earnings.

 

Other Assets:

 

Other assets are comprised of the following:

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 

The Company recognizes an impairment of long-lived assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their remaining lives are less than the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value, which is typically calculated using the discounted cash flow method.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company re-assessed it’s carrying amounts of certain property and equipment due to reduced manufacturing of its commercial products and determined that these carrying amounts exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $253 impairment charge to current operations.

 

The Company did not recognize and record any impairments of long-lived assets used in operations during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Research and Development Costs

 

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (“ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Net Income (loss) Per Common Share

 

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”). Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods as applicable.

 

The computation of basic and diluted loss per share as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period.

 

Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are as follows:

Stock Based Compensation

 

The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award as measured on the grant date. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period.

 

                                                                   14

Income Taxes

 

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes (“ASC 740-10”) for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.

 

Patents, Net

 

The Company capitalizes certain initial asset costs in connection with patent applications including registration, documentation and other professional fees associated with the application. Patent costs incurred prior to the Company’s U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) 510(k) application on March 28, 2018 were charged to research and development expense as incurred. Commencing upon first in-man trials on February 18 and 19, 2019, capitalized costs are amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the lesser of the legal patent term or the estimated life of the product of 20 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded amortization of $4,752 and $4,851 to current period operations, respectively.

 

Warranty

 

The Company generally warrants its products to be free from material defects and to conform to material specifications for a period of up to two (2) years. Warranty expense is estimated based primarily on historical experience and is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

 

Segment Information

 

Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance. The information disclosed herein represents all of the material financial information related to the Company’s principal operating segments. (See Note 13 – Segment Reporting).

 

Non-controlling Interest

 

The Company’s non-controlling interest represents the non-controlling shareholders ownership interests related to the Company’s subsidiaries, ViralClear and BioSig AI. The Company reports its non-controlling interest in subsidiaries as a separate component of equity in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and reports both net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest and net loss attributable to the Company’s common shareholders on the face of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s equity interest in ViralClear and BioSig AI is 69.08% and 84.48%; and the non-controlling stockholders’ interest is 30.92% and 15.52%, respectively as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

NOTE 6 – LEASE RECEIVABLES 

 

In 2022, the Company entered into two leases for our PURE EP Platform at a rate of $4,333 per month each. The term of the leases is for 30 months with an option provided to extend for an additional one year. The leases also have an option to purchase at the end of the lease at the fair market value.

 

The Company determined the leases meet the criteria of a sales-type lease whereby the present value of the future expected revenue (less the present value of the estimated unguaranteed residual value), cost of sales and profit and loss are recognized at the lease inception. The discount rate utilized was the contract explicit rate of 2% per annum. The present value of the unguaranteed residual assets of $4 are included in net investment in leases in the balance sheet.

NOTE 10 – OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND WARRANTS

 

BioSig Technologies, Inc.

 

2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan 

 

On December 27, 2022, the Board of Directors of BioSig Technologies, Inc. approved the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”). The 2023 Plan provides for the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to purchase up to 876,595 shares, plus any prior plan awards of the Company’s common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company. Under the terms of the Plan the Company may issue Incentive Stock Options as defined by the Internal Revenue Code to employees of the Company only and nonstatutory options. The Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof administers the Plan and determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the Plan.

 

However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option should not be less than 110% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more stockholder and 100% of fair value for a grantee who is not 10% stockholder. The fair value of the common stock is determined based on the quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the administrator in good faith.

 

Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the Plan will be determined by the administrator, in its sole discretion, with an expiration period of not more than ten years. At March 31, 2024, there were 259,968 shares available under the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

ViralClear Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 

2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan 

 

On September 24, 2019, ViralClear’s Board of Directors approved the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as subsequently amended, the “ViralClear Plan”). The ViralClear Plan was approved by BioSig as ViralClear’s majority stockholder. The ViralClear Plan provides for the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of ViralClear’s common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants of the ViralClear. Under the terms of the ViralClear Plan, ViralClear may issue Incentive Stock Options as defined by the Internal Revenue Code to employees of ViralClear only and nonqualified options. The Board of Directors of ViralClear or a committee thereof (the “Administrator”) administers the ViralClear Plan and determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the ViralClear Plan.

 

However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option should not be less than 110% of fair market value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more stockholder and 100% of fair market value for a grantee who is not 10% stockholder. The fair market value of the common stock is determined based on the quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Administrator in good faith.

 

Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the ViralClear Plan will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with an expiration period of not more than ten years. There are 2,650,071 shares remaining available for future issuance of awards under the terms of the ViralClear Plan.

Litigation

 

Threatened litigation.

 

On December 4, 2023, the Company received a threat of litigation for the termination of employment with the Company alleging the termination of employment was in retaliation for bringing to the attention of the Company’s board of directors and executives a series of wrongful and questionable practices by members of the Company’s board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The claimant sought compensation of in the amount of $775,782. After an investigation conducted by the Board and guidance of legal counsel, it was concluded that the claim was without merit.

 

On February 22, 2024, the Company received a threat of litigation seeking restitution for losses resulting from unlawful actions taken by the Company’s board of directors. The claimant contends that he and others have sustained losses totaling $1,440,000. On March 22, 2024, the claimant sent another letter to the Company referencing the previous letter and requesting several documents. The Company believes that these claims are without merit.

 

On March 22, 2024, plaintiff, Michael Gray Fleming (the “Plaintiff”), filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County, Minnesota District Court naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer as defendants. The Plaintiff contends that the Company failed to meet its obligations in issuing the Plaintiff stock certificates at the end of the restricted period under the terms of a restricted stock award agreement, and is seeking $144,000 in damages and compensation for damages reasonably believed to exceed $50,000. The Company’s intent is to contest the allegations vigorously and, as of the date of this report, is unable to provide an evaluation of the outcome of the litigation within the probate or remote range or to provide an estimate of the amount of or a range of potential loss that might be incurred by the Company.

 

We may be subject at times to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 

There are no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder of more than 5% of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

 

                                                                   26

On March 5, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the Company’s common stock did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day cure period under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(2) because the Company does not comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and that accordingly, Nasdaq would delist the Company’s common stock unless the Company requested an appeal of this determination. On March 11, 2024, the Company submitted a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Staff’s delisting determination.

 

On March 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff stating that based upon the Staff’s review of the Company and pursuant to Listing Rule 5101, the Staff believes that the Company no longer has an operating business and is a “public shell,” and that the continued listing of its securities is no longer warranted, in view of work force reductions and resignations of members of the board of directors and officers (see below).

 

The letter further stated that the Company no longer meets the requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities of $35 million, if none of the other standards set forth in Rule 5550(b) is met.

 

The Staff stated that the foregoing matters serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market, and that the Hearings Panel will consider this matter in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

 

The Company appealed the foregoing determinations. The requested hearing before the Hearings Panel was held on May 7, 2024 and results are pending as of May 17, 2024.

 

On May 6, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff stating that the Company has regained compliance with the bid price requirements in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price of the common stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for a period of 20 consecutive business days, from April 8, 2024 to May 3, 2024.

 

Delisting from Nasdaq Stock Market could negatively impact the Company’s ability to raise additional financing to fund future operations.

 

Private Placement:

 

On May 1, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investors an aggregate of 783,406 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $1.4605 per share, and warrants to purchase up to 391,703 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.398 per share, that will become exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance, in exchange for aggregate consideration of $1,144,164, including $634,999 in cash and $509,165 representing conversion of the principal balance of and accrued interest on the previously issued related party note payable. The note was not convertible by its terms, but the holder has agreed to convert it into shares of common stock and warrants under the Purchase Agreement as described above. (See Note 8).

Results of Operations (000’s)

 

We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development and commercialization efforts, the timing and outcome of future regulatory submissions and uncertainty around the current pandemic. Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 (000’s)

 

Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $14, comprised of recognized service revenue, as compared to $5, comprised of recognized service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of our medical device, PURE EP Platform, as well as related support and maintenance services and software upgrades in connection with the device.

 

We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases for lease components and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) for non-lease components. For medical device sales, we recognize revenue under ASC 606.

 

The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

 

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $238, a decrease of $824, or 77.6%, from $1,062 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in payroll, consulting, Data/AI development and research and clinical studies and design work to $213 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $1,001 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily in the BioSig Technologies segment, a decrease of $788 or 78.7%.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

Research and development expenses were comprised of the following:

 

Three months ended:

 

                                                                                March 31,               March 31,

Travel, supplies, other                                                                      23                     49 

Total                                                                     $                 238   $              1,062 

 

Stock based compensation for research and development personnel was $(58) and $90 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2882, a decrease of $3,363 or 53.9%, from $6,245 incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee and service provider (stock-based) performance pay in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year and additional service provider fees paid.

 

Payroll related expenses decreased to $541 in the current period from $2,086 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,545, or 74.1%. The decrease was primarily due to reduced staff in commercialization, sales and general and administration in the BioSig Technologies segment. We incurred $1,119 in stock-based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock and stock options issued to board members, officers, employees and consultants for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $2,044 in stock-based compensation for the same period in 2023.

 

Professional services for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $262, a decrease of $160, or 37.9%, over the $422 recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Of professional services, legal fees totaled $158 for the three months ended March 31, 2024; a decrease of $109, or 40.8%, from $267 incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in legal fees are primarily due to lower costs incurred in 2024 for contract work and patent filings for the BioSig Technologies segment as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Accounting fees incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to $49, a decrease of $27, or 35.5%, from $76 incurred in same period last year. In 2023, we incurred added accounting fees relating to financing in our BioSig Technologies segment.

 

Consulting, public and investor relations fees for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $225 as compared to $945 incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $720, or 76.2%. The decrease primarily related to a reduction in investor relations, marketing and consulting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period, last year.

 

Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $29, a decrease of $170, or 85.4%, from $199 incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023. Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to business development and financing. The decrease in 2024 was due to staff reductions in 2024 as compared to 2022.

 

Rent for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 both totaled $92.

 

Impairment of Long Term Assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company re-assessed it’s carrying amounts of certain property and equipment due to reduced manufacturing of its commercial products and determined that these carrying amounts exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $254 impairment charge to current operations.

 

                                                                   32

 

 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $78, a decrease of $6, or 7.1%, over the expense of $84 incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023, as a result aging of equipment.

 

Preferred Stock Dividend. Preferred stock dividend for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $135, an increase of $133 over the expense of $2 incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023. Preferred stock dividends are related to the dividends accrued on our Series C Preferred Stock issued during the period from 2013 through 2015. In addition, the Series C Preferred stock conversion rate reset from $2.50 to $0.5302 in during the three months ended March 31, 2024, therefore we recorded a noncash deemed preferred stock dividend of $133 in the current period.

 

Net Loss Attributable to BioSig Technologies, Inc. Common Shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $3,537 compared to a net loss of $7,334 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Summary Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 are detailed in Note 13 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern ($000’s)

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of $4,492, comprised of cash of $416, accounts receivable of $14, current portion of net investments in leases of $90 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $220, which was offset by $4,821 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued dividends on preferred stock issuances of $103 and of current portion of lease liability of $308. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we used $1,314 of cash in operating activities and nil of cash in investing activities.

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 (000’s)

 

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,540, comprised of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants, net of expenses, of $1,040 and proceeds from issuance of a related party note of $500.

 

In the comparable period in 2023, our aggregate cash provided by financing activities totaled $6,748 comprised of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants. At March 31, 2024, we had cash of $416 compared to $1,412 at March 31, 2023. Our cash is held in bank deposit accounts. At March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, we had no convertible debentures outstanding.

 

Cash used in operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1,314 and $5,648, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods. The decreases in cash outlays principally resulted in reduced operating costs, general and administrative expenses in 2024 and with net decreases in our operating assets of $38 and a net increase in our operating liabilities of $332.

 

We used nil cash for investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $45 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. For the comparable period, we purchased computers and other equipment.

 

                                                                   33

 

 

We had an accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024 of $248.0 million, as well as a net loss attributable to BioSig of $3.4 million and negative operating cash flows. We expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our products (primarily PURE EP Platform) reach full commercial profitability.

 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation is that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations. Although we have commercial products available for sale, we have not generated significant revenues to date, and there is no assurance that we will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully completed or that any additional products will be approved or commercially viable. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans from various financial institutions or being awarded grants from government agencies, where possible. Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful. Additionally, with our reduction in staff, our planned commercialization may be further delayed.

 

Our plans include the continued commercialization of the PURE EP System and other applications of our core technology and raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. Our shift from a focus on technology development to commercialization has allowed us to reduce our annual expenses in a meaningful way. As a result of this transition, we have been able to achieve savings through reductions in executive and management compensation and a reduction of our utilization of external consultants and professional service providers. We believe these cost-saving measures combined with our expectations of positive trends in commercial activity create the potential for us to achieve a lower cash flow breakeven rate. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and continues to result in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty in recent months. In addition, U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

 

A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital and on the market price of our common stock, and we may not be able to successfully raise capital through the sale of our securities.

 

Our Series C Preferred Stock contains triggering events which would, among other things, require redemption (i) in cash, at the greater of (a) 120% of the stated value of $1 or (b) the product of (I) the variable weighted average price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the triggering event and (II) the stated value divided by the then conversion price or (ii) in shares of our common stock, equal to a number of shares equal to the amount set forth in (i) above divided by 75%. As of March 31, 2024, the aggregate stated value of our Series C Preferred Stock was $105. The triggering events include our being subject to a judgment of greater than $100 or our initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. If any of the triggering events contained in our Series C Preferred Stock occur, the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock may demand redemption, an obligation we may not have the ability to meet at the time of such demand. We will be required to pay interest on any amounts remaining unpaid after the required redemption of our Series C Preferred Stock, at a rate equal to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

 

We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We expect to incur additional marketing and commercialization expenses related to our PURE EP system in addition to additional research and development costs relating to the PURE EP and other product candidates, including expenses related to clinical trials. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.

 

Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.

 

                                                                   34

 

 

Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our securities.

 

If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

 

Equity Financing

 

On January 12, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited and institutional investors, pursuant to which we sold to the investors an aggregate of 260,720 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 130,363 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $3.989 per share and a warrant to purchase one-half of a share. The warrants have an exercise price of $3.364 per share, will become exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance. The gross proceeds from this offering were $1,040,000.

 

On May 1, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we sold to the Investors an aggregate of 783,406 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.4605 per share, and warrants to purchase up to 391,703 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.398 per share, that will become exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance, in exchange for aggregate consideration of $1,144,164, including $634,999 in cash and $509,165 representing conversion of the principal balance of and accrued interest on the previously issued related party note payable. The note was not convertible by its terms, but the holder has agreed to convert it into shares of common stock and warrants under the purchase agreement as described above. (See Below).

 

Issuance of Debt

 

On March 7, 2024, we issued a promissory note to an investor and an affiliate (10% or more shareholder) for $500,000. We designated its 12% note due 2026, in accordance with exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

 

The note is due March 7, 2026. We promise to pay interest in cash on the unpaid principal amount of this note at a rate per annum equal to twelve percent (12%), commencing to accrue on the date hereof and payable on the maturity date or earlier prepayment as provided therein. The Note contains customary events of default.

 

We may prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of the Note at any time or from time to time without penalty.

 

On May 1, 2024, we converted the promissory note and related accrued interest of $509,165 into 348,624 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 174,312 shares of common stock at $1.398 per share, that will become exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance.

 

                                                                   35

 

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include estimates based on currently available information and our judgment as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances.

 

We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Among the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of our financial statements are the following:

 

Stock Based Compensation

 

We estimate the fair value of options and stock warrants granted using the Black Scholes Merton model. We estimate when and if performance-based awards will be earned. If an award is not considered probable of being earned, no amount of equity-based compensation expense is recognized. If the award is deemed probable of being earned, related equity-based compensation expense is recorded. The fair value of an award ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods in our statements of operations, which is generally the vesting period of the award.

 

The Black Scholes Merton model requires the input of certain subjective assumptions and the application of judgment in determining the fair value of the awards. The most significant assumptions and judgments include the expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, and the expected term of the awards. In addition, the recognition of equity-based compensation expense is impacted by our forfeitures, which are accounted for as they occur.

 

The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

 

All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period. Restricted stock payments and stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.

 

Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached, or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not required under Regulation S-K for “smaller reporting companies.”

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 

                                                                   36

 

 

Based on management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective in providing reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of the assets of the

           company;

           

     (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made

           in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;

           and

           

     (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

           company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

           statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures.

 

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company’s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024, because management identified that i) inadequate identification, recording and reporting of stock based compensation, ii) ineffective review processes over period end financial disclosure and reporting, and (iii) inadequate segregation of duties for transaction posting and processing, amounted to a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   37

 

 

The material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to the consolidated financial statements and there were no changes to previously released financial results.

 

Management’s Remediation Plan

 

In 2024, we have intents to add sufficient staff and oversight supervision controls to provide adequate accounting segregation. We believe these changes will remediate the underlying deficiencies as identified by us. The remediation efforts will include an ongoing review of the implementation of additional controls to ensure all risks have been addressed.

 

As a result of the material weaknesses discussed above or of others, we may experience negative impacts on our ability to accurately report our results of operation and financial condition in a timely manner. If we do identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and are unsuccessful in implementing or following a remediation plan, or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves or to integrate acquired businesses into our controls system, if additional material weaknesses are found in our internal controls in the future, or if our external auditors cannot attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial review, if applicable, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, an inability for us to be accepted for listing on any national securities exchange in the near future, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our common stock. Further, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. We could face additional litigation exposure and a greater likelihood of an SEC enforcement or other regulatory action if further restatements were to occur or other accounting-related problems emerge.

 

The weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that occurred during our last completed fiscal quarter that has materially negatively affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As discussed above, management has remediation plans that will be implemented in 2024.

 

                                                                   38

 

 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

On December 4, 2023, we received a threat of litigation for the termination of employment with the Company alleging the termination of employment was in retaliation for bringing to the attention of the Company’s board of directors and executives a series of wrongful and questionable practices by members of the Company’s board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The claimant sought compensation of in the amount of $775,782. After an investigation conducted by the Board and guidance of legal counsel, it was concluded that the claim was without merit.

 

On February 22, 2024, we received a threat of litigation seeking restitution for losses resulting from unlawful actions taken by the Company’s board of directors. The claimant contends that he and others have sustained losses totaling $1,440,000. On March 22, 2024, the claimant sent another letter to the Company referencing the previous letter and requesting several documents. The Company believes that these claims are without merit. 

 

On March 22, 2024, plaintiff, Michael Gray Fleming (the “Plaintiff”), filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County, Minnesota District Court naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer as defendants. The Plaintiff contends that the Company failed to meet its obligations in issuing the Plaintiff stock certificates at the end of the restricted period under the terms of a restricted stock award agreement, and is seeking $144,000 in damages and compensation for damages reasonably believed to exceed $50,000. The Company’s intent is to contest the allegations vigorously and, as of the date of this report, is unable to provide an evaluation of the outcome of the litigation within the probate or remote range or to provide an estimate of the amount of or a range of potential loss that might be incurred by the Company.

 

We may be subject at times to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 

There are no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder of more than 5% of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

 

                                                                   39

 

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

 

The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to risk factors associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.

 

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q.

 

Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.

 

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum bid price, shareholders’ equity, public float and other requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.

 

On March 5, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company has not regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the Company’s common stock did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day cure period under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(2) because the Company does not comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and that accordingly, Nasdaq would delist the Company’s common stock unless the Company requested an appeal of this determination. On March 11, 2024, the Company submitted a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Staff’s delisting determination.

 

On March 12, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff stating that based upon the Staff’s review of the Company and pursuant to Listing Rule 5101, the Staff believes that the Company no longer has an operating business and is a “public shell,” and that the continued listing of its securities is no longer warranted, in view of work force reductions and resignations of members of the board of directors and officers (see below).

 

The letter further stated that the Company no longer meets the requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities of $35 million, if none of the other standards set forth in Rule 5550(b) is met.

 

                                                                   40

 

 

The Staff stated that the foregoing matters serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market, and that the Hearings Panel will consider this matter in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

 

We appealed the foregoing determinations. The requested hearing before the Hearings Panel was held on May 7, 2024 and the results are pending as of May 17, 2024.

 

On May 6, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff stating that the Company has regained compliance with the bid price requirements in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price of the common stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for a period of 20 consecutive business days, from April 8, 2024 to May 3, 2024.

 

On May 17, 2024, the closing price of our Common Shares reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $1.65. We may need to seek to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in order to attempt to continue to comply with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirements, which could occur in the near term, but requires stockholder approval, of which there can be no assurance. We may be unable to complete a reverse stock split, and even if we do, we may still be unable to meet the minimum bid price requirement, and we may be unable to meet other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders’ equity or market values of our common stock.

 

If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained.
