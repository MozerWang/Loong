APPLE iSPORTS GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1. COMPANY HISTORY AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

 

Apple iSports Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1975 as Vita Plus Industries, Inc. In March 1999, the Company sold its remaining inventory and changed its name to Prevention Insurance.com and effective August 31, 2023, changed its name to Apple iSports Group, Inc. Effective March 23, 2023, the Company closed a share exchange pursuant to a Stock Exchange Agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”), with Apple iSports, Inc. (“AiS”), a Delaware corporation and the stockholders of AiS. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, the Company issued to the AiS stockholders 195,062,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (195,062,000 shares of common stock) of AiS. AiS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with this transaction, the Company elected to change its fiscal year end from April 30 to December 31. For financial reporting purposes, the transaction is considered a combination of businesses under common control, as the Company and AiS were commonly controlled, and thus the Company retroactively combined the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of the Company and AiS for all periods presented.

 

AiS, formed on May 29, 2019, in the State of Delaware, has been engaged in the development of an online sports portal that will include, racing and sports betting, fantasy sports, and sports content. On November 9, 2021, AiS incorporated Apple iSports Pty Ltd (“AIS Australia”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of AiS.

 

Paramount Capital Inc., formed on September 19, 2019, in the State of Wyoming with the plan of being a banking arm of the Company. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and since inception, it has had limited operating activity.

 

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN

 

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues and cash flows sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $748,265, negative working capital of $5,287,308, and an accumulated deficit of $11,185,878. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of debt and, or equity to fund the continued development of its multi-faceted sports betting platform and ultimately achieve profitable operations. The Company plans to obtain such resources by relying upon continued advances from significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third-party equity and/or debt financing. However, the Company cannot provide any assurances that it will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

 

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. 

 

These condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, AiS, AIS Australia and Paramount Capital Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional financing needed to execute its business plan. 

 

 

                                                                  F-5



Table of Contents

 

The Company is an emerging growth company as the term is used in The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, enacted on April 5, 2021, and has elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements.

 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information

 

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information, within the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated results for the interim periods presented and of the consolidated financial condition as of the date of the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements related to the three-month periods are unaudited. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023, and notes thereto.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.

 

Intellectual property rights

 

The Company depends in part upon proprietary technology and is actively looking to increase and enhance their proprietary technology through the acquisition of 3rd party intellectual property. As such, in 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to transfer 1,000,000 AUD (U.S. $664,011) in the Company’s shares to a third-party in exchange for certain intellectual property. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company took possession of the intellectual property and commenced a trial period to review the intellectual property; however, the Company determined that the intellectual property was not viable for their operations and returned the intellectual property to the third-party. Since the Company took possession of the intellectual property, it recognized the related expense during the first quarter of 2023; however, subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company and the third-party entered into a binding recission. See Note 9 Subsequent Events for further details. As of March 31, 2024, these shares had not been issued to the third-party and U.S. $664,011 is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

 

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

 

The Company’s functional currency is the United States Dollar (“US $”). The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, AIS Australia’s functional currency in which it operates is Australian Dollars (“AUD”).

 

For the purpose of presenting these condensed consolidated financial statements, the reporting currency is US$. AIS Australia’s assets and liabilities are expressed in US$ at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholder’s equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate during the period The resulting translation adjustments are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholder’s equity section of the balance sheets.

 

 

                                                                  F-6



Table of Contents

 

Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains or losses resulting from transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies are recognized as part of operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.

 

Exchange rates used for the translations are as follows:

 

 AUD to U.S. $                                                                                           Period End      Average     

December 31, 2023                                                                                              0.6812         0.6640 

March 31, 2024                                                                                                 0.6520         0.6589 

March 31, 2023                                                                                                 0.6947         0.7369 

 

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement, and enhances disclosures requirements for fair value measures. Current assets and current liabilities qualified as financial instruments and management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable, their current interest rate is equivalent to interest rates currently available.  The three levels are defined as follow:

 

     ·    Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

           markets.

           

     ·    Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,

           and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term

           of the financial

           instruments.

           

     ·    Level 3 — inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.

 

As of the balance sheet date, the estimated fair values of accounts payable, accrued expenses, loan payable – related parties, and due to related party approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Company’s recently issued notes receivable approximates its carrying value due to the recency of its issuance relative to March 31, 2024, which was otherwise issued at market terms that the Company believes would be currently available for similar loan issuances. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates the hierarchy disclosures each reporting period.

 

Related Party Transactions

 

The Company adopted ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. See Note 4 below for details of related party transactions in the period presented.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company maintains cash balances in a non-interest-bearing account that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. Australian bank accounts are insured with deposit protection up to 250,000 AUD. U.S. bank accounts are insured with deposit protection up to $250,000. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

 

Notes Receivable

 

Notes receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on the Company’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity. Notes receivable are carried at amortized cost and are reduced by loan origination costs and the allowance for estimated credit losses, as necessary. 

 

 

                                                                  F-7



Table of Contents

 

Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for credit losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the loans. In determining expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.

 

The Company recognizes interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectability of the future payments is reasonably assured. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance unless the collectability of the loan is in doubt. Loans are placed on non-accrual status if the collection of principal and interest is considered doubtful, which is typically 90 days after the loan becomes delinquent.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

 

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers

 

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

 

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract

 

Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation

 

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods or services to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or services to customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. 

 

Comprehensive income (loss)

 

The Company follows ASC 220 in reporting comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income (loss). 

 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

 

The Company follows ASC 260 when reporting earnings (loss) per share (EPS) resulting in the presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. Diluted EPS is not presented when its effect is anti-dilutive. Because the Company does not have any common stock equivalents, such as stock options and warrants, the amounts reported for basic and diluted net loss per share were the same.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.

 

 

                                                                  F-8



Table of Contents

 

The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company’s condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period under the Federal tax laws. Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimates.

 

The Company evaluates tax positions in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as long-term liabilities in the financial statements.

 

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This guidance will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 4. NOTES RECEIVABLE

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES

 

The Company utilized the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.

 

a. United States (U.S.)

 

The Company is subject to U.S. tax laws at a tax rate of 21%. No provision for US federal income taxes has been made as the Company had no taxable income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company is subject to the State of Delaware tax laws at a tax rate of 8.7%.

 

 

                                                                  F-10

b. Australia (AU)

 

Apple iSports Pty Ltd, a second-tier subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in Australia in November 2021 and maybe subject to a corporate income tax on its activities conducted in Australia and income arising in or from Australia. No provision for income tax has been made as the subsidiary had no taxable income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The applicable statutory tax rate is 25%.

 

Significant components of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets as of the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and year ended December 31, 2023, consist of net operating loss carryforwards. The net operating loss forward for U.S. federal tax and Australian tax purposes is available for carryforward indefinitely for use in offsetting taxable income. The U.S. federal net operating loss carry forward offset is limited to up to 80% of the taxable income. The State of Delaware net operating loss carryforwards are available for carry forward for 20 years for use in offsetting taxable income. Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period.

 

There is no income tax benefit for the losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, since management has determined that the realization of the net tax deferred asset is not assured and has created a valuation allowance for the entire amount of such benefits.

Forward-Looking Statements

 

Certain statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the registrant will be achieved.

 

The forward-looking statements are not meant to predict or guarantee actual results, performance, events, or circumstances and may not be realized because they are based upon our current projections, plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations, estimates, and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and other influences, many of which we have no control over. Actual results and the timing of certain events and circumstances may differ materially from those described by the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that may influence or contribute to the accuracy of the forward-looking statements or cause actual results to differ materially from expected or desired results may include, without limitation:

 

     ·    Market acceptance of our products and services;

 

     ·    Competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;

 

 

                                                                   4

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because of the risks and uncertainties related to them and to the risk factors. We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this Report to reflect any new information or future events or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law.

Overview

AiS has been engaged in the development of a digital sports betting and gaming platform. Our platform, when complete, will provide users with sports content, racing and sports betting, fantasy sports and sport streaming solutions. We aim to create excitement and engagement and deliver the best experiences that enhance sports fandom. Users can access our products via multiple devices including the web and mobile devices. 

 

AiS is licensed in Australia via a provisional Northern Territory Online Bookmaking License which allows for racing, sports betting, and fantasy sports throughout Australia, which is one of the most mature legal betting markets in the world. In addition, we are licensed in North Dakota as an (ADW) provider, subject to completion of TRPB examination, which will allow us to provide pari-mutuel betting on racing in North Dakota and up to an additional 20 states that do not have specific regulations. NFL and other sports bets in the US are regulated separately from racing wagering and we will seek market access licenses for a number of states offering sports betting licenses over a 3-year timeline.

 

Our two primary markets are the U.S. (in select states where we are licensed) and Australia. We will have separate websites for both markets, namely www.appleisports.com in the U.S. and www.appleisports.com.au in Australia.  

 

We have achieved the following milestones: 

 

     ·    Since the inception of AiS through March 31, 2024, we (i) established a core team with the industry skills and experience to

           manage the Company and (ii) we received approximately $2,000,000 in private placement funding and received loans from

           related parties in excess of

           $2,700,000

     ·    From December 2021 to October 2022, we developed our Go to Market outline and marketing strategy, including identifying

           preferred suppliers for each product and initiating relationships with key suppliers and

           consultants;

    

 

                                                                   5

     ·    In February 2022, we launched a content-rich blog site on the appleisports.com domain and initiated search engine

           optimization activities to increase the search performance of our site on Google

           search;

     ·    In April 2022 we reached an agreement with a leading provider of Australian racing data and form information for use on our

           racing

           platform;

     ·    In April 2022, we completed and submitted our application for a Northern Territory (NT) Online Bookmaking license. We

           appeared before the NT Racing Commission in May 2022 to present our application for approval. We expect the license to be

           issued in Q2

           2024;

     ·    In June 2022, we submitted our application to the North Dakota Racing Commission for an (ADW) license, subject to the

           approval of the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau. In parallel, we initiated a Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau

           (TRPB) examination process. The TRPB provides integrity reporting to regulators administering ADW licenses. We expect the

           TRPB examination to be completed in Q3 2024. Completion of the TRPB examination is required to receive a state-issued

           ADW;

     ·    In October 2022, we engaged a leading provider of white-label sportsbook platforms and began customization and integration

           with key components (KYC, payments, CRM, credit card verification) and data feeds. The expected completion and product

           launch is June

           2024;

     ·    In June 2023, we began User Acceptance Testing of our racing and sport betting platform with the NT Racing Commission. The

           expected completion date is Q2

           2024;

     ·    In July 2023, we entered into a licensing agreement with Seaport, Inc., a technology company, to incorporate their unique

           firmware and software called “IPK.” The objective is to incorporate the IPK technology into our gaming platform and “Casino

           in a Box” offerings that will improve performance by minimizing latency and will incorporate a state-of-the-art algorithm

           that will provide unprecedented security in the industry. , This is especially critical for the delivery of services in

           remote communities throughout the USA including the underserved Native American Nations. The license agreement allows us to

           use the technology in our own platform with the ability to make the product available to other operators in the gaming

           space. We also will make the technology available to other iGaming companies that provide wireless iGaming. We expect to

           launch “Casino in a Box” in Q2

           2024;

     ·    In August 2023, we began engaging with connectivity and communications optimization with third parties and Native

           American-led service providers to develop a Class II online iGaming platform for the tribal casino market in the United

           States. This technology focus has led to the development of partnerships and offerings for gaming operators, both brick and

           mortar and on-line. The expected product launch for the tribal casino market is Q3 2024;

           and

     ·    In January 2024, we began engaging with an establish ISP and networking technologies group regarding provision of broadband

           services to Native American tribal land. This capability, along with the IPK technology, will allow us to deliver the

           infrastructure needed to deploy broadband services that will enable “Casino in a Box” to operate in a sufficiently secure

           and fast manner, anywhere in North America. The expected launch date is Q2

           2024.

  

Effective March 23, 2023, we completed a change of control transaction pursuant to a Stock Exchange Agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”), with AiS and the shareholders of AiS. The stock exchange was accounted for under the business combination under common control of accounting. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the financial statements prior to the stock exchange are those of AiS and the Company combined and are recorded at the historical cost basis and the condensed consolidated financial statements after completion of the stock exchange include the combined assets and liabilities of AiS and the Company from the closing date of the stock exchange. As a result of the issuance of the shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock exchange, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the transaction.

 

Our address is 100 Spectrum Center Dr. Suite 900, Irvine, CA 92612, and our phone number is (949) 247-4210. We also maintain satellite offices at offices at Level 1, Paspalis Centrepoint, 48-50 Smith Street Mall, Darwin NT 0800 Australia and Lonsdale Street, Level 7, Melbourne, Australia 3000.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023.

 

Results of Operations

 

During the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no revenues. During the same periods, the Company had total operating expenses of $729,361 and $1,027,310, respectively. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, operating expenses consisted of corporate expenses of $138,992, consulting, and professional fees of $473,094, and selling, general and administrative expenses of $117,275. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, operating expenses consisted of corporate expenses of $172,102, consulting and professional fees of $123,731, selling, general and administrative expenses of $36,777, and research and development expenses of $694,700. The 29% decrease in operating expenses for the current quarter over the prior quarter is primarily due to decreased operating activity driven by decreases in research and development expenses, offset by increases in consulting and professional fees.

 

During the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, we had $20,001 and $9,772 respectively, in interest expense attributable to related party debt, net of interest income.

 

During the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, we had net loss of $748,265 and $1,040,797, respectively, for the reasons discussed above.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company loaned $50,000 to SeaPort, Inc. By comparison during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company had no cash flows from investing activities.

  

Financing Activities

  

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company received $929,145 from financing activities by way of $281,545 in loans from related parties, and $647,600 from stock issuances.

The Company is dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company or that the related parties will continue to fund the Company’s working capital needs. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have not identified any critical accounting estimates. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results which are found in Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act (“Exchange Act”) as March 31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 

Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information was not accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Due to this material weakness, the Company’s accounting for research and development expense for 2023 was not accurately accounted for and led to the restatement of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023. In addition to the remediation steps discussed below, the Company has added additional steps to its internal financial review process in order to provide reasonable assurance that a reoccurrence of a material misstatement of any item in our financial statements will not occur.

 

Effective disclosure controls and internal control are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weaknesses. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

 

Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. By enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals.

 

If we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.

 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, other than the remediation steps addressed above there have been no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

 

 

                                                                   9
