HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST
 
 
Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1.Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of Hugoton Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present the financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”):
 
-Net profits income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by XTO Energy Inc. (“XTO
  Energy”), the owner of the underlying properties, to Argent Trust Company, as trustee (the “Trustee”)
  for the Trust. XTO Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Net profits income
  consists of net proceeds received by XTO Energy from the underlying properties in the prior month,
  multiplied by a net profits percentage of
  80%.
 
-Costs deducted in the calculation of net proceeds for the 80% net profits interests generally include
  applicable taxes, transportation, marketing and legal costs, production expense, development costs,
  operating charges and other
  costs.
 
-Net profits income is computed separately for each of the three conveyances under which the net profits
  interests were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess
  costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot
  reduce net proceeds from the other
  conveyances.
 
-Interest income and distribution payable to unitholders include interest earned on the previous month’s
  investment.
 
-Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the Trustee for
  liabilities and
  contingencies.
 
-Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trustee.
The Trust’s financial statements differ from those prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP because revenues are recognized when received rather than accrued in the month of production, expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred and certain cash reserves may be established by the Trustee for contingencies which would not be recorded under U.S. GAAP. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the Trust’s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust’s financial statements.
Net profits interests in oil and gas properties
The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $247,066,951 represents XTO Energy’s historical net book value for the interests on December 1, 1998, the date of the transfer to the Trust. During the second quarter 2016, the carrying value of the net profits interests was written down to its fair value of $28,801,000, resulting in an impairment of $57,306,527 charged directly to trust corpus. During the third quarter 2019, the carrying value of the net profits interests was written down to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment of $15,681,533 charged directly to trust corpus. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on a unit-of-production basis using proved reserves and is charged

directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $174,078,891 as of September 30, 2019, when the net profits interests was written down to its fair value of zero.
Liquidity and Going Concern
The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Trust will continue as a going concern. Financial statements prepared on a going concern basis assume the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accumulated excess costs for the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming conveyances have resulted in insufficient net proceeds to the Trust and a reduction in the Trust’s expense reserve. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Trust’s ability to continue as a going concern as the Trust does not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations during the one-year period after the dates that the financial statements are issued. Factors attributable to the cash shortage are primarily the previously disclosed development costs to drill four non-operated wells in Major County, Oklahoma, lower oil and natural gas prices, and excess cost positions on the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming conveyances including accumulated interest, which have resulted in no unitholder distributions since July 2023. In addition, on May 18, 2021, the arbitration panel issued its second interim final award over the amount of XTO Energy’s settlement in the Chieftain class action lawsuit that can be charged to the Trust as a production cost which XTO Energy has estimated to be approximately $14.6 million net to the Trust. This adjustment would further increase excess costs on the Oklahoma conveyance. The Trustee has prepared a preliminary budget estimating the administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2024, and the five months ending May 31, 2025, which assumes no cash inflow from either net profits income or from other sources. The Trustee intends to review options for the Trust which may include alternatives to continuing as a going concern or may include seeking financing to pay the Trust obligations during the one-year period after the date the financial statements are issued; however, there can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If financing became available to the Trust, it would have to be repaid, together with interest, and the Trust’s expense reserve would have to be replenished prior to any distributions to unitholders.
On July 9, 2020, the Trustee notified XTO Energy of the Trustee’s claim to indemnification to the Trust Estate for all liability, expense, claims, damages or loss incurred by the Trustee in connection with the administration of the Trust. The Trustee stated it anticipates seeking reimbursement from XTO Energy upon depletion of the Trust’s cash reserve. XTO Energy responded that any indemnity claim to XTO Energy is premature before the Trust Estate is exhausted.
The Trust’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
2.Income Taxes
For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment trust that is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the financial statements. The unitholders are considered to own the Trust’s income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust and not when distributed by the Trust. Impairments recorded for book purposes will not result in a loss for tax purposes for the unitholders until the loss is recognized.
All revenues from the Trust are from sources within Kansas, Oklahoma or Wyoming. Because it distributes all of its net income to unitholders, the Trust has not been taxed at the trust level in Kansas or Oklahoma. While the Trust has not owed tax, the Trustee is generally required to file Kansas and Oklahoma income tax returns reflecting the income and deductions of the Trust attributable to properties located in each state, along with a schedule that includes information regarding distributions to unitholders. 
Wyoming does not impose a state income tax.  
The Trust may be required to bear a portion of the settlement costs arising from the Chieftain royalty class action settlement. For information on contingencies, including the Chieftain class action, see Note 3 to Condensed Financial Statements. The Panel has determined the Trust is responsible for a portion of the costs. Pending finalization of all claims included in the arbitration, XTO Energy would have the right to deduct the costs in its calculation of the net profits

income payable to the Trust from the applicable net profits interests. Thus, for unitholders, the portion of legal settlement costs for which the Trust is determined to be responsible will be reflected through a reduction in net profits income received from the Trust and thus in a reduction in the gross royalty income reported by and taxable to the unitholders. In the event that the Trustee objects to such claimed reductions, the Trustee may also incur legal fees in representing the Trust’s interests. For unitholders, such costs would be reflected through an increase in the Trust’s administrative expenses, which would be deductible by unitholders in determining the net royalty income from the Trust.
Each unitholder should consult their own tax advisor regarding income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such person’s ownership of Trust units.
Unitholders should consult the Trust’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of federal and state tax matters.
3.Contingencies
Litigation
Royalty Class Action and Arbitration
As previously disclosed, XTO Energy advised the Trustee that it reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the Chieftain class action royalty case. On July 27, 2018, the final plan of allocation was approved by the court. Based on the final plan of allocation, XTO Energy advised the Trustee that it believes approximately $24.3 million in additional production costs should be allocated to the Trust. On May 2, 2018, the Trustee submitted a demand for arbitration seeking a declaratory judgment that the Chieftain settlement is not a production cost and that XTO Energy is prohibited from charging the settlement as a production cost under the conveyance or otherwise reducing the Trust’s payments now or in the future as a result of the Chieftain litigation. The Trust and XTO Energy conducted the interim hearing on the claims related to the Chieftain settlement on October 12-13, 2020. In the arbitration, the Trustee contended that the approximately $24.3 million allocation related to the Chieftain settlement was not a production cost and, therefore, there should not be a related adjustment to the Trust’s share of net proceeds. However, XTO Energy contended that the approximately $24.3 million was a production cost and should reduce the Trust’s share of net proceeds. 
On January 20, 2021, the arbitration panel issued its Corrected Interim Final Award (i) “reject[ing] the Trust’s contention that XTO has no right under the Conveyance to charge the Trust with amounts XTO paid under section 1.18(a)(i) as royalty obligations to settle the Chieftain litigation” and (ii) stating “[t]he next phase will determine how much of the Chieftain settlement can be so charged, if any of it can be, in the exercise of the right found by the Panel.” Following briefing by both parties, on May 18, 2021, the Panel issued its second interim final award over the amount of XTO Energy’s settlement in the Chieftain class action lawsuit that can be charged to the Trust as a production cost. The Panel in its decision has ruled that out of the $80 million settlement, the “Trust is obligated to pay its share under the Conveyance of the $48 million that was received by the plaintiffs in the Chieftain lawsuit by virtue of the settlement of that litigation. The Trust is not obligated by the Conveyance to pay any share of the $32 million received by the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Chieftain lawsuit by virtue of the settlement.” XTO Energy and the Trustee are in the process of determining the portion of the $48 million that is allocable to Trust properties to be charged as an excess cost to the Trust but estimate it to be approximately $14.6 million net to the Trust.
The reduction in the Trust’s share of net proceeds from the portion of the settlement amount the Panel has ruled may be charged against the Oklahoma conveyance would result in excess costs under the Oklahoma conveyance that would likely result in no distributions under the Oklahoma conveyance while these excess costs are recovered. This award completes the portion of the arbitration related to the Chieftain settlement. Excess costs on any individual conveyance would not affect net proceeds to the Trust on any of the other remaining conveyances.
Other Trustee claims related to disputed amounts on the computation of the Trust’s net proceeds for 2014 through 2019 and 2021 were bifurcated from the initial arbitration. Although the arbitration is not terminated, the final hearing regarding the remaining dispute over net proceeds, previously scheduled to occur on November 8, 2023, was cancelled. XTO Energy and the Trustee will provide material updates as they become available.

Other Lawsuits and Governmental Proceedings
Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the Trustee that, based on the information available at this stage of the various proceedings, it does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Trust, but may have an effect on annual distributable income. 
Other
Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from payments made to nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the Trustee believes that it is not required to withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the Trust or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the filing of a claim for refund by the Trust or unitholders for such amount.
4.Excess Costs
If monthly costs exceed revenues for any of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming), such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net proceeds from other conveyances.
The following summarizes excess costs activity, cumulative excess costs balances and accrued interest to be recovered by conveyance as calculated by XTO Energy:

This balance does not include the portion of the Chieftain settlement the Panel determined could be charged as a production cost. XTO Energy has estimated the amount to be approximately $14.6 million net to the Trust.

5.Administration Expense
Administrative expenses are incurred so that the Trustee may meet its reporting obligations to the unitholders and regulatory entities and otherwise manage the administrative functions of the Trust. These obligations include, but are not limited to, all expenses, taxes, compensation to the Trustee for managing the Trust, fees to consultants, accountants, attorneys, transfer agents, other professional and expert persons, expenses for clerical and other administrative assistance, and fees and expenses for all other services.
Item 2.  Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Trustee’s discussion and analysis contained in the Trust’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the condensed financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available on the Trust’s website at www.hgt-hugoton.com.
Distributable Income
For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, net profits income was $0 compared to $10,459,753 for first quarter 2023. This was primarily the result of lower gas and oil prices ($12.7 million), decreased gas production ($0.8 million), increased production expenses ($0.6 million), and increased overhead ($0.2 million), partially offset by decreased taxes, transportation and other costs ($2.0 million), decreased development costs ($0.9 million), increased oil production ($0.6 million), and net excess costs activity ($0.3 million). See “Net Profits Income” below.  
After adding interest income of $4,678, deducting administration expense of $228,423, and utilizing $223,745 of the cash reserve for the payment of Trust expenses, distributable income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $0 or $0.000000 per unit of beneficial interest. Administration expense for the quarter decreased $73,114 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily related to the timing of receipt and payment of Trust expenses and terms of professional services. Changes in interest income are attributable to fluctuations in net profits income, cash reserve and interest rates. For first quarter 2023, distributable income was $10,175,760 or $0.254394 per unit. 
Distributions to unitholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, were: 
      Record Date            Payment Date                Distribution

Net Profits Income
Net profits income is recorded when received by the Trust, which is the month following receipt by XTO Energy, and generally two months after oil and gas production. Net profits income is generally affected by three major factors:
1.oil and gas sales volumes,
2.oil and gas sales prices, and
3.costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income.

(a)Because of the two-month interval between time of production and receipt of net profits income by the Trust, gas and oil sales for the quarter ended March 31 generally represent production for the period November through January.
(b)Gas and oil sales volumes are allocated to the net profits interests by dividing Trust net cash inflows by average sales prices. As gas and oil prices change, the Trust’s allocated production volumes are impacted as the quantity of production necessary to cover expenses changes inversely with price. As such, the underlying property production volume changes may not correlate with the Trust’s allocated production volumes in any given period. Therefore, comparative discussion of gas and oil sales volumes is based on the underlying properties.

The following are explanations of significant variances on the underlying properties from first quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024:
Sales Volumes
Gas
Gas sales volumes decreased 11 percent for first quarter 2024 primarily because of timing of cash receipts and natural production decline, partially offset by gas sales from new wells in Major County, Oklahoma.
Oil
Oil sales volumes increased 25 percent for first quarter 2024 primarily because of oil sales from new wells in Major County, Oklahoma, partially offset by timing of cash receipts and natural production decline.
The estimated rate of natural production decline on the underlying oil and gas properties is approximately six to eight percent a year.  
Sales Prices
Gas
The first quarter 2024 average gas price was $3.80 per Mcf, down 64 percent from the first quarter 2023 average gas price of $10.56 per Mcf. 
Oil
The first quarter 2024 average oil price was $72.17 per Bbl, down 9 percent from the first quarter 2023 average oil price of $79.00 per Bbl. 
Costs
Taxes, Transportation and Other
Taxes, transportation and other costs decreased 51 percent for first quarter 2024 primarily because of decreased gas production taxes and gas deductions due to lower revenues. 
Production Expense
Production expense increased 16 percent for first quarter 2024 primarily because of increased labor costs, plug and abandonment expenses, and pipeline costs, partially offset by decreased repairs and maintenance costs and field costs. 
Development Costs
Development costs decreased 69 percent for first quarter 2024 primarily due to the timing of drilling costs related to  non-operated wells in Major County, Oklahoma. Changes in oil or natural gas prices could impact future development plans on the underlying properties.
As previously disclosed, XTO Energy advised the Trustee that it elected to participate in the development of four non-operated wells in Major County, Oklahoma. XTO Energy advised the Trustee that the total development costs for the four non-operated wells was anticipated to be approximately $10 million underlying ($8 million net to the Trust). Two wells were completed in second quarter of 2023, the third was completed in fourth quarter 2023, and the fourth was completed in first quarter 2024. No assurances can be made as to the estimated costs of the non-operated wells or timing of receipt of costs for completing the wells.

Overhead
Overhead increased 9 percent for first quarter 2024. Overhead is charged by XTO Energy and other operators for administrative expenses incurred to support operations of the underlying properties. Overhead fluctuates based on changes in the active well count and drilling activity on the underlying properties, as well as an annual cost level adjustment based on an industry index.
Excess Costs
If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, these excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net profits income from another conveyance. Underlying cumulative excess costs for the Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming conveyances remaining as of March 31, 2024, totaled $4.3 million ($3.4 million net to the Trust), including accrued interest of $0.4 million ($0.3 million net to the Trust). For further information on excess costs, see Note 4 to Condensed Financial Statements.
Contingencies
For information on contingencies, see Note 3 to Condensed Financial Statements.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain information included in this Quarterly Report and other materials filed, or to be filed, by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by XTO Energy or the Trustee) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the Trust, operations of the underlying properties and the oil and gas industry. Such forward-looking statements may concern, among other things, excess costs, continuation of the Trust as a going-concern, or alternatives to a going-concern, reserve-to-production ratios, future production, development activities and associated operating expenses, future development plans by area, increased density drilling, maintenance projects, development, production, regulatory and other costs, oil and gas prices and expectations for future demand, the impact of inflation and economic downturns on economic activity, government policy and its impact on oil and gas prices and future demand, the development and competitiveness of alternative energy sources, pricing differentials, proved reserves, future net cash flows, production levels, expense reserve budgets, availability of financing, arbitration, litigation, liquidity, financing, political and regulatory matters, such as tax and environmental policy, climate policy, trade barriers, sanctions, competition, war and other political or security disturbances. Such forward-looking statements are based on XTO Energy’s and the Trustee’s current plans, expectations, assumptions, projections and estimates and are identified by words such as “may,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “should,” “could,” “would,” and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those detailed in Part I, Item 1A of the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein. Therefore, actual financial and operational results may differ materially from expectations, estimates or assumptions expressed in, implied in, or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. XTO Energy and the Trustee assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable. Upon qualifying as a smaller reporting company, this information is no longer required.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Trustee concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by XTO Energy. There has not been any change in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
Royalty Class Action and Arbitration
As previously disclosed, XTO Energy advised the Trustee that it reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the Chieftain class action royalty case. On July 27, 2018, the final plan of allocation was approved by the court. Based on the final plan of allocation, XTO Energy advised the Trustee that it believes approximately $24.3 million in additional production costs should be allocated to the Trust. On May 2, 2018, the Trustee submitted a demand for arbitration seeking a declaratory judgment that the Chieftain settlement is not a production cost and that XTO Energy is prohibited from charging the settlement as a production cost under the conveyance or otherwise reducing the Trust’s payments now or in the future as a result of the Chieftain litigation. The Trust and XTO Energy conducted the interim hearing on the claims related to the Chieftain settlement on October 12-13, 2020. In the arbitration, the Trustee contended that the approximately $24.3 million allocation related to the Chieftain settlement was not a production cost and, therefore, there should not be a related adjustment to the Trust’s share of net proceeds. However, XTO Energy contended that the approximately $24.3 million was a production cost and should reduce the Trust’s share of net proceeds. 
On January 20, 2021, the arbitration panel issued its Corrected Interim Final Award (i) “reject[ing] the Trust’s contention that XTO has no right under the Conveyance to charge the Trust with amounts XTO paid under section 1.18(a)(i) as royalty obligations to settle the Chieftain litigation” and (ii) stating “[t]he next phase will determine how much of the Chieftain settlement can be so charged, if any of it can be, in the exercise of the right found by the Panel.” Following briefing by both parties, on May 18, 2021, the Panel issued its second interim final award over the amount of XTO Energy’s settlement in the Chieftain class action lawsuit that can be charged to the Trust as a production cost. The Panel in its decision has ruled that out of the $80 million settlement, the “Trust is obligated to pay its share under the Conveyance of the $48 million that was received by the plaintiffs in the Chieftain lawsuit by virtue of the settlement of that litigation. The Trust is not obligated by the Conveyance to pay any share of the $32 million received by the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Chieftain lawsuit by virtue of the settlement.” XTO Energy and the Trustee are in the process of determining the portion of the $48 million that is allocable to Trust properties to be charged as an excess cost to the Trust but estimate it to be approximately $14.6 million net to the Trust.
The reduction in the Trust’s share of net proceeds from the portion of the settlement amount the Panel has ruled may be charged against the Oklahoma conveyance would result in excess costs under the Oklahoma conveyance that would likely result in no distributions under the Oklahoma conveyance while these excess costs are recovered. This award completes the portion of the arbitration related to the Chieftain settlement. Excess costs on any individual conveyance would not affect net proceeds to the Trust on any of the other remaining conveyances.
Other Trustee claims related to disputed amounts on the computation of the Trust’s net proceeds for 2014 through 2019 and 2021 were bifurcated from the initial arbitration. Although the arbitration is not terminated, the final hearing regarding the remaining dispute over net proceeds, previously scheduled to occur on November 8, 2023, was cancelled. XTO Energy and the Trustee will provide material updates as they become available.
Other Lawsuits and Governmental Proceedings
Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the Trustee that, based on the information available at this stage of the various proceedings, it does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Trust, but may have an effect on annual distributable income. 
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
