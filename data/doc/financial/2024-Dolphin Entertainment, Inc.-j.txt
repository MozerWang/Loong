Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dolphin, and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries, comprising Dolphin Films, Inc. (“Dolphin Films”), Dolphin SB Productions LLC, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings, LLC, Dolphin JB Believe Financing, LLC, Dolphin JOAT Productions, LLC, 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire, The Digital Dept. and Special Projects. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which it does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has the ability to exert significant influence. 

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of March 31, 2024, and its results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated from the condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements relate to the estimates in the fair value of acquisitions, estimates in assumptions used to calculate the fair value of certain liabilities and impairment assessments for investment in capitalized production costs, goodwill and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ materially from such estimates.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance on income tax disclosures (ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”). Among other requirements, this update adds specific disclosure requirements for income taxes, including: (1) disclosing specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) providing additional information for reconciling items that meet quantitative thresholds. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2023, the FASB issued new guidance on segment reporting (ASU 2023-08, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”). The amendments in the ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-08 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 

                                                                          7 



                                                         

NOTE 2 – REVENUE

 

Disaggregation of Revenue

 

The Company’s principal geographic markets are within the U.S. The following is a description of the principal activities, by reportable segment, from which we generate revenue. For more detailed information about reportable segments, see Note 12.

 

Entertainment Publicity and Marketing

 

The Entertainment Publicity and Marketing (“EPM”) segment generates revenue from diversified marketing services, including public relations, entertainment and hospitality content marketing, strategic marketing consulting and content production of marketing materials. Within the EPM segment, we typically identify one performance obligation, the delivery of professional publicity services, in which we typically act as the principal. Fees are generally recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis, as the services are consumed by our clients, which approximates the proportional performance on such contracts.

 

We also enter into management agreements with a roster of social media influencers and are paid a percentage of the revenue earned by the social media influencer. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, in which we typically act as the agent, the performance obligation is typically completed and revenue is recognized net at a point in time, typically the date of publication.

 

Content Production

 

The Content Production (“CPD”) segment generates revenue from the production of original motion pictures and other digital content production. In the CPD segment, we typically identify performance obligations depending on the type of service, for which we generally act as the principal. Revenue from motion pictures is recognized upon transfer of control of the licensing rights of the motion picture or web series to the customer. For minimum guarantee licensing arrangements, the amount related to each performance obligation is recognized when the content is delivered, and the window for exploitation right in that territory has begun, which is the point in time at which the customer is able to begin to use and benefit from the content. For sales or usage-based royalty income, revenue is recognized starting at the exhibition date and is based on the Company’s participation in the box office receipts of the theatrical exhibitor and the performance of the motion picture.

 

In June 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with IMAX Corporation (“IMAX”) to co-produce and co-finance a documentary motion picture on the flight demonstration squadron of the United States Navy called The Blue Angels. On April 25, 2023, IMAX entered into an acquisition agreement with Amazon Content Services, LLC (the “Amazon Agreement”) for the distribution rights of The Blue Angels. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded net revenues of $3,421,141 from the Amazon Agreement upon delivery of the film to Amazon Content Services LLC, our single performance obligation. Under this arrangement, we acted in the capacity of an agent. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, were no revenues recognized from the content licensing arrangement. 

 

The revenues recorded by the EPM and CPD segments is detailed below:

Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advance payments from customers for public relations projects or as deposits for promotional or brand-support video projects. Once the work is performed or the projects are delivered to the customer, the contract liabilities are deemed earned and recorded as revenue. Advance payments received are generally for short duration and are recognized once the performance obligation of the contract is met.

 

Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include the following:

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $25,220,085 of goodwill on its condensed consolidated balance sheet resulting from its acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire, The Digital Dept. and Special Projects. All of the Company’s goodwill is related to the entertainment, publicity and marketing segment.

 

The Company evaluates goodwill in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) significant decline in market capitalization or (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. There were no triggering events noted during the three months ended March 31, 2024, that would require the Company to reassess goodwill for impairment outside of its regular annual impairment test.

Special Projects is a talent booking and events agency that elevates media, fashion, and lifestyle brands. Special Projects has headquarters in New York and Los Angeles.

 

 

                                                                          9

The Company partially financed the cash portion of the consideration with the Refinancing Transaction described in Note 6.

Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations

The following presents the unaudited pro forma consolidated operations as if Special Projects had been acquired on January 1, 2023:

                                                                                                                               

                                                                                                                              Three Months Ended   

                                                                                                                                   March 31,

                                                                                                                                     2023

Revenue                                                                                                                     $          10,615,460 

Net Loss                                                                                                                    $          (2,707,940)

 

The pro forma amounts for 2023 have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of the acquisition to reflect (a) the amortization that would have been charged, assuming the intangible assets resulting from the acquisition had been recorded on January 1, 2023, (b) include interest expense on the Bank United term loan (see Note 6) in the amount of $60,967 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and (c) eliminate $111,373 of revenue and expenses related to work performed by Special Projects for Dolphin.

 

The impact of the acquisition of Special Projects on the Company’s actual results for periods following the acquisition may differ significantly from that reflected in this unaudited pro forma information for a number of reasons. As a result, this unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2023, as provided in this pro forma financial information. In addition, the pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.

NOTE 8 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

 

The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of our intangible fair values includes several assumptions and inputs (Level 3) that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Management believes it has made reasonable estimates and judgments concerning these risks and uncertainties. All other financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortized cost.

 

The Company’s cash balances are representative of their fair values, as these balances are comprised of deposits available on demand. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, notes receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable and other non-current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short turnover of these instruments.

Fair Value Option (“FVO”) Election – Convertible note payable and freestanding warrants 

 

Convertible note payable, at fair value

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had one outstanding convertible note payable with a face value of $500,000 (the “March 4th Note”), which is accounted for under the ASC 825-10-15-4 FVO election. Under the FVO election, the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item within other (expenses) income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Change in fair value of convertible note.”

 

The March 4th Note is measured at fair value and categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following is a reconciliation of the fair values from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024:

The estimated fair value of the March 4th Note as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was computed using a Black-Scholes simulation of the present value of its cash flows using a synthetic credit rating analysis and a required rate of return, using the following assumptions:

In connection with the March 4th Note, the Company issued the Series I Warrants. The Series I Warrants are measured at fair value and categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Series I Warrants were nominal as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 

NOTE 9 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

 

2022 Lincoln Park Transaction

 

On August 10, 2022, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “LP 2022 Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “LP 2022 Registration Rights Agreement”) with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which the Company could sell and issue to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park was obligated to purchase, up to $25,000,000 in value of its shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time over a 36-month period.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold 350,000 shares of its common stock, at prices ranging between $1.27 and $1.53 and received proceeds of $495,200. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company sold 300,000 shares of Common Stock at prices ranging between $1.09 and $1.27 and received proceeds of $350,150.

 

 

                                                                          14 



                                                         

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company sold 250,000 shares of its common stock, at prices ranging between $1.88 and $2.27 and received proceeds of $529,450.

 

The Company evaluated the contract that includes the right to require Lincoln Park to purchase shares of its common stock in the future (“put right”) considering the guidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASC 815-40”) and concluded that it is an equity-linked contract that does not qualify for equity classification, and therefore requires fair value accounting. The Company has analyzed the terms of the freestanding put right and has concluded that it has insignificant value as of March 31, 2024.

Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing income or loss attributable to the shareholders of common stock (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted (loss) earnings per share assume that any dilutive equity instruments, such as convertible notes payable and warrants were exercised and outstanding common stock adjusted accordingly, if their effect is dilutive. 

One of the Company’s convertible notes payable, the warrants and the Series C Preferred Stock have clauses that entitle the holder to participate if dividends are declared to the common stockholders as if the instruments had been converted into shares of common stock. As such, the Company uses the two-class method to compute earnings per share and attribute a portion of the Company’s net income to these participating securities. These securities do not contractually participate in losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss and as such the two-class method is not presented.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 potentially dilutive instruments including 3,581,213 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable and 20,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants were not included in the diluted loss per share as inclusion was considered to be antidilutive.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 potentially dilutive instruments including 2,883,114 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable and 20,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants were not included in the diluted loss per share as inclusion was considered to be antidilutive.

 

NOTE 11 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

As part of the employment agreement with its CEO, the Company provided a $1,000,000 signing bonus in 2012, which has not been paid and is recorded in accrued compensation on the consolidated balance sheets, along with unpaid base salary of $1,625,000 in aggregate attributable for the period from 2012 through 2018. Any unpaid and accrued compensation due to the CEO under his employment agreement will accrue interest on the principal amount at a rate of 10% per annum from the date of his employment agreement until it is paid. Even though the employment agreement expired and has not been renewed, the Company has an obligation under the agreement to continue to accrue interest on the unpaid balance.

 

 

                                                                          15

Amounts owed under this arrangement are payable on demand. The Company recorded interest expense related to the accrued compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations amounting to $65,445 and $64,726 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company made cash interest payments in the amount of $200,000 in connection with the accrued compensation to the CEO. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not make cash interest payments in connection with the accrued compensation to the CEO.

 

The Company entered into the DE LLC Note with an entity wholly owned by our CEO and into a nonconvertible promissory note with our CEO’s brother. See Note 7 for further discussion.

NOTE 13 — LEASES

 

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various office leases with terms expiring at different dates through November 2027. The amortizable life of the right-of-use asset is limited by the expected lease term. Although certain leases include options to extend, the Company did not include these in the right-of-use asset or lease liability calculations because it is not reasonably certain that the options will be executed.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Overview

 

We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and production company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DLPN.”

 

Through our subsidiaries 42West, Shore Fire and The Door, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West (Film and Television, Gaming), Shore Fire (Music), and The Door (Culinary, Hospitality, Lifestyle) are each recognized global PR and marketing leaders for the industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group. The Digital Dept. provides influencer marketing capabilities through divisions dedicated to influencer talent management, brand campaign strategy and execution, and influencer event ideation and production. Special Projects is the entertainment industry’s leading celebrity booking firm, specializing in uniting brands and events with celebrities and influencers across the entertainment, media, fashion, consumer product and tech industries. Dolphin’s legacy content production business, founded by our Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O’Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.

 

We have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as public relations companies in new and distinct entertainment verticals, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We completed the Special Projects acquisition during 2023 (discussed below), and intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2024, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2024 or at all.

 

We have also established an investment strategy, “Ventures” or “Dolphin 2.0,” based upon identifying opportunities to develop internally owned assets, or acquire ownership stakes in others’ assets, in the categories of entertainment content, live events and consumer products. We believe these categories represent the types of assets wherein our expertise and relationships in entertainment marketing most influences the likelihood of success. We are in various stages of internal development and outside conversations on a wide range of opportunities within these Ventures. We intend to enter into additional investments during 2024, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2024 or at all.

 

HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS

 

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenues, direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling, general and administrative expenses, legal and professional expenses, other income/expense and net income. Other income/expense consists mainly of interest expense, non-cash changes in fair value of liabilities, costs directly relating to our acquisitions, and gains or losses on extinguishment of debt and disposal of fixed assets.

 

We operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment is composed of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint, The Digital Dept. and Special Projects, and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic communications, influencer marketing, celebrity booking and live event production, creative branding, and the production of promotional video content. The content production segment is composed of Dolphin Films, Inc. (“Dolphin Films”) and Dolphin Digital Studios, which produce and distribute feature films and digital content.

 

Entertainment Publicity and Marketing

 

Our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. We believe that we have a stable client base, and we have continued to grow organically through referrals and by actively soliciting new business. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers or celebrities, (viii) curating and booking celebrities for live events; and (ix) content production of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.

 

 

                                                                          19 



                                                         

We earn entertainment publicity and marketing revenues primarily through the following:

 

        • Talent – We earn fees from creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers,

           including Oscar, Tony and Emmy winning film, theater and television stars, directors, producers, celebrity chefs and Grammy

           winning recording artists. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio and/or

           network liaison work, and event and tour support. We believe that the proliferation of content, both traditional and on

           social media, will lead to an increasing number of individuals seeking such services, which will drive growth and revenue

           in our Talent departments for several years to

           come.

 

        • Entertainment Marketing and Brand Strategy – We earn fees from providing marketing direction, public relations counsel and

           media strategy for entertainment content (including theatrical films, television programs, DVD and VOD releases, and online

           series) from virtually all the major studios and streaming services, as well as content producers ranging from individual

           filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. In

           addition, we provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, food and wine festivals, awards

           campaigns, event publicity and red-carpet management. As part of our services, we offer marketing and publicity services

           tailored to reach diverse audiences. We also provide marketing direction targeted to the ideal consumer through a creative

           public relations and creative brand strategy for hotel and restaurant groups. We expect that increased digital streaming

           marketing budgets at several large key clients will drive growth of revenue and profit in 42West’s Entertainment Marketing

           division over the next several

           years.

 

        • Strategic Communications – We earn fees by advising companies looking to create, raise or reposition their public profiles,

           primarily in the entertainment industry. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies, as well as

           high-profile individuals address sensitive situations. We believe that growth in the Strategic Communications division will

           be driven by increasing demand for these varied services by traditional and non-traditional media clients who are expanding

           their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products PR

           sectors.

 

        • Creative Branding and Production – We offer clients creative branding and production services from concept creation to final

           delivery. Our services include brand strategy, concept and creative development, design and art direction, script and

           copyrighting, live action production and photography, digital development, video editing and composite, animation, audio

           mixing and engineering, project management and technical support. We expect that our ability to offer these services to our

           existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries will be accretive to our

           revenue.

 

        • Digital Media Influencer Marketing Campaigns – We arrange strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media

           influencers, for both organic and paid campaigns. We also offer services for social media activations at events. Our

           services extend beyond our own captive influencer network, and we manage custom campaigns targeting specific demographics

           and locations, from ideation to delivery of results reports. We expect that our relationship with social media influencers

           will provide us the ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products

           industries and will be accretive to our

           revenue.

 

        • Celebrity Booking and Live Event Programming – We arrange for brands and events to book celebrity and influencer talent. Our

           services include the creation of the strategy to elevate the brand or event through celebrity and/or influencer inclusion,

           to the booking of celebrities and influencers for commercial endorsements or appearances, to the curation of event lists

           and securing attendance, to the coordination and production of live events. We believe the expansion of brands seeking

           celebrity and/or influencer endorsements, as well as celebrity and/or influencers to attend brand-sponsored live events,

           will drive growth and revenue for the next several

           years.

 

Content Production

 

Project Development and Related Services

 

We have a team that dedicates a portion of its time to identifying scripts, story treatments and novels for acquisition, development and production. The scripts can be for either digital, television or motion picture productions. We have acquired the rights to certain scripts that we intend to produce and release in the future, subject to obtaining financing. We have not yet determined if these projects would be produced for digital, television or theatrical distribution.

 

We have completed development of several feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production once financing is obtained. We are planning to fund these projects through third-party financing arrangements, domestic distribution advances, pre-sales, and location-based tax credits, and if necessary, sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to produce any of these feature films. 

 

In June 2022, we entered into an agreement with IMAX Corporation (“IMAX”) to co-produce and co-finance a documentary motion picture on the flight demonstration squadron of the United States Navy called The Blue Angels. As of March 31, 2024, we had paid $2,250,000 in connection with this agreement. On April 25, 2023, IMAX entered into an acquisition agreement with Amazon Content Services LLC, (the “Amazon Agreement”) for the distribution rights of The Blue Angels. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded revenue of $3.4 million related to the Amazon Agreement. On February 22, 2024, we received $777,905 from IMAX, as a first installment in connection with the Amazon Agreement.

 

The Blue Angels documentary will be released in theatres on May 17, 2024 and available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video on May 23, 2024.

                                                                                                        For the three months ended

                                                                                                       2024                   2023          

Revenues:                                                                                                                                   

Entertainment publicity and marketing                                                          $          11,814,751  $          9,891,421 

Content production                                                                                         3,421,141                   —

Revenues from entertainment publicity and marketing increased by approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by increases across substantially all subsidiaries, as well as the inclusion of $0.8 million of Special Projects revenues for 2024, which was not present in 2023.

 

Revenues from content production increased by approximately $3.4 million in connection with revenue generated from The Blue Angels documentary film, which will be released in theatres on May 17, 2024.

 

 

                                                                          21 



                                                         

Expenses

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our expenses were as follows: 

 

                                                                                                     For the three months ended           

                                                                                                              March 31,

                                                                                                     2024                   2023          

Expenses:                                                                                                                                 

Direct costs                                                                                 $          2,319,227  $            218,896 

Payroll and benefits                                                                                    9,574,251             9,054,730 

Selling, general and administrative                                                                     1,976,990             1,871,937 

Depreciation and amortization                                                                             553,103               533,096 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration                                                              —                  15,485 

Legal and professional                                                                                    647,781               763,277 

Total expenses                                                                               $         15,071,352  $         12,457,421 

 

Direct costs increased by approximately $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in direct costs is directly attributable to (i) $1.8 million of capitalized production costs being amortized for the production of The Blue Angels and (ii) the increase in subsidiaries’ revenues as compared with the same periods in the prior year.

 

Payroll and benefits expenses increased by approximately $0.5 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the inclusion of the Special Projects payroll expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

  

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The small increase was primarily due the inclusion of Special Projects selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Depreciation and amortization remained consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The minor increase, related primarily to the amortization of Special Projects property and equipment during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Change in fair value of the contingent consideration was a loss of $15.5 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. As all contingent consideration was settled by June 2023, there were no changes in fair value of contingent consideration for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The main components of the change in fair value of contingent consideration for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were the following:

 

        •   Be Social: losses of $15.5 thousand the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company settled this contingent

             consideration on April 25, 2023 through a combination of $500,000 in cash and 148,687 shares of the Company’s stock, with

             a value of

             $272,047.

 

Legal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to reductions of $0.8 million in audit and accounting expenses and $40.4 thousand of legal fees, offset by a small increase in other professional fees.

 

Other Income and Expenses

                                                                                                      For the three months ended           

                                                                                                               March 31,

                                                                                                     2024                   2023          

Other Income and expenses:                                                                                                              

Change in fair value of convertible note                                                     $             25,000  $            (10,444)

Change in fair value of warrants                                                                            5,000                   —   

Interest income                                                                                             5,869               102,017 

Interest expense                                                                                         (503,637)             (355,870)

Total other (expenses) income, net                                                           $           (467,768) $           (264,297)

 

Change in fair value of Convertible Notes at Fair Value – We elected the fair value option for one convertible note issued in 2020. The fair value of this convertible note is remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a $25.0 thousand gain and $10.4 thousand loss, respectively, in the fair value of the convertible notes issued in 2020. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such, all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net loss.

 

 

                                                                          22 



                                                         

Change in fair value of warrants – Warrants issued with convertible notes payable issued in 2020, were initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of the 2020 warrants that were not exercised decreased by approximately $5.0 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2024; therefore, we recorded a change in the fair value of the warrants for the three months ended March 31, 2024 for that amount on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. We did not record any change in the value of the warrants for the three months ended March 31, 2023 on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

Interest income – Interest income decreased by $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the write-off of notes receivable in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 

Interest expense – Interest expense increased by $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increases were primarily due to increased convertible and nonconvertible notes and the term loan outstanding during 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

 

Income Taxes

 

We recorded an income tax expense of approximately $24 thousand and $27 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which reflects the accrual of a valuation allowance in connection with the limitations of our indefinite lived tax assets to offset our indefinite lived tax liabilities. To the extent the tax assets are unable to offset the tax liabilities, we have recorded a deferred expense for the tax liability (a “naked credit”).

 

Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates

 

Equity in earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of income or losses from equity investments. The Company impaired its equity investment in the unconsolidated affiliates during the fourth quarter of 2023, therefore no income or loss has been recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded losses of approximately $30.0 thousand and $82.0 thousand from our equity investments in Crafthouse Cocktails and Midnight Theatre, respectively.

 

Net Loss

 

Net loss was approximately $0.3 million or $0.02 per share based on 18,477,825 weighted average shares outstanding for basic loss per share and $0.02 per share based on 18,605,702 weighted average shares outstanding for fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net loss was approximately $3.0 million or $0.23 per share based on 12,640,285 weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The change in net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, is related to the factors discussed above.

Operating Activities

 

Cash used in operating activities was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a change of $0.4 million from cash used in operating activities of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operations was primarily as a result of $2.7 million of decreased net loss for the period, offset by a $1.7 million increase in non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, share-based compensation, impairment of capitalized production costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible asset and other non-cash losses and a $4.0 million net change in working capital.

 

Investing Activities

 

There were no cash flows used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.

 

 

                                                                          23 



                                                         

Financing Activities

 

Cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $0.9 million, which mainly related to:

 

Inflows:

 

        •   $0.9 million of proceeds from notes payable;

        •   $0.5 million of proceeds from the LP 2022 Purchase Agreement (described below); and

 

Outflows:

 

        •   $0.2 million of repayment of existing term loan;

        •   $0.2 million of payment of interest to related party; and

        •   $17.9 thousand on principal payments on finance leases.

 

Cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $3.2 million, which mainly related to:

 

Inflows:

 

        •   $2.2 million of proceeds from notes payable;

        •   $0.8 million of proceeds from convertible notes payable; and

        •   $0.5 million of proceeds from the LP 2022 Purchase Agreement.

 

Outflows:

 

        •   $0.3 million of repayment of notes payable, term loan, and interest to related party.

 

Debt and Financing Arrangements 

 

Total debt amounted to $20.0 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $19.3 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.7 million, primarily related to an increase in related party nonconvertible promissory notes.

 

Our debt obligations in the next twelve months from March 31, 2024 of $4.9 million remained consistent with those of December 31, 2023. We expect our current cash position, cash expected to be generated from our operations and other availability of funds, as detailed below, to be sufficient to meet our debt requirements.

 

2022 Lincoln Park Transaction

 

On August 10, 2022, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement (the “LP 2022 Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “LP 2022 Registration Rights Agreement”) with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which the Company could sell and issue to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park was obligated to purchase, up to $25,000,000 in value of its shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time over a 36-month period.

 

The Company may direct Lincoln Park, at its sole discretion, and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 50,000 shares of its common stock on any business day (a “Regular Purchase”). The amount of a Regular Purchase may be increased under certain circumstances up to 75,000 shares if the closing price is not below $7.50 and up to 100,000 shares if the closing price is not below $10.00, provided that Lincoln Park’s committed obligation for Regular Purchases on any business day shall not exceed $2,000,000. In the event we purchase the full amount allowed for a Regular Purchase on any given business day, we may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated and additional accelerated purchases. The purchase price of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the future funding will be based on the then prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales as described in the LP 2022 Purchase Agreement.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold 350,000 shares of its common stock, at prices ranging between $1.27 and $1.53 and received proceeds of $495,200. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company sold 300,000 shares of Common Stock at prices ranging between $1.09 and $1.27 and received proceeds of $350,150.

 

The Company evaluated the contract that includes the right to require Lincoln Park to purchase shares of its common stock in the future (“put right”) considering the guidance in ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts on an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASC 815-40”) and concluded that it is an equity-linked contract that does not qualify for equity classification, and therefore requires fair value accounting. The Company has analyzed the terms of the freestanding put right and has concluded that it has insignificant value as of March 31, 2024.

 

Convertible Notes Payable

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has ten convertible notes payable outstanding.

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.

 

We consider the fair value estimates, including those related to acquisitions, valuations of goodwill, intangible assets, acquisition-related contingent consideration and convertible debt to be the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require significant or complex judgment and estimates on the part of management.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans and strategies, as well as statements, other than historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” ”intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “goal” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.

 

Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected and future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our views only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by applicable law.

 

Risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements include those described as “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Management’s Report on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, which have not been remediated as of the date of the filing of this report.

 

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

We have begun the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following:

 

        •  Developing formal policies and procedures over the Company’s fraud risk assessment and risk management function;

 

        •  Developing policies and procedures to enhance the precision of management review of financial statement information and

            control impact of changes in the external

            environment;

 

        •  We have entered into an agreement with a third-party consultant that assists us in analyzing complex transactions and the

            appropriate accounting

            treatment;

 

        •  We are enhancing our policies, procedures and documentation of period end closing procedures;

 

        •  Implementing policies and procedures to enhance independent review and documentation of journal entries, including

            segregation of duties;

            and

 

        •  Reevaluating our monitoring activities for relevant controls.

 

Management is beginning the process of implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and will make any further changes deemed appropriate. Management believes our planned remedial efforts will effectively remediate the identified material weaknesses. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine it is necessary to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine it necessary to modify the remediation plan described above.
