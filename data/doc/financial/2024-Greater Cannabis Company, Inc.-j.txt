Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements

 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “plan,” “future,” “continue, “and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to historical matters identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations or forecasts of future events, can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, and are subject to various business risks and known and unknown uncertainties, a number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this document, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A wide variety of factors could cause or contribute to such differences and could adversely impact revenues, profitability, cash flows and capital needs. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this document will, in fact, transpire or prove to be accurate. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.

 

Important factors that may cause the actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements, projections or other expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

     ●    risk that we will not be able to remediate identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting

           and disclosure controls and

           procedures;

           

     ●    risk that we fail to meet the requirements of the agreements under which we acquired our business interests, including any

           cash payments to the business operations, which could result in the loss of our right to continue to operate or develop the

           specific businesses described in the

           agreements;

           

     ●    risk that we will be unable to secure additional financing in the near future in order to commence and sustain our planned

           development and growth

           plans;

           

     ●    risk that we cannot attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly employees, consultants and contractors

           for our

           operations;

           

     ●    risks and uncertainties relating to the various industries and operations we are currently engaged in;

           

     ●    results of initial feasibility, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, and the possibility that future growth, development

           or expansion will not be consistent with our

           expectations;

           

     ●    risks related to the inherent uncertainty of business operations including profit, cost of goods, production costs and cost

           estimates and the potential for unexpected costs and

           expenses;

           

     ●    risks related to commodity price fluctuations;

           

     ●    the uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses;

           

     ●    risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms for our planned development

           projects;

           

     ●    risks related to environmental regulation and liability;

           

     ●    risks related to tax assessments;

           

     ●    other risks and uncertainties related to our prospects, properties and business strategy.

 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

NOTE A – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Nature of Operations

 

The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp (“Sylios”) until March 10, 2017.

 

On July 31, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock of Green C Corporation (“Green C”) in exchange for 9,411,998 newly issued shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Exchange”). Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 50 shares of common stock and is entitled to vote 50 votes per share on all matters as a class with holders of common stock. Since after the Exchange was consummated, the former shareholders of Green C and their designees owned approximately 94% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the Company, Green C is the acquirer for accounting purposes. Prior to the Exchange, the Company had no assets and nominal business operations. Accordingly, the Exchange has been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer, Green C, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of Green C from its inception on December 21, 2017 to July 31, 2018 and combined with the Company thereafter.

 

Green C was incorporated on December 21, 2017 under the laws of the Province of Ontario Canada with its principal place of business in North York, Ontario.

 

Green C was the owner of an exclusive, worldwide license for an eluting transmucosal patch platform (“ETP”) for non-invasive drug delivery in the cannabis field as further described in the exclusive license agreement dated June 21, 2018 with Pharmedica Ltd. (see Note J).

 

After the consummation of the above-described transactions, the Company switched its business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer intended to pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. Instead, the Company is now engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative cannabinoid therapeutics.

 

From July 2018 through mid-2021, the Company focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal and transdermal delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids. The Company’s initial product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which for provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body. Although the Company was able to launch the product and received some limited initial orders, the Company’s management ultimately elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability.

 

Accordingly, on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. (“SZS”), the technology transfer arm of Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS’s novel cannabinoid therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

 

Accompanying the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor of the novel cannabinoid therapy.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary Biocanrx, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

                                                                  F-6

 

 

THE GREATER CANNABIS COMPANY, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE A – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 

Interim Financial Statements

 

The interim financial statements as of March 31, 2024 are unaudited and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained herein. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Certain information and finance disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 as included in our report on Form 10-K.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash are considered to be cash equivalents. For the periods presented, the Company had no in cash equivalents.

 

Notes and Accounts Receivable

 

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products and other consideration delivered. The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information. If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required. Historically, the Company’s reserves have approximated actual experience.

 

Income Taxes

 

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

 

We expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of March 31, 2024, we had no uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. We currently have no foreign federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any foreign federal or state examinations since our inception. To date, we have not incurred any interest or tax penalties.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

We follow ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that requires the use of fair value measurements that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.

 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:

 

                                                                  F-7

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE A – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 

Level 1:            Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:            Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data

Level 3:            Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s

                     own

                     assumptions.

 

The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. Except for derivative liabilities, we had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.

 

Derivative Liabilities

 

We evaluate convertible notes payable, stock options, stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40, Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.

 

The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

 

Long-lived Assets

 

Long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. We test for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve management’s estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting results and financial positions. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

 

                                                                  F-8

Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services

 

Issuances of our common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.

 

Although situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time, the equity award granted to the party performing the service may be fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a result, in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist if the instruments are fully vested on the date of agreement, we determine such date to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to expense over the contract period. When it is appropriate for us to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current fair values.

 

Related Parties

 

A party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. Related parties also include our principal owners, our management, members of the immediate families of our principal owners and our management and other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties, or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, is also a related party.

 

                                                                  F-9

Revenue Recognition

 

Revenue recognition:

 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, in accordance with the following five-step process:

 

     ●    Identify the contract(s) with a customer

     ●    Identify the performance obligations

     ●    Determine the transaction price

     ●    Allocate the transaction price

     ●    Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met

 

During the periods presented, all revenue was from sales of cannabis products. The Company has determined the sole performance obligation to be the delivery of the purchased goods to the customers, and as such, recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession.

 

Advertising Costs

 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the periods presented, we had no advertising costs.

 

Loss per Share

 

We compute net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.

 

Basic loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock options, warrants and convertible securities) outstanding. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per share are excluded from the calculation. For the periods presented, the Company excluded 470,599,900 shares relating to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note H), shares relating to convertible notes payable to third parties (Please see NOTE E - NOTES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES for further information) and shares relating to outstanding warrants (Please see NOTE G - CAPITAL STOCK AND WARRANTS for further information) from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

 

                                                                  F-10

Recently Enacted Accounting Standards

 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)”. This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on July 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements.

 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) amends guideline on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The amendments in this ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements.

 

Other standards not presented are not deemed to be material.

 

                                                                  F-11

NOTE B - GOING CONCERN

 

Under ASC 205-40, we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our future obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. As required by this standard, our evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.

 

In performing the first step of this assessment, we concluded that the following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations as they become due. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $129,323, total current liabilities of $839,333, and negative working capital of $710,010. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $44,611 and used $37,536 cash from operating activities. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until such time as our business generates sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements.

 

In performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources.

 

There is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing shareholders. We have therefore concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through March 2025.

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.

 

                                                                  F-12

NOTE C – RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AGREEMENT

 

On January 30, 2020, the Company executed a Right of First Refusal Agreement with an entity engaged in the business of cosmetics, health, and well-being. The Agreement provided for the Company to pay Kol Tuv Ventures, LLC (“KTV”), $25,000 on January 30, 2020 (which was paid January 30,2020) and to make other investments in opportunities to be pursued by KTV and/or payments to KTV to enable KTV to pursue and secure Cannabidiol (“CBD”) opportunities. The Agreement provides the Company an exclusive right of first refusal to participate in all CBD opportunities to be pursued by KTV for a term of five years. The $25,000 cost for this Agreement is being amortized over the five year term of the Agreement.

Any amount of principal or interest on the FF Note, which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-four (24%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid (“Default Interest”). FF has the right beginning on the date which is the earlier of (i) the date the Registration Statement (as defined below) covering the shares issuable upon conversion of the FFG Notes is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or (ii) one hundred eighty (180) days following the Issue Date to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of the FF Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of our common stock at the conversion price (the “Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price shall be, equal to 70% of the average closing price of our common stock for the five prior trading days prior to the date that a registration statement in respect of the shares into which is the FF Note is convertible is declared effective. The FF Note contains other customary terms found in like instruments for conversion price adjustments. In the case of an Event of Default (as defined in the Note), the FF Note shall become immediately due and payable in an amount (the “Default Amount”) equal to the principal amount then outstanding plus accrued interest (including any Default Interest) through the date of full repayment multiplied by one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) and interest shall accrue at the rate of Default Interest.

The Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) contain a variable conversion feature based on the future trading price of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes is indeterminate.

 

The fair value of the derivative liability is measured at the respective issuance dates and quarterly thereafter using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at December 31, 2020 were (1) stock price of $.003 per share, (2) conversion price of $.00169 per share, (3) term of 0 days, (4) expected volatility of 142.94%, and (5) risk free interest rate of 0%. Assumptions used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at March 31, 2021 were (1) stock price of $.0011 per share, (2) conversion price of $.0071 per share, (3) term of 345 days, (4) expected volatility of 142.94%, and (5) risk free interest rate of .07%. As of June 30, 2021, the note no longer carries variable conversion features and as such, the derivative was reduced to zero.

 

(i)As discussed in Note A above, warrants with “down round” features (and do not contain variable conversion features) are not subject to derivative liability treatment effective January 1, 2019.

 

                                                                  F-15

NOTE G - CAPITAL STOCK AND WARRANTS

 

Preferred Stock

 

On July 31, 2018, The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (the “Company”) acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock of Green C Corporation (“Green C”) in exchange for 9,411,998 newly issued shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Exchange”). Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 50 shares of common stock and is entitled to 50 votes on all matters as a class with the holders of common stock.

 

On February 14, 2019, the Company issued 9,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Emet Capital Partners, LLC (“Emet”) in exchange for the surrender of all outstanding warrants held by Emet. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into one share of Company common stock subject to adjustment in case, at the time of conversion, the market price per share of the Company common stock was less than $0.075 per share. On October 18, 2019, this exchange agreement was reversed. (See Note E)

 

On September 21, 2021, 300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Shares were converted into 15,000,000 shares of common stock.

Emet asserted that the Company had committed a dilutive issuance, which triggered the “ratchet-down” provision of the related note which provides for a reduction of the conversion price.

On May 29, 2019, the Company issued a total of 542,000 shares of its common stock to two consulting firm entities for certain specified investor relations and advisory services.

The Company and its United States subsidiaries file consolidated Federal income tax returns. Green C Corporation, its Ontario Canada subsidiary, files Canada and Ontario income tax returns.

 

At March 31, 2024 the Company has available for federal income tax purposes a net operating loss carry forward that may be used to offset future taxable income. The Company has provided a valuation reserve against the full amount of the net operating loss benefit, since in the opinion of management based upon the earnings history of the Company, it is not more likely than not that the benefits will be realized. If there are significant changes in the Company’s ownership, the future use of its existing net operating losses will be limited.

 

All tax years of the Company and its United States subsidiaries remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

NOTE I - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Pharmedica Exclusive License Agreement

 

On June 21, 2018, Green C executed an Exclusive License Agreement with Pharmedica, Ltd. (“Pharmedica”), an Israeli company, to exploit certain Pharmedica intellectual property for the development and distribution of a certain Licensed Product involved in the transmucosal delivery of medicinal or recreational cannabis. The agreement provides for Green C payments to Pharmedica of a $100,000 license fee (which was paid by 2591028 Ontario Limited, an entity affiliated with Green C’s Chief Executive Officer, on June 26, 2018) and annual royalties at a rate of 5% of the Net Sales of the Licensed Product subject to a Minimum Annual Royalty of $50,000. The agreement also provides for certain milestones to be accomplished by Green C in order for Green C to retain the license. Green C and Pharmedica each may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party of its obligations under the agreement and such other party’s failure to remedy such breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the other party within thirty (30) days after being requested in writing to do so.

 

The Company generated only minimal revenues from this asset through December 31, 2019 and did not pay the Year 1 Minimum Annual Royalty of $50,000 due Pharmedica. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $69,749 at December 31, 2019 and reduced the $69,749 remaining carrying value of this intangible asset to $0.

 

On September 2, 2020, Green C notified Pharmedica of Green C’s termination of the Exclusive License Agreement and Green C’s intention to wind up Green C.

 

On September 17, 2020, Pharmedica notified Green C of Pharmedica’s acceptance of Green C’s proposal to terminate the license agreement and Pharmedica’s intention not to burden Green C further. Accordingly, we recorded “Forgiveness of Royalty Payable” other income of $50,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020 and reduced the $50,000 “Accrued Royalties” liability balance to $0.

 

Sub-License Agreement with Symtomax Unipessoal Lda

 

On July 15, 2019, the Company executed a Sub-License Agreement with Symtomax Unipessoal Lda (“Symtomax”).

 

The agreement provides for the Company’s grant to Symtomax of a non-exclusive right and sub-license to use certain Company technology and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products for sale in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The agreement provides for Symtomax payments of royalties to the Company (payable monthly) ranging from 10% to 17% of Symtomax sales of eluting patches developed from Company technology.

 

On May 27, 2020, the Company executed an amended and restated sub-license agreement with Symtomax (the “Amended License Agreement”). The term of the Amended License Agreement ends the earlier of (i) August 31, 2021 and (ii) the date that Symtomax is no longer commercializing any of the products. The term is extended for an additional year on each anniversary of the agreement for any country where the royalty payment in respect of such country was equal to or greater than $1,000,000 for the previous year.

 

To date, Symtomax has not made any sales requiring the payment of royalties to the Company.

While part of the cannabis family, CBD, which contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” in marijuana, is distinguished from cannabis by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration (cannabis generally has a THC level of 10% or more). The Company’s initial product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which for provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body. Although the Company was able to launch the product and received some limited initial orders, Greater Cannabis management ultimately elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability.

 

Accordingly, on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. (“SZS”), the technology transfer arm of Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS’s novel cannabinoid therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Shaare Zedek Medical Center, founded in 1901, is one of the largest multidisciplinary research hospitals in Israel with 1,000 beds and over 850,000 patient visits a year. The SZMC Center for Research and Development has over 300 annual publications of investigator initiated studies in medical journals in addition to almost 160 clinical trials.

 

Accompanying the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor of the novel cannabinoid therapy. Dr. Aran is a world renowned expert in cannabis research and pediatric neurology and was the principal investigator of the first ever cannabis research study conducted on autistic children.

 

Dr. Aran’s pioneering study assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of CBD based medical cannabis as an adjuvant therapy for refractory behavioral problems in children with ASD. The results provided very compelling evidence that medical cannabis is an effective therapy for children on the autism spectrum. Conditions in 80% of the children improved, with 62% of parents reporting substantial improvements. Half of the children had improved communication and 40% reported a decrease in anxiety. The same children had not shown improvement with conventional drug therapies. Dr. Aran and his team have now developed a novel combination therapy that is believed to be significantly more effective than the cannabis-only formulation that had been used in the aforementioned study. The Company plans to further develop this therapeutic and conduct clinical studies to further substantiate its safety and efficacy beginning in neuropsychiatric disorders.

 

The clinical studies of the therapeutic are expected to require an investment of up to $1,000,000 and up to two years to finalize.

 

The Company’s current business plan is to (i) conduct clinical studies on and commercialize the cannabinoid-based therapeutic and (ii) concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

The SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies” suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and (ii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management expects to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results.

 

                                                                   5

 

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Aitan Zacharin, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal executive, financial and accounting officer), and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

Our chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer (principal executive, financial and accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at March 21, 2022, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment under those criteria, management has determined that, as of March 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting was not effective for the reasons set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 

As set forth in that Report the Company intends to take various remedial measures described therein as its capital resources permit.

 

                                                                   6

 

 

Changes in Internal Controls

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
