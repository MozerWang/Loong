INTRODUCTORY COMMENT

 

Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Blackboxstocks,” or the “Company” refers to Blackboxstocks Inc., a Nevada corporation.

 

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

Our prospects are subject to uncertainties and risks. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Report”), we make forward-looking statements that involve substantial uncertainties and risks. When used in this Report, the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “continue,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) regarding events, conditions and financial trends which may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties described herein and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements. Additional factors are described in our other public reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revision of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

 

This Report contains certain estimates and plans related to us and the industry in which we operate, which assume certain events, trends and activities will occur and the projected information based on those assumptions. We do not know that all of our assumptions are accurate. If our assumptions are wrong about any events, trends and activities, then our estimates for future growth for our business may also be wrong. There can be no assurance that any of our estimates as to our business growth will be achieved.

 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes associated with them contained elsewhere in this Report. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed in this Report will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached in this Report will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. The discussion represents only the best assessment of management.

The Company changed its name to Blackboxstocks, Inc. and began operating as a financial technology and social media platform in March 2016.

The software continuously scans the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange, CBOE, and other options markets, analyzing over 10,000 stocks and up to 1,500,000 options contracts multiple times per second. The Company also provides users with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. Recently, the Company also introduced a live audio/video feature that allows members to broadcast on their own channels to share trade strategies and market insight within the community. The platform was initially made available to subscribers in September 2016. Subscriptions for the use of the platform are sold on a monthly and/or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through the Company website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation The accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements and footnotes of Blackboxstocks Inc. have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the full year ending December 31, 2024. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in assumption of the continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain sufficient financing or establish itself as a profitable business. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred an operating loss of $5,297,671 and a net loss of $4,664,455. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred an operating loss of $863,966 and a net loss of $863,711. Cash flows used in operations totaled $3,166,067 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $353,803 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $114,968 as of March 31, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has executed a share exchange agreement with Evtec Aluminium Limited (“Evtec Aluminium”), whereby the Company expects to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Evtec Aluminium with the result of Evtec Aluminium becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Exchange”).  The Exchange will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Evtec Aluminium being the accounting acquiror. The Company believes that the Exchange with Evtec Aluminium will attract additional capital investment as Evtec Aluminium is substantially larger than Blackbox and has a strong acquisition pipeline. Management has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving operating cash flow including, new product development, revised marketing strategies and expense reductions. In addition, the Company has historically been able to raise debt or equity financing to meet its capital needs and is also evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to possible mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operational changes will impact its cash flow or if it will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms or if it will be able to execute the planned Exchange with Evtec Aluminium.

 

The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.

Use of Estimates. The Company’s financial statement preparation requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in order to report these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Segments. The Company operates as a single segment.

 

Cash. Cash includes all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less.

 

Investments in Marketable Securities. The Company has invested in marketable securities which primarily consist of investments in mutual funds that hold commercial and government debt securities. These investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices at the end of the Company’s reporting period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses are recognized in the accompanying statements of operations.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no new accounting pronouncements issued that management believes the adoption of which will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

 

Earnings or (Loss) Per Share. Basic earnings per share (or loss per share), is computed by dividing the earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by including other potentially issuable shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Therefore, because including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities and/or exercise of outstanding options and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share, only the basic earnings (loss) per share is reported in the accompanying financial statements for periods of loss.

 

The Company had total potential additional dilutive securities outstanding at March 31, 2024, as follows.

 

  Series A Convertible Preferred Shares                                                                  3,269,998 

  Conversion rate                                                                                              0.2 

  Common shares after conversion                                                                           654,000 

  Option shares                                                                                            200,875 

  Warrant shares                                                                                           109,584 

 

Revenue Recognition. The Company operates under a software as a service (SaaS) model whereby we sell monthly and annual subscriptions allowing subscribers access to our platform. We recognize revenue over the subscription period (either monthly or annual) and record cash received but not yet earned as deferred revenue on our balance sheet.

 

Additionally, the Company receives revenues from commissions and the sale of promotional products which are presented as other revenues on the accompanying statements of operations. Commission revenues are recognized as they are earned and revenues from the sale of promotional products are recognized upon shipment.

Evtec Group Limited (“Evtec”) operates through a single subsidiary, Evtec Automotive Limited, as a supplier of critical automotive parts to the automobile manufacturing industry.

On June 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the Securities Exchange Agreement”) with Evtec Group whereby the Company issued 2,400,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Stock”) (Note 4) in exchange for 4,086 preferred shares of Evtec Group. Upon conversion of the Series B Stock, the 2,400,000 shares would represent approximately 43% of the total common shares outstanding. The Evtec Group preferred shares are convertible into common shares of Evtec Group on a one-for-one basis upon a change in control or the listing of Evtec Group on Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange. The preferred shares of Evtec Group were converted into common shares representing approximately 13% of Evtec Group.

 

The Company’s initial investment in Evtec was measured at $8,424,000 in accordance with ASC 820-10-30. The value of the Series B Stock issued by the Company was set by the closing price of its common stock on the day prior to closing of $3.51 as reported by Nasdaq. As a result, the 2,400,000 Series B Stock shares were valued at $8,424,000. The investment was reviewed for impairment as of March 31, 2024.

 

On November 24, 2023, the Company entered into a Binding Amendment to Amended Letter of Intent (the “LOI Amendment”) with Evtec Group, Evtec Automotive Limited, and Evtec Aluminium (the “Evtec Companies), which amended a non-binding Amended Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) dated April 14, 2023. Pursuant to the LOI Amendment, the Company has agreed to continue to negotiate in good faith to consummate a proposed acquisition of the Evtec Companies contemplated by the LOI (the “Proposed Transaction”), subject to the terms of the LOI Amendment.

 

As a condition to the Company’s continued good faith negotiations regarding the Proposed Transaction, the Evtec Companies agreed to (i) pay the Company aggregate extension fees totaling $400,000 which were guaranteed by a credit worthy affiliate of the Evtec Companies, (ii) provide extension loans of up to $400,000 to the Company if the Proposed Transaction has not closed on or before April 1, 2024, (iii) pay the Company amounts in cash equal to any documented legal fees and third-party expenses incurred or payable by the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction up to $175,000, including any such expenses incurred prior to the date of the LOI Amendment, (iv) forfeit and return 2,400,000 shares of the Series B Stock acquired by Evtec Group under the terms of that certain Securities Exchange Agreement, and (v) permit the Company to convert each of the 4,086 preferred shares of Evtec Group issued to the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement into one ordinary share of Evtec Group. $475,000 and $0 was outstanding and classified as other receivables on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

 

As provided for in the LOI Amendment, Evtec Group entered into a Forfeiture Agreement with the Company dated November 28, 2023 in which Evtec Group agreed to forfeit all of its right, title and interest in and to the 2,400,000 shares of Series B Stock acquired by Evtec Group pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement in order to further induce the Company to continue to negotiate in good faith to consummate the Proposed Transaction. Pursuant to the Forfeiture Agreement, the Company has no obligation to make any payment to Evtec Group, in cash or otherwise, for any such Series B Stock that are so forfeited. The Series B Stock forfeited by Evtec Group were cancelled as of the date as of the date of the Forfeiture Agreement. In addition, Evtec Group agreed to convert the preferred shares into 4,086 common shares.

 

On December 12, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement") with Evtec Aluminium, and the shareholders of Evtec Aluminium (“Sellers”). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company is expected to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Evtec Aluminium Ordinary Shares, with the result of Evtec Aluminium becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Exchange”). At the closing of the Exchange (the “Closing”), the Sellers will receive shares of common stock of the Company, $0.001 par value, in exchange for capital shares of Evtec Aluminium based on the exchange ratio formula in the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”), which is subject to adjustment in the event Evtec Aluminium raises capital before Closing in excess of $5,000,000. Immediately following Closing, based upon the Exchange Ratio, the Sellers are expected to collectively own 73.2% of the aggregate common stock of the Company. Discussions for the Company to acquire Evtec Group are ongoing.

The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock at $0.001 par value, 5,000,000 of which are designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” at $0.001 par value, 2,400,000 of which are designated as “Series B Convertible Preferred Stock” at $0.001 par value, and 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock at $0.001 par value (“Common Stock”).

 

Shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Stock”) rank pari passu with the Company’s Common Stock with respect to dividend and liquidation rights. Additionally, each share entitles the holder to 100 votes on matters submitted to Company stockholders. There are 3,269,998 shares of Series A Stock outstanding which are all held by Gust Kepler, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Mr. Kepler”). The Company and Mr. Kepler entered into Conversion Rights Agreement dated effective as of October 14, 2021, limiting the rights of the holder(s) of our outstanding shares of Series A Stock to convert such shares into Common Stock on a one-for-one basis as provided in the certificate of designation (the "Designation Conversion Rights"). Pursuant to the terms of the Conversion Rights Agreement, the Designation Conversion Rights are limited and exercisable based upon the Company reaching the following market capitalization ("Market Capitalization") thresholds, measured on the last day of each calendar quarter:

 

       ●    If the Company’s Market Capitalization is less than $150,000,000, the outstanding Series A Stock will be convertible into

             Common Stock on a 5-for-1 share

             basis;

       ●    If the Company’s Market Capitalization is equal to or greater than $150,000,000 but less than $200,000,000, the

             outstanding Series A Stock will be convertible into Common Stock on a 3.3-for-1 share

             basis;

       ●    If the Company’s Market Capitalization is equal to or greater than $200,000,000 but less than $250,000,000, the

             outstanding Series A Stock will be convertible into Common Stock on a 2.5-for-1 share

             basis;

       ●    If the Company’s Market Capitalization is equal to or greater than $250,000,000 but less than $350,000,000 the outstanding

             Series A Stock will be convertible into Common Stock on a 1.75-for-1 share

             basis;

       ●    If the Company’s Market Capitalization is equal to or greater than $350,000,000 the outstanding Series A Stock will

             thereafter convertible into Common Stock pursuant to the Designation Conversion Rights (on a 1-for-1 share

             basis).

 

The Conversion Rights Agreement terminates when the last share of Series A Stock is either converted or the largest Market Capitalization Threshold is met.

 

The Series B Stock has no dividend rights and no voting rights except as required by law or the Company’s bylaws. The Series B Stock is convertible into common shares on a one-for-one basis. Prior to the stockholder approval, the Series B Stock is not convertible into more than 19.9% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Series B Stock was forfeited in December 2023.

The Company is defendant to a lawsuit filed by Feenix Payment Systems, LLC before the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York on June 20, 2023. The plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $500,000 from an alleged breach of an exclusivity agreement between the plaintiff and the Company. The Company denies any liability for the alleged breach and intends to defend the matter vigorously. The Company has asserted a counterclaim alleging the plaintiff failed to pay the Company a finder’s fee. In addition, the Company is party to threatened or actual litigation occurring in the normal course of business but does not believe that the outcome of these matters could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

 

 

 

10. Subsequent Events

As required by the Share Exchange Agreement, on April 1, 2024, the Company formed Blackbox.io Inc., a Delaware Corporation, and on April 18, 2024, the Company and Blackbox.io Inc entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company transferred certain specified business assets (the “Contributed Assets”) to Blackbox.io Inc. In consideration for the Contributed Assets, Blackbox.io Inc issued to the Company 3,226,145 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Blackbox .io Inc. and 3,369,998 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Blackbox.io Inc, free and clear of all liens (the “Blackbox.io Operating Equity”), and assumed certain specified liabilities of the business of the Company (the “Assumed Liabilities”).

 

Simultaneously with the execution of the Contribution Agreement, the Company delivered fully executed documents of conveyance to effect the contribution of the Contributed Assets and the assignment of the Assumed Liabilities to Blackbox.io Inc, including (i) a bill of sale, (ii) an assignment and assumption agreement and (iii) an intellectual property assignment and Blackbox.io Inc delivered certificates and notices of issuance of stock transferable on the books of Blackbox.io Inc evidencing the issuance of the Blackbox.io Operating Equity.

 

The Contribution Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. As a result of the Contribution Agreement, Blackbox.io Inc. is a wholly-owned corporate subsidiary of the Company that now holds the Company’s legacy assets and continues its legacy business operations.

 

On May 13, 2024 the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form 4 including an information statement/prospectus and a notice of action taken by written consent pursuant to section 14(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as required under the terms of the Securities Exchange Agreement with Evtec Aluminium. The registration statement is subject to review and approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission and has not yet been declared effective.

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in assumption of the continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain sufficient financing or establish itself as a profitable business. For the Three Months ended March 31, 2024 the Company incurred an operating loss of $863,969 and a net loss of $863,711. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred an operating loss of $5,297,671 and a net loss of $4,664,455. Cash flows used in operations were $353,803 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $(3,166,067) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has cash and cash equivalents of $114,968 as of March 31, 2024.These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has executed a share exchange agreement with Evtec Aluminium Ltd (“Evtec”), whereby the Company expects to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Evtec with the result of Evtec becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Exchange”).  in the Exchange will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Evtec being the accounting acquiror. The Company believes that the merger with Evtec will attract additional capital investment as Evtec is substantially larger than Blackbox and has a strong acquisition pipeline. Management has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving operating cash flow including, new product development, revised marketing strategies and expense reductions. In addition, the Company has historically been able to raise debt or equity financing to meet its capital needs and is also evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to possible mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s operational changes will impact its cash flow or if it will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms or if it will be able to execute the planned merger with Evtec.

 

The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.

 

Significant Accounting Policies

 

There have been no changes from the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1. 2024.

 

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities totaling $114,968 as compared to cash and marketable securities totaling $475,652 at December 31, 2023. Our cash flows used in operations were $353,803 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $1,250,895 for the same period in the prior year.

 

Net cash from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $3,303 as compared to $1,082,291 for the prior year period. The decrease in the cash flow from investing activities was due to the liquidation of marketable securities in order to fund the Company’s operations during the prior year. The volume of marketable securities includes trading activity in a Company account that was used to research and test specific trading techniques although the account held less than $100,000. We do not expect capital expenditures to be significant for the remainder of 2024.

 

Net cash used in financing activities was $7,229 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $7,186 for the prior year period.

As noted above, the Company intends to pursue the planned acquisition transaction with Evtec however there can be no assurance that it will be able to complete the transaction or that such a transaction will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. In addition, the Company may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in order to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or on acceptable terms.

 

Results of Operations 

 

Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue was $649,420, as compared to $859,004, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decline in revenue of 24.4% was due to a combination of fewer subscribers and lower average revenue per subscriber. Average users for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 2,944 as compared to 3,555 for the prior year period. Average monthly revenue per user was $71,99 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $80,17 in the prior year period. The decline in average revenue per subscriber was due to the sale of a large number of two year subscriptions for $1,198 during the Black Friday Cyber Monday holiday promotions in 2023.

 

Cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $357,958 and $447,641, resulting in gross margins of 45% and 48%, respectively. The primary components of cost of revenues include costs related to data and news feed expenses for exchange information which comprise the majority of the costs, as well as the costs for program moderators. The gross margin percentage declined due to lower revenues and a higher percentage of fixed versus variable costs.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, operating expenses were $1,155,428 as compared to $2,358,177 for the same period in 2022, a decrease of $1,202,749 or 51%. We significantly reduced expenditures in software development costs, advertising and marketing and selling general and administrative expenses for the 2024 period. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from $1,777,634 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $905,929 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $871,705 or 49%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower stock-based compensation expense which was partially offset by higher professional fees associated with the pending Exchange with Evtec Aluminum. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $82,258 or 38% from $214,981 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $132,723 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as the Company continues to reposition its marketing strategy. Software development costs decreased by $246,641 or 70% from $355,044 in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $108,403 for the three months ended March 31, 20243. The decreased software development costs reflected lower development costs for our new product Stock Nanny as it nears release.

 

Our loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $863,966 as compared to a loss from operations of $1,946,804 for the prior year period. The improvement in the loss from operations was driven by lower operating expenses and was partially offset by the lower sales and gross profits.

EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)

 

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and that when GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses (i) to compare operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) for planning purposes including the preparation of its internal annual operating budget and (iii) as a basis for evaluating performance. For all non-GAAP financial measures in this release, we have provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes in the report.

 

EBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization expense and certain non-cash. EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of liquidity. Moreover, since EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA:

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

As of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and as such, we are not required to provide the information required under this Item.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 

Gust Kepler, our principal executive officer and Robert Winspear, our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

 

Our disclosure controls and procedures provide our principal executive officer and principal financial officer with reasonable assurances that our disclosure controls and procedures will achieve their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting can or will prevent all human error. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are internal resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be weighed relative to their corresponding costs. Because of the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide complete assurance that all control issues and instances of error, if any, within our company are detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur due to human error or mistake. Additionally, controls, no matter how well designed, could be circumvented by the individual acts of specific persons within the organization. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all potential future conditions.
