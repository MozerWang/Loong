General Enterprise Ventures, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

March 31, 2024

 

Note 1 – Organization, Business and Going Concern

 

General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., (the “Company” “GEVI”), was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 1990. On June 3, 2021, after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was redomiciled to the State of Wyoming.

 

Business

 

The Company’s U.S. subsidiary, Mighty Fire Breaker LLC (“MFB”) is engaged in developing solutions to support the resolution of the insurance crisis in the western United States by use of its EPA approved CitroTech products. MFB has developed and patented additional intellectual property in this regard, such as a system for commercial properties and homes that puts a fire inhibiting buffer zone around a property, blocking blown-in embers from igniting. The technology continues to work dry, which unlike other products allows for early deployment and evacuation of people. MFB also has developed a job site trailer allowing for the fire protection of property during the construction phase and fire hardening of the inner construction and installation of our patented system during that phase. The intent is for the home owner to be able to bind insurance to start a construction project. The Company has achieved USDA approval. It has sold products to various fire departments and continues to demonstrate a market for its products.

 

Going Concern

 

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) of the United States including the assumption of a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately $3.5 million, an accumulated deficit of $73 million as of the period end, and used cash in operations of approximately $343,660 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and negative working capital of $3.8 million. The Company expects to continue to incur significant expenditures to develop its operations. As such, there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Management recognizes that the Company must obtain additional resources to successfully develop its operations and implement its business plans. Through March 31, 2024, the Company has received funding in the form of the sale preferred stock subscriptions and historically loans from related parties. Management plans to continue to raise funds and/or refinance our indebtedness to support our operations in 2024 and beyond. However, no assurances can be given that we will be successful. If management is not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or refinance indebtedness, the implementation of the Company’s business plan, financial condition and results of operations will be materially affected These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.

 

 

                                                                   7



Table of Contents

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the unaudited interim financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Mighty Fire Breaker, LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability company. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments. 

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

For purposes of balance sheet presentation and reporting of cash flows, the Company considers all unrestricted demand deposits, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company had cash of $371,095 and $549,755 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Periodically, the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per institution. The amount in excess of the FDIC insurance as of March 31, 2024 was approximately $112,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make the required payments for services. Accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded. The remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the number of days the balance is past due, and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts.

 

Inventory

 

Inventories consist of raw materials which are stated at lower cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the weighted average method. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held inventories of $188,791 and $230,197, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded cost of goods sold of $89,872 and $13,854 associated with the cost of inventories sold, respectively. The Company did not write-off any inventories as unsalable during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

 

                                                                   8

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 

The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:

 

     ●    Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

           markets;

           

     ●    Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in

           the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities;

           and

           

     ●    Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own

           assumptions.

 

The Company’s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and loans payable, are carried at historical cost. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

 

Revenue

 

The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.

 

Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps:

 

     (i)  Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

     (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

     (iii)Determine the transaction price;

     (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

     (v)  Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

 

Our revenues currently consist of products used for lumber products for fire prevention. Revenue is recognized at a point in time, that is which the risks and rewards of ownership of the products transfer from the Company to the customer.

 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share

 

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the following common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive.

 

                                                                                                   March 31,          March 31,

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires, among other things, additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The expanded annual disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply the standard prospectively or retrospectively.

 

The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.

General Overview

 

The Company’s U.S. subsidiary, Mighty Fire Breaker LLC (“MFB”) is engaged in developing solutions to support the resolution of the insurance crisis in the western United States by use of its EPA approved CitroTech products. MFB has developed and patented additional intellectual property in this regard, such as a system for commercial properties and homes that puts a fire inhibiting buffer zone around a property, blocking blown-in embers from igniting. The technology continues to work dry, which unlike other products allows for early deployment and evacuation of people. MFB also has developed a job site trailer allowing for the fire protection of property during the construction phase and fire hardening of the inner construction and installation of our patented system during that phase. The intent is for the home owner to be able to bind insurance to start a construction project. The Company has achieved USDA approval. It has sold products to various fire departments and continues to demonstrate a market for its products.

Going Concern

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared (i) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and (ii) assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant income to date. The Company is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with no substantive revenue, as well as limitations on its operating capital resources. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In light of these matters, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to raise capital and generate revenue and profits in the future. 

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.

Our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:

 

     ●    Revenue Recognition

     ●    Incremental borrowing rate for Right of Use Assets

     ●    Share based compensation

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our revenues currently consist of products used for lumber products for fire prevention. Revenue is recognized at a point in time, that is which the risks and rewards of ownership of the products transfer from the Company to the customer. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.

 

Incremental borrowing rate for Right of Use Assets

 

As the Company’s operating leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate. The assessment of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate involves judgment regarding the cost of borrowing funds on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a similar economic environment.

 

Share-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued and those issued to nonemployees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the termination of service.

 

 

                                                                   21

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by one individual without adequate compensating controls.

 

A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

We expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.

 

Changes in Internal Controls

 

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
