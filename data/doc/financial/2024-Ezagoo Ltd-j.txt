NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had working capital deficit of $3,185,649 and accumulated deficit of $4,833,579, and had incurred a net loss of $94,665 and negative operating cashflows of $148,436 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through March 31, 2024 is dependent upon improving profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.

 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

 

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

 

● Basis of consolidated presentation

 

These condensed consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes, and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. The Company’s financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EZAGOO LIMITED and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

● Use of estimates

 

In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

● Reclassification

 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.

 

● Foreign currencies translation and re-measurement

 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations and comprehensive income.

 

The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying condensed financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company’s subsidiary in People’s Republic of China maintains its books and record in its local currency, Chinese Yuan (“RMB”), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.

 

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “Translation of Financial Statement”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the statements of stockholders’ deficit.

 

Translation of amounts from RMB into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

● Property and equipment

 

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:

SCHEDULE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES 

Office equipment           3-5 years

 

The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expenses as incurred, whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.

 

● Lease

 

The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842 Leases. The Company leases office space. The Company concludes on whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination as to whether an arrangement contains a lease is based on an assessment as to whether a contract conveys the right to the Company to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for period of time in exchange for consideration. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes these lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

The Company has assessed its contracts and concluded that its leases consist of only operating leases. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets, current portion of lease liabilities, and non-current portion of lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

 

ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company determines an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

● Revenue recognition

 

The Company assesses and follows the guidance of ASC 606, revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:

Under Topic 606, revenues are recognized when the promised services and goods have been confirmed and transferred to the consumers in amounts that reflect the consideration the customer expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company presents value added taxes (“VAT”) as reductions of revenues. The Company recognizes revenues net of value added taxes (“VAT”) and relevant charges.

 

During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s revenues were mainly generated from providing e-commerce trading of goods and products on ZCZX WeChat Application that is subscribed from Weimob (微盟集团, HK02013) (“trading income” since September 2022), providing e-commerce value-added service in LSM WeChat Application which is also subscribed from Weimob (微盟集团, HK02013) (“commission income” since November 2022), and providing service of travel planning to customer (“service income” since March 2024).

 

● Cost of revenues

 

Cost of revenue includes costs of goods sold and sales commissions expenses of e-commerce trading in ZCZX, the operating salaries for the staffs who running the ZCZX and LSM, and the service of travel planning.

 

● Imputed Interest

 

The Company owned director and related parties some loans which are unsecured, interest-free with no fixed payment term, for working capital purpose. Imputed interests were $0 and $27,489 for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

● Value-added taxes

 

Revenue is recognized net of value-added taxes (“VAT”). The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT rates applicable to the Company is 13% of e-commerce trading income and 6% of commission income and service income for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. All of the VAT returns filed by the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC, have been and remain subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities for five years from the date of filing. VAT payables are included in accrued liabilities.

 

● Income taxes

 

The Company followed the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recorded a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the change in tax rate.

 

The Company accounted for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. Interest and penalties related to unrecognizable tax benefit recognized in accordance with ASC 740 are classified in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as income tax expense.

 

● Earnings per share

 

The Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per share”. Basic EPS is measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Any potential common shares in 2024 and 2023 that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

 

● Commitments and contingencies

 

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.

 

● Related party transaction

A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.

 

Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.

 

                                                                  F-8

Additional Information

 

VIE STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENTS

 

Foreign ownership in companies providing media advertising services is subject to certain restrictions under PRC laws and regulations. To comply with the PRC laws and regulations, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Changsha Ezagoo Technology Limited (CETL), entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Beijing Ezagoo Zhicheng Internet Technology Limited (BEZL) and includes its branch company, named Changsha Branch of Beijing Ezagoo Industrial Development Group Holding Limited (BELCB), and its shareholders. The contractual arrangements between CETL, BEZL and shareholders of BEZL allow us to:

 

1.   exercise effective control over BEZL and BELCB whereby having the power to direct BEZL and BELCB’s activities that most

      significantly drive the economic results of BEZL and

      BELCB;

      

2.   receive substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns, and absorb substantially all the risks and expected

      losses from BEZL and BELCB as if it was their sole shareholder;

      and

      

3.   have an exclusive option to purchase all of the equity interests in BEZL and BELCB.

 

Our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of our company, our subsidiaries and our consolidated VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary. All transactions and balances among our company, our subsidiaries and our consolidated VIE have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

A subsidiary is an entity in which we, directly or indirectly, control more than one half of the voting powers; or has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors; or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of directors; or has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders.

 

A consolidated VIE is an entity in which we, or our subsidiaries, through contractual agreements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity. In determining whether we or our subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary, we considered whether it has the power to direct activities that are significant to the consolidated VIE’s economic performance, and also our obligation to absorb losses of the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the consolidated VIE or the right to receive benefits from the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the consolidated VIE. We hold all the variable interests of the consolidated VIE and its subsidiaries, and has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the consolidated VIE.

 

In accordance with the contractual agreements among between CETL, BEZL, BELCB and shareholders of BEZL and BELCB allow us to:

 

1.   exercise effective control over BEZL and BELCB whereby having the power to direct BEZL and BELCB’s activities that most

      significantly drive the economic results of

      BEZL;

      

2.   receive substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns, and absorb substantially all the risks and expected

      losses from BEZL and BELCB as if it was their sole

      shareholder;

      

3.   and have an exclusive option to purchase all of the equity interests in BEZL and BELCB.

 

We believe that the contractual arrangements among CETL, BEZL, BELCB and the shareholders of BEZL are in compliance with PRC law and are legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements and if the shareholders of our consolidated VIE were to reduce their interest in us, their interests may diverge from ours and that may potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act contrary to the contractual terms.

 

Our ability to control the consolidated VIE also depends on the voting rights proxy agreement and our company, through CETL, has to vote on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the consolidated VIE. As noted above, we believe this voting rights proxy agreement is legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity ownership.

Item 4 Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:

 

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
