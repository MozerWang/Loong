CHASE PACKAGING CORPORATION

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

MARCH 31, 2024 

 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

 

Chase Packaging Corporation (“the Company”), a Delaware Corporation, previously manufactured woven paper mesh for industrial applications and polypropylene mesh fabric bags for agricultural use, and distributed agricultural packaging manufactured by other companies. Management’s plans for the Company include securing a merger or acquisition, raising additional capital, and other strategies designed to optimize shareholder value. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts. The failure to achieve these plans will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The unaudited condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to provide for fair presentation and a reasonable understanding of the information presented. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes, as well as Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, previously filed with the SEC.

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of financial position as of March 31, 2024, and results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 or any future periods.

 

NOTE 2 - LIQUIDITY:

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $351,388 and $388,171, respectively, consisting of money market funds and U.S. Treasury Bills. Our net losses incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, amounted to $35,271 and $635,296, respectively, and we had working capital of $347,915 and $383,186 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for its business activities for at least the next twelve months and for the costs of seeking an acquisition of an operating business.

 

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents balances with high credit quality financial institutions. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash in insured accounts in the amount of $56,172 and $9,721, respectively, and cash equivalents (Treasury and government securities) held in financial institutions that were uninsured by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the amount of $295,216 and $378,450, respectively.

 

 

                                                                   7

Income Taxes

 

The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured assuming enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized.

 

The Company follows FASB Interpretation of “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated its tax positions and did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress.

 

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

 

Stock-based compensation expense incurred by the Company for employees and directors is based on the employee model of ASC 718, and the fair market value of the award is measured at the grant date. Under ASC 718 employee is defined as “An individual over whom the grantor of a share-based compensation award exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S. “tax regulations.” Our consultants do not meet the employer-employee relationship as defined by the IRS and therefore are accounted for under ASC 718 as amended by ASU 2018-07. As such, the grant date is the measurement date of an award’s fair value. Corresponding expenses for employee and non-employee services are recognized over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period.

 

Treasury Stock

 

The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method. There were 497,587 shares of Class A common stock held in treasury, purchased at a total cumulative cost of approximately $49,759, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

 

The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This standard requires a financial asset to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. We expect the financial assets of the Company in scope of ASU 2016-13 will primarily be accounts receivable. The Company will estimate an allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable that result from the inability of customers to make required payments. In estimating the allowance for expected credit losses, consideration will be given to the current aging of receivables, historical experience, and a review for potential bad debts. The Company adopted this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and it did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and disclosures.

 

The Company does not believe that other standards, which have been issued but are not yet effective, will have a significant impact on its financial statements.

 

NOTE 4 - BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE:

 

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the exercise of common stock equivalents.

 

We have excluded 6,909,000 common stock equivalents (warrants - Note 5) from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which, if included, would have an antidilutive effect.

2023 Extension of Warrant Terms

 

The Company, acting by resolution of its Board of Directors, amended and extended the expiration date of its outstanding warrants to purchase up to 6,909,000 shares of common stock to March 7, 2026. The terms of the warrants, including the exercise price of $0.15 per share, remain in effect without modification. The warrants modification expense of $345,450 was recorded as the incremental value of the modified warrants over the unmodified warrants on the modification date. Assumptions used in the Black Scholes option-pricing model for these warrants were as follows:

Exercisable at March 31, 2024                                                            6,909,000  $         0.15            1.93 

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the average remaining contractual life of the outstanding warrants was 1.93 years and 2.18 year, respectively. The warrants will expire on March 7, 2026. The intrinsic value of the warrants at March 31, 2024 was $276,360 due to the fair market value exceeding the exercise price of the common stock.

 

Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock 

 

The Company has authorized 4,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which 50,000 shares have been designated as Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding.

 

NOTE 6 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 61,882,172 common shares outstanding. Also outstanding were warrants relating to 6,909,000 shares of common stock, all totaling 68,791,172 shares of common stock and all common stock equivalents, outstanding at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

The Company did not incur any stock-based compensation or issue common or preferred stock or any other equity instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

NOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:

 

ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,” (“ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, not adjusted for transaction costs. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).

 

 

                                                                   9



Table of Contents

 

The three levels are described below:

 

Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that is accessible by the Company;

 

Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;

 

Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

 

There were no transfers in or out of any level during the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.

 

Except for those assets and liabilities which are required by authoritative accounting guidance to be recorded at fair value in the Company’s balance sheets, the Company has elected not to record any other assets or liabilities at fair value, as permitted by ASC 820. No events occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023 which would require adjustment to the recognized balances of assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

 

The Company determines fair values for its investment assets as follows:

 

Cash equivalents at fair value - the Company’s cash equivalents, at fair value, consist of money market funds - marked to market on reporting dates. The Company’s money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy since they are valued using quoted market prices from an exchange.

 

The following tables provide information on those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:

Other Income (Expense)

 

The following table presents our total Other Income (Expense) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

                                                                                                              Three Months Ended       

                                                                                                                  March 31,

                                                                                                            2024           2023      

                                                                                                                                     

Interest and other income                                                                               $       3,866  $       2,353 

Warrants modification expense                                                                                       —      (621,810 )

Other Income (Expense)                                                                                  $       3,866  $    (619,457)

 

Other income increased by $623,323 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was related to the decrease in warrants modification expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Net Loss

 

The Company had a net loss of $35,271 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with a net loss of $635,296 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Decrease in net loss was due primarily to the decrease in warrants modification expense, offset by the increase in professional fee. 

 

Loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $(0.00) and $(0.01) based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding.

 

It is anticipated that future operating expenses will decrease and then stabilize as the Company complies with its periodic reporting requirements; however, expenses may increase as the Company works to effect a business combination, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting a business combination.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $351,388, consisting of money market funds and U.S. Treasury and government securities maturing in 3 months or less. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for its business activities for at least the next twelve months and for the costs of seeking an acquisition of an operating business.

 

The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all years presented in this Report.

The cash used in operating activities of $9,736 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 principally resulted from our net loss of $635,296, as adjusted for a non-cash charge for warrants modification expense of $621,810, and a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3,750.

Not applicable.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

 

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.

 

We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting.

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, our internal control over financial reporting.
