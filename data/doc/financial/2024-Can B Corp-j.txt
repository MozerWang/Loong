PART 1 – FINANCIAL INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Financial Statements

 

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

 

The consolidated financial statements of Can B Corp. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries included in this Report have not been reviewed by an independent registered public accounting firm as required by Regulation S-X. On May 3, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission’) issued an order providing that BF Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”), the Company’s then independent registered public accounting firm, is currently not permitted to appear or practice before the Commission for reasons described in the Commission’s order. As a result, the Company dismissed BF Borgers as its independent registered public accounting firm effective May 6, 2024. The Company is in the process of engaging a new independent registered public accounting firm but as of the date of this Report such engagement had not been finalized.

Note 2 – Going Concern

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a “going concern” basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in a normal course of business. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $26,582 and negative working capital of $6,165,773. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had incurred losses of $5,049,933 and $1,739,038, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

After careful consideration and analysis of the economics, supply chain, processing logistics, and management of manpower the Company decided to consolidate operations in its CO operations in Mead and Ft. Morgan. The Company has very limited processing ability via 3rd party vendors to process its owned biomass into isolate.

 

As a result of the consolidation of the Florida and Tennessee operations into Fort Morgan, Colorado and the subsequent Article 9 auction sale of the primary hemp division assets, the Colorado operation has limited ability to process any materials other than through third party operations.

 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Note 3 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the management of the Company, as defined below, these unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein. Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year.

 

The consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). The interim consolidated financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K.

 

                                                                   7

Principles of Consolidation

 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein include the accounts of Can B Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in those financial statements. Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, income taxes and deferred taxes. Descriptions of these policies are discussed in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and adjusts when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

 

Significant Accounting Policies

 

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in “Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 

                                                                   8

Segment reporting

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company reports operating results and financial data in one operating and reportable segment. The Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, manages the Company as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration, provide comprehensive service offerings across the entire customer base, and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole. Although certain information regarding selected products or services is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of the Company’s business, the chief operating decision maker manages the Company and allocates resources at the consolidated level.

 

Reclassifications

 

Certain amounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassification adjustments had no effect on the Company’s previously reported net loss.

The Note requires the Company to use reasonable commercial efforts to complete an offering which will result in an uplisting of its common stock to a national securities exchange within a reasonable time following the issuance of the Note. The Note contains certain negative covenants, including a prohibition on the incurrence of debt that is senior or pari passu to the indebtedness represented by the Note, the creation of liens on the Company’s assets, the payment of dividends and other distributions on the Company’s common stock, the repurchase of the Company’s common stock, the sale of a significant portion of the Company’s assets and the repayment of indebtedness other than existing indebtedness.

 

The Company may elect to pay all or a portion of a monthly installment due under the Note by converting such amount into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $4.00 per share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Note. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted conversion price was $.0772. If the Company does not pay an installment when due it is deemed an election by the Company to convert the installment payment into common stock at a price equal to the lower of $4.00 per share or 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the common stock during the five trading days preceding the conversion date. WOMF has the right to determine the timing of any such conversion. WOMF may elect at any time to convert amounts payable under the Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Note. The Company did not pay the installments due under the Note on April 27, 2023, May 1, 2023, June 1, 2023, July 1, 2023, August 1, 2023 and September 1, 2023 in cash. As a result, these installment payments will be converted into common stock at such time as WOMF elects to effect the conversions.

 

If the Company receives cash proceeds from any source, including payments from customers or from the issuance of equity or debt, WOMF can require the Company to apply 100% of such proceeds to the repayment of the Note.

 

If the Company completes a placement of securities, WOMF will have the right to accept such new securities in lieu of the Note and Warrant. For so long as the Note is outstanding, if the Company issues a security or amends the terms of a security issued before the issue date of the Note, and WOMF believes that terms of the new or amended security are more favorable to the holder than the terms provided to WOMF, WOMF may require that such terms become part of WOMF’s transaction documents with the Company.

 

In the event of a default under the Note, the Company shall be required to pay WOMF an amount equal to the amount determined by multiplying the principal amount then outstanding plus default interest by 135%, plus costs of collection. WOMF may elect to accept payment of any such amount in cash and/or shares of the Company’s common stock, valued for this purpose at the lower of the conversion price then in effect or a 60% discount to the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock during the five trading days preceding the conversion date.

 

WOMF has been granted a right of first refusal to participate in future financing transactions conducted by the Company.

 

As additional consideration for the purchase of the Note, the Company issued WOMF a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 1,307,190 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to 90% of the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock during the five trading days preceding the date of exercise. The Warrant contains a cashless exercise provision and is exercisable at any time during the period beginning on August 27, 2023 and ending on August 27, 2028. In addition, a warrant issued by the Company to WOMF in August 2022 was amended to change the exercise price of the warrant from $5.40 per share to the lower of $5.40 per share or the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock during the five trading days preceding its exercise.

 

The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with WOMF pursuant to which the Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Note and the exercise of the Warrant for public resale. The Company filed the registration statement on May 12, 2023 and it was declared effective on May 22, 2023. WOMF has also been granted piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Note and the exercise of the Warrant. Each of the Note and Warrant grants full ratchet anti-dilution protection to WOMF in the event that the Company issues common stock or rights to purchase common stock at a price less than the conversion or exercise price then in effect.

 

In May 2023, the Company issued a promissory note to WOMF in the principal amount of $437,500. The purchase price of the note was $350,000, representing a 20% original issue discount. The note is non-interest bearing except in the event of a default, in which case interest will accrue at a rate of 40% per annum in the event of a payment default and 18% per annum in the event of other defaults. The note became due on October 15, 2023. The principal balance outstanding at March 31, 2024 was $256,893.

Forbearance and Amendment of Outstanding Notes.

 

Contemporaneous with the sale of the Note and Warrant to WOMF, ASOP and ASOF (collectively, “Arena”), who hold promissory notes with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $3,877,000 which became due on April 30, 2022 (the “Arena Notes”), entered into a Forbearance Agreement with the Company pursuant to which they agreed to forbear from exercising remedies under the Arena Notes until December 31, 2024 provided that the Company does not default on its obligations under the Forbearance Agreement. In September 2023, Arena notified the Company that it was in default of certain obligations under the Forbearance Agreement but did not declare an acceleration of the indebtedness.

 

The Forbearance Agreement requires the Company and/or Company’s subsidiaries, Duramed, Inc. and Duramed MI, LLC (together the “Duramed Subsidiaries”) to remit to Arena on a monthly basis certain accounts receivable collected by the Company and/or the Duramed Subsidiaries until the total amount collected is $5,700,000. After the amount collected is $5,700,000, additional collections of these receivables are shared equally between the Company and Arena. The Company and the Duramed Subsidiaries have assigned their rights to these receivables to Arena.

 

If Arena fully exercises warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock that were previously issued to it, and the aggregate market value of the shares acquired is less than $1,500,000, the Company must pay to Arena an amount equal to such difference.

 

In December 2023 Arena notified the Company that it intended to conduct an auction of certain of the Company’s assets under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code due to the alleged breaches of the Forbearance Agreement. The auction took place on March 14, 2024.

 

As a condition to the closing of the sale of the Note and Warrant to the WOMF, certain terms of certain promissory notes previously issued by the Company were amended, including the following:

 

     ●    in consideration of an increase in the aggregate principal amount by $10,000 and an increase in the interest rate to 18% per

           annum, the holder of notes in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000 agreed to waive his right to require the Company

           to repay a $50,000 note upon the Company’s receipt of $1,500,000 of financing and extend maturity dates from November 18,

           2021 and January 22, 2023 to September 1,

           2023;

           

     ●    in consideration of the Company’s agreement to provide a product credit for future orders of $50,000, the holder of a

           promissory note in the principal amount of $150,000 agreed to extend the maturity date from August 10, 2022 to September 1,

           2023;

           

     ●    the maturity date of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,250,000 was extended from August 12, 2022 until the

           earlier of September 1, 2023 or the date that the Company completes an offering resulting in an uplisting of its common

           stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market;

           and

           

     ●    in consideration of the repayment of a total of $232,500 under the notes, the holders of promissory notes in the aggregate

           principal amount of $435,000 issued in October and November 2022 that bore interest at 18% per annum and were past due

           agreed to exchange the notes for new notes that matured on September 1, 2023 and bear interest at 15% per

           annum;

 

                                                                   15

TWS Note

 

On August 12, 2021, pursuant to an Equipment Acquisition Agreement, the Company entered into a twelve-month promissory note of $1,250,000 with payments of $100,000 per month and interest at 6% (See Note 5). As of March 31, 2024, the total amount outstanding was $1,050,000.

 

WOMF October 2023 Note

 

On October 27, 2023, the Company completed the sale of a promissory note (the “Initial Note”) in the principal amount of $156,250 to WOMF pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and the WOMF (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). The purchase price of the Note was $125,000, representing a 20% original issue discount. The Initial Note is non-interest bearing, except in the case of the event of a default, in which case interest will accrue from the date of the default at a rate equal to the lower of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law. The Initial Note becomes due on October 27, 2024.

 

WOMF may elect to convert the principal amount of the Initial Note and default interest, if any, subject to adjustment at a price equal to 90% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the common stock during the fifteen trading days preceding the conversion date.

 

WOMF and/or investors introduced by WOMF may purchase up to an additional $1,693,750 aggregate principal amount of notes having terms substantially similar to the Initial Note (the “New Notes” and collectively with the Initial Note, the “Notes”). In addition to the principal and interest payment obligations under the Notes, the Company has agreed to pay and/or cause its newly formed 70% owned subsidiary, Nascent Pharma, LLC (“Nascent”,) to pay WOMF fifteen percent (15%) of all amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Company by Nascent until WOMF receives distributions in the aggregate amount that equal the sum of (a) 200% of the purchase price of notes previously issued by the Company to WOMF plus (b) 200% of the principal amount of certain notes previously issued by the Company and acquired by WOMF from a third party plus (c) 100% of the purchase price of Notes purchased pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement; provided, however, if WOMF and/or other investors purchase $1,875,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the obligation to pay 100% of the purchase price of the Notes shall be increased to 200% of the purchase price of such Notes. The amounts distributable by Nascent to the Company, if any, will represent the proceeds of Nascent’s enforcement of certain patents it is seeking to acquire. Nascent has not yet acquired such patents and no assurance can be given that it will be able to complete such acquisition. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the purchase of New Notes by WOMF and/or investors introduced by WOMF is subject to, among other things, Nascent’s acquisition of the patents. If Nascent does not complete the acquisition of the patents, the Company does not expect that any New Notes will be purchased and the Company will have no obligation to pay additional consideration to WOMF.

 

In the event of a default under a Note, the Company shall be required to pay the holder of the Note an amount equal to the amount determined by multiplying the principal amount of the Note then outstanding plus default interest by 135%, plus costs of collection. WOMF may elect to accept payment of any such amount in cash and/or shares of the Company’s common stock, valued for this purpose at the lower of the conversion price then in effect or a 60% discount to the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock during the five trading days preceding the conversion date.

 

WOMF has been granted a right of first refusal to participate in future financing transactions conducted by the Company.

 

The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with WOMF pursuant to which the Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission by December 11, 2023 to register for public resale the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Note and a consolidated note issued to WOMF in the principal amount of $1,354,210 (the “Consolidated Note”) which combined certain notes held by WOMF into a single Note. If the Company fails to file the registration statement by December 11, 2023 or have the registration statement declared effective by the deadlines set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to make a payment of 2% of the amount then owed under the Note and the Consolidated Note for each 30 day period after the applicable deadline that the Company does not file the registration statement or the registration statement is not declared effective. WOMF has also been granted piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes it acquires and the Consolidated Note. Each of the Initial Note and Consolidated Note grants full ratchet anti-dilution protection to WOMF in the event that the Company issues common stock or rights to purchase common stock at a price less than the conversion or exercise price then in effect.

 

The Initial Note contains and the New Notes will contain a provision which provides that the holder will not be converted if the conversion would result in the holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

 

ClearThink Notes

 

The Company issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $15,000 to ClearThink Capital Partners, LLC (“ClearThink”) in September 2023 for a purchase price of $10,000.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Can B̅ Corp. was originally formed as a Florida corporation on October 11, 2005, under the name of WrapMail, Inc. Effective January 5, 2015, we acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc., which the Company is in the process of dissolving. Effective December 28, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of Pure Health Products. In November 2018, we formed Duramed as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity.

 

The Company is in the business of promoting health and wellness through its development, manufacture and sale of products containing cannabinoids derived from hemp biomass and the licensing of durable medical devises. Can B̅’s products include oils, creams, moisturizers, isolate, gel caps, spa products, and concentrates and lifestyle products. Can B̅ develops its own line of proprietary products as well seeks synergistic value through acquisitions in the hemp industry. Can B̅ aims to be the premier provider of the highest quality hemp derived products on the market through sourcing the best raw material and offering a variety of products we believe will improve people’s lives in a variety of areas.

 

On March 14, 2024, an auction of the assets of our hemp division was conducted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code following allegations by Arena that we were in breach of our obligations under certain notes and a forbearance agreement. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

 

Following the auction, we have continued our hemp operations on a reduced scale using equipment provided by third parties and the services of third-party processors. Historically, revenues from our hemp division supported, in part, our durable medical equipment business conducted through Duramed. Due to reduced support from the hemp division, Duramed is operating with reduced staff which has adversely impacted revenues. While we plan to continue our hemp and durable medical equipment operations for the near term, our primary focus will be on protecting and commercializing the cannabis patents recently acquired by Nascent.

 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CANB and its operational wholly owned subsidiaries.

 

Results of Operations

 

Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Revenues decreased $622,609. The decrease largely due to the normalization of sales activity with 2022 positively impacted by the wind down of restrictions related to the Covid-19 Pandemic surrounding elective surgeries, enabling an increase in the usage of the Company’s Duramed product lines and ultrasound device associated with patient recovery.

 

Cost of product sales increased $668,584 due to inventory adjustments taken.

 

Operating expenses increased $1,817,561 as a result of loss on sale of property and equipment offset by decrease consulting fees, rent and other operating expenses.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $26,582 and negative working capital of $6,165,773. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $7,424. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, $216,851 was provided by operating activities and $224,275 was provided by operating activities

 

The Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.

 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

PART II- OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

On April 28, 2021, the Company was served with a commercial legal action against the Company and certain officers by David Weissberg and Donna Marino, who are investors in the Company (collectively, the “Investors”). The complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau, Index No. 605191/2021. The complaint alleges four causes of action.

 

The first cause of action alleges that the Company breached Securities Purchase Agreements with the Investors by failing to assist the Investors in getting opinion letters to remove the restrictive legends from their shares, even though the Company made introductions and requests to the Company’s counsel, provided supporting documents for the Investor’s shares, and ultimately the opinion letters could not be rendered because the Investors failed to submit required documentation to counsel.

 

The second cause of action is similar to the first but related to alleged misrepresentations regarding removing the restrictive legends from shares that were issued for services rather than purchased.

 

The third cause of action alleges that the Company mislead the Investors to invest $500,000. The final cause of action alleges that officers of the Company made misrepresentations regarding the value of the Company’s stock, which caused David Weissberg to owe more in taxes than he was expecting.

 

We have consulted with attorneys and believe the Investors’ claims are meritless, factually inaccurate, and frivolous. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the aforementioned legal action and will likely bring counterclaims against the Investors.

 

Approximately November 24, 2021, a vendor of the Company filed amended suit against the Company in Florida, Case No. 2021 CA 001797, for monies allegedly owed and civil theft relating to such monies and related products and fraud in the inducement. We do not believe we owe such vendor any amount. The court has entered a default judgement against the Company for our failure to timely answer the complaint, which default has since been overturned. Subsequently the case has been set for interrogatories and document production which activities are being fulfilled.

 

On or about August 11, 2022, a Complaint was filed by Evexia Plus, LLC against Can B Corp. in a product payment trade dispute. Case Number 63-CV-2022-900692.00 in the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County, AL. On 1-26-2023 the court ordered a Summary Judgement in the amount of $336,924. The parties are trying to work out a payment schedule tied to production to satisfy the judgement.

 

On December 1, 2023,the Company, received a notice from Arena Special Opportunities Partners I, LP, Arena Special Opportunities Fund, LP and Arena Investors, LP (collectively, the “Arena Entities” or “Arena”) advising that by virtue of defaults in the performance of the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries to the Arena Entities, the Arena Entities intended to conduct a public auction of certain assets of the Company and its subsidiaries under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

 

The Arena Entities collectively hold approximately $3,838,770 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the “Arena Notes”) issued by the Company. The Arena Entities previously notified the Company and its subsidiaries that they were in default of certain obligations under the Forbearance Agreement dated February 27, 2023 among the Company, its subsidiaries and the Arena Entities pursuant to which the Arena Entities agreed to forbear from exercising remedies under the Arena Notes until December 31, 2024 provided that no defaults occurred under the Arena Notes or the Forbearance Agreement. The alleged defaults include a failure to deliver account control agreements, failure to enter into a servicing agreement, failure to timely make certain payments and the unauthorized use and misuse of receivable assigned to the Arena Entities.

 

                                                                   21                                                                   



                                                         

 

On February 27, 2024, the Supreme Court, County of New York (the “Court”), denied a motion made by the Company seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the proposed sale. As a result of the decision, the Arena Entities proceeded with its proposed auction of the Company’s hemp division assets and the auction took place on March 14, 2024. Approximately $300,000 of proceeds were generated by the sale.

 

On April 7, 2024, Arena filed a complaint in the Court against the Company, it subsidiaries and certain officers of the Company and its subsidiaries alleging tortious interference with the auction and seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is in breach of the Arena Notes and the Forbearance Agreement and that Arena has the right to auction certain equipment held at a Company facility that is not owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company believes that Arena’s claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend Arena’s claims.

 

Other than above, we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings in which we are involved.

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 except as described below.

 

An auction of the assets of our hemp division was conducted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code following allegations by certain affiliated creditors that we were in breach of our obligations under certain notes and a forbearance agreement. See “Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”

 

Following the auction, we have continued our hemp operations on a reduced scale using equipment provided by third parties and the services of third-party processors. Historically, revenues from our hemp division supported, in part, our durable medical equipment business conducted through Duramed, Inc. Due to reduced support from the hemp division, Duramed, Inc. is operating with reduced staff which has adversely impacted revenues. While we plan to continue our hemp and durable medical equipment operations for the near term, our primary focus will be on protecting and commercializing the cannabis patents recently acquired by Nascent; however the impact of the auction on hemp and Duramed divisions increases the risk that we will not be able to continue as a going concern.

 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

 

In February 2024, the Company issued options to purchase 25,264,463 shares of it common stock at an exercise price of $.05 per share to officers, directors, employees and consultants. The Company relied upon the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in connection with these issuances.

 

In February 2024, the Company completed the sale of a promissory note in the principal amount of $75,000 to a creditor. The purchase price of the note was $50,000, representing a 33.33% original issue discount. The note becomes due on November 29, 2024 and bears interest, payable upon maturity, at a rate of 12% per annum. The holder may convert the purchase price of the note and accrued and unpaid interest into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time at a conversion price of $0.07743 per share. The Company relied upon the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with this transaction.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 11,045,387 shares of common stock upon the conversion of outstanding notes The Company relied upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with these issuances.

 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

 

In September 2023, Arena Special Opportunities Partners I, LP and Arena Special Opportunities Fund, LP provided notice to the Company that it is in default of certain terms of their Forbearance Agreement with the Company dated as of February 27, 2023 and thus have right to accelerate the payment of the Company’s obligations under the $3.8 million aggregate principal of notes held by them. In April 2024, the Arena entities filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is in breach of the Arena Notes and the Forbearance Agreement 

 

As of March 31, 2023, notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $7.8 million were past due.
