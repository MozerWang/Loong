CORNER GROWTH ACQUISITION CORP. 
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
MARCH 31, 2024 
Note 1—Description of Organization, Business Operations and Basis of Presentation 
Corner Growth Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on October 20, 2020. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 
Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends to focus on businesses in the technology industries primarily located in the United States. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 
As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through March 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, its initial public offering described below (the “Initial Public Offering”) and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for initial Business Combination candidates, and since the signing of the Business Combination Agreement described below, the completion of this proposed transaction. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and will recognize changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities as other income (loss). The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 
The registration statements for the Company’s Initial Public Offering were declared effective on December 16, 2020. On December 21, 2020, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 40,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”), included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of the overallotment option to purchase an additional 5,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $400,000,000 which is described in Note 3. 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 7,600,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) to CGA Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $11,400,000, which is described in Note 4. 
Transaction costs amounted to $22,766,081 consisting of $8,000,000 of underwriting fees, $14,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $766,081 of other offering costs. As further described in Note 5, effective December 20, 2022, in accordance with a fee reduction agreement, the underwriter agreed to irrevocably forfeit $10,000,000 of the aggregate $14,000,000 deferred fee that would otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant the underwriting agreement, resulting in a reduced deferred fee of $4,000,000, which shall be payable to the underwriter upon consummation of an initial business combination, as originally set forth in the underwriting agreement. 
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 21, 2020, an amount of $400,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, on March 28, 2024, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (i.e., in one or more bank accounts) until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders, as described below.
As more fully described in Note 5, on June 23, 2023, the Company and the underwriter agreed to terminate the December 20,2022 fee reduction agreement solely upon execution of a side letter. On June 23, 2023, in accordance with the duly executed side letter, the Company and the underwriter agreed that the underwriter will irrevocably forfeit $7,000,000 (instead of $10,000,000) of the aggregate $14,000,000 Original Fee that would otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, resulting in a reduced fee of $7,000,000, which shall be payable in cash by the Company to the underwriter upon consummation of a business combination, as originally set forth in the underwriting agreement. 
The Company will provide holders (the “Public Shareholders”) of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”), with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified 
 
5 

as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with ASC 480. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has the approval of an ordinary resolution. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) clear all trades with the Company’s legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. 
Extraordinary General Meetings 
On December 20, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the “December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting”), which amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from December 21, 2022 to June 21, 2023 (the “December 2022 Extension Amendment Proposal”). The shareholders approved the December 2022 Extension Amendment Proposal and on December 28, 2022 the Company filed the articles amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. The shareholders approved a proposal to amend the trust agreement to change the date on which Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company must commence liquidation of the Trust Account from (A) the earlier of the Company’s completion of an initial business combination and December 21, 2022 to (B) the earlier of the Company’s completion of an initial business combination and June 21, 2023. In connection with the December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders elected to redeem 38,808,563 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the Trust Account totaling $393,676,799, or approximately $10.14 per share which includes $5,591,169 of earnings in the Trust Account not previously withdrawn. In January 2023, the Company made redemption payments of $3,262,655 out of the Trust Account that were due to the redeeming shareholders who elected to redeem their shares as part of the December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting. This amount was reflected as due to shareholders in the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to the redemptions, 1,191,437 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding until the June 2023 Extraordinary General Meeting further described below. 
On June 15, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which was adjourned and reconvened on June 20, 2023 (the “June 2023 Extraordinary General Meeting”), to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from June 21, 2023 to March 20, 2024 or such earlier date as shall be determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion (such proposal, the “June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal”), (ii) eliminate from the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association the limitation that the Company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”) and (iii) amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to provide that Class B ordinary shares may be converted either at the time of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination or at any earlier date at the option of the holders of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal”). The shareholders of the Company approved the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal at the Extension Meeting and on June 21, 2023, the Company filed the articles amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 
In connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal, shareholders elected to redeem 771,499 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the trust account totaling $8,085,078, or approximately $10.48 per share which includes $370,088 of earnings in the trust account not previously withdrawn. Subsequent to the redemptions, 419,938 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding until the February 2024 Extraordinary General Meeting further described below.

On June 21, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Founder Conversion Amendment, our sponsor, the holder of an aggregate of 9,825,001 shares of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, elected to convert 9,825,000 shares of the Class B ordinary shares held by it on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares of the Company, with immediate effect. Following such conversion, the Sponsor holds 9,825,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares and 1 share of Class B ordinary shares and the Company will have an aggregate of 10,244,938 shares of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (419,938 of which are subject to possible redemption) and 175,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. In connection with the conversion, the sponsor has agreed to certain transfer restrictions, a waiver of redemption rights, a waiver of any right to receive funds from the trust account and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. 
On February 29, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “February 2024 Extraordinary General Meeting”), to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from March 20, 2024 to June 30, 2024 (the “Extended Date”) or such earlier date as shall be determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion (such proposal, the “February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal” and, together with the December 2022 Extension Amendment Proposal and the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the “Extension Proposals”). The shareholders of the Company approved the February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal and the Company filed the articles amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 
In connection with the vote to approve the February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal, shareholders elected to redeem 83,349 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the trust account totaling $911,508, or approximately $10.94 per share which includes $78,018 of earnings in the trust account not previously withdrawn. Subsequent to the redemptions, 10,161,589 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding. 
Nasdaq Notice and Hearing 
On December 18, 2023, the Company received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Company’s securities (units, shares and warrants) would be subject to suspension and delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on December 27, 2023, due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. The Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the notice. 
Nasdaq granted the Company’s hearing request, which hearing request stayed the suspension of trading of the Company’s securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concluded and the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued a written decision. A hearing on the matter was held on March 14, 2024. 
On March 15, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued written notice of its decision to grant the Company’s request for an exception to its listing deficiencies until June 17, 2024 in view of the Company’s substantial steps toward closing its previously announced initial business combination and its plan for achieving compliance with Nasdaq listing rules upon closing of the transaction for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 
On May 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Second Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company no longer meets the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) (the “Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement”). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company has 45 days, or until June 24, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement. 
Business Combination Agreement 
The Company has entered into a Business Combination Agreement, dated May 4, 2023 (the “Original BCA Date”), as amended and restated on December 29, 2023 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among the Company, Noventiq Holdings PLC, an exempted company limited by shares registered by way of continuation under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Noventiq”), Noventiq Holding Company, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Parent”), Noventiq Merger 1 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent that has elected to be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“Company Merger Sub”), and Corner Growth SPAC Merger Sub, Inc., an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Noventiq Merger Sub”), which provides, among other things, that (i) the Company will merge with and into Company Merger Sub (the “Company Merger”), with Company Merger Sub surviving the Company Merger and (ii) Noventiq Merger Sub will merge with and into Noventiq (the “Noventiq Merger,” and together with the Company Merger, the “Mergers”), with Noventiq surviving the Noventiq Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the transactions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) the “Business Combination,” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Transactions”). 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company Class B ordinary share shall be converted into one Company Class A ordinary share. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and at the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company Class A ordinary share shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive one Parent ordinary share. At the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company warrant (the “Company Warrants”) issued and outstanding, entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Company Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment), will be converted into the right to receive a warrant to purchase one Parent ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment) upon consummation of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and at the effective time of the Noventiq Merger, each Noventiq ordinary share shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive (i) such number or fraction of newly issued Parent ordinary shares that is equal to the Share Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and (ii) one Class A CSR (as defined below), one Class B CSR (as defined below) and one Class C CSR (as defined below) in each case, for each one whole Parent ordinary share issuable to such holder pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement at the effective time of the Noventiq Merger. 
On April 18, 2024, the Company announced an offer to exchange certain global depositary receipts (“GDRs”) representing Noventiq ordinary shares in consideration for newly issued ordinary shares (the “Exchange Offer”), which Exchange Offer expired on May 10, 2024. To provide for the terms of the Exchange Offer, on May 13, 2024, the Company and Noventiq entered into Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (“Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA”), by and between the Company and Noventiq. Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA provides, among other things, that (i) the outstanding shares underlying the GDRs are to be excluded for purposes of determining the Per Share Merger Equity Consideration Value (as defined in the BCA) and (ii) Noventiq shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accept the forfeit and/or surrender and cancellation, as soon as reasonable practicable, of Noventiq’s outstanding shares underlying the GDRs that it acquired pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Each reference to the A&R BCA shall be deemed a reference to the A&R BCA, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA. 
On October 28, 2020, CGA Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to the Company and Noventiq to cover certain expenses in consideration for 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), of the Company. In November 2020, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 such Class B ordinary shares of the Company to each of the Company’s three independent directors (Alexandre Balkanski, John Mulkey, and Jason Park) in recognition of, and as compensation for, their future services to the Company. On December 16, 2020, the Company effected a share capitalization, resulting in 10,062,500 Founder Shares issued and outstanding as of such date. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Company Initial Public Offering”), 62,500 Founder Shares were forfeited for no consideration on December 23, 2020, resulting in 10,000,000 Founder Shares outstanding, of which, as of such date, 9,825,001 Founder Shares were held by the Sponsor and 58,333 Founder Shares were held by each of the Company’s three independent directors. As of the date of the amending and restating of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor held 9,825,001 Founder Shares. Of these, 5,000,000 Company ordinary shares will be forfeited upon consummation of the Business Combination, and 1,500,000 Company ordinary shares (the “Alignment Shares”) are subject to forfeiture based on the gross proceeds raised from additional financings contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, if any, by the Company and the cash balance of the Company’s trust account held for the benefit of its public shareholders as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, but the consummation of the Business Combination is not subject to a minimum amount of additional financing having been raised. If (i) the cash balance of the Company’s trust account and the gross proceeds received from investors in additional financings (the “Additional Financing Investors”) is equal to or greater than $25 million upon consummation of the Business Combination, and (ii) the gross proceeds received from Additional Financing Investors is equal to or greater than $50 million prior to the date that is 180 days following the closing of the Business Combination, none of the Alignment Shares will be forfeited. An additional 2,000,000 Company ordinary shares (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”) will be held in escrow and only released, in three equal instalments, upon the occurrence of certain milestone events as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger, 3,800,000 Company Warrants held by the Sponsor shall be forfeited and returned to the Company for cancellation.

Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a support agreement with the Company and Noventiq (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to, among other things, (i) vote in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) not to solicit, initiate, submit, facilitate (including by means of furnishing or disclosing information), discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with any third-party with respect to a CGAC Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement); (iii) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to its shares in the Company prior to the closing of the Proposed Business Combination; (iv) not to transfer any of the Restricted Securities (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement) from and after the Closing and until the earlier of (A) the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the date following the Closing Date on which the Company completes a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement). 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, Noventiq and certain shareholders of Noventiq (collectively, the “Noventiq Supporting Shareholders”) duly executed and delivered to the Company a support agreement (the “Voting and Support Agreement”), pursuant to which each Noventiq Supporting Shareholder agreed to, among other things, (i) the Business Combination and the adoption of the Business Combination Agreement any other matters necessary or reasonably requested by Noventiq for consummation of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, (ii) not to transfer any Noventiq Shares on or prior to the Closing (subject to the exceptions set forth therein), and (ii) to a lock-up of the Noventiq Shares from and after the Closing and until the earlier of (A) the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the date following the Closing Date on which the Company completes a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Voting and Support Agreement). 
The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, at or prior to the Closing, the Company, the Sponsor Parties and certain Noventiq shareholders will enter into the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and such Noventiq shareholders will be granted certain registration rights with respect to their respective Ordinary Shares of the Company, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. 
The Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “initial shareholders”) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with its initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by June 30, 2024 (the “Combination Period”) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law.
The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders or members of the Company’s management team acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination during the Combination Period and, in such event, such amount will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only the $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
Liquidity and Going Concern 
As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $21,531 in its operating bank accounts, $3,697,791 in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its ordinary shares in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $4,990,531. 
Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. Based on its current cash and working capital balances, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its needs through the consummation of a Business Combination. 
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. The terms of such loans have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. However, as discussed in Note 4, as of March 31, 2024, the Company is indebted to the Sponsor and its affiliates for $2,192,961, which represents $1,912,961 of operating and formation costs paid by these related parties on the Company’s behalf, along with $280,000 of unpaid administrative fees. The Sponsor is not under any obligation to make additional expenditures on the Company’s behalf. 
In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, “Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern” management has determined that the date for mandatory liquidation and dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically a working capital deficiency and other adverse key financial ratios. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts or classification of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after June 30, 2024, our scheduled liquidation date if we do not complete the Business Combination prior to such date. There is no assurance that the Company will complete the Proposed Business Combination with Noventiq before June 30, 2024, or at all.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. 
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account 
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in cash or in money market mutual funds in U.S. based trust accounts at Morgan Stanley with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. 
The Company accounts for its securities held in the Trust Account in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 320 “Investments—Debt Securities.” These securities are classified as trading securities with unrealized gains or losses recognized through other income. The Company values its securities held in the Trust Account based on quoted prices in active markets (see Note 8 for more information). 
Warrant Liabilities 
The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the unaudited condensed statements of operations. 
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 
The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed balance sheet. 
Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the remeasurement from initial book value to redemption amount. The change in the carrying value of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. 
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption reflected in the condensed balance sheets are reconciled in the following table: 
 

                                                                                  Shares       Amounts

Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption - March 31, 2024             336,589  $   3,697,791 
                                                                                             
                                                                                                           
                                                                                             
In connection with the vote to approve the February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal, shareholders elected to redeem 83,349 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the trust account totaling $911,508, or approximately $10.94 per share. $78,018 was paid out to redeeming Class A ordinary shares as their proportionate share of trust earnings through the redemption date and is the difference between the redemption amount per share and the original $10.00 per share times the number of shares redeemed.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company remeasured the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to increase the carrying amount by $55,782 to reflect current earnings of the Trust Account.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage of $250,000. At March 31, 2024, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts. 
Emerging Growth Company 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 
This may make comparison of the Company’s condensed financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
Fair value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. 
 
12 

Income Taxes 
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the condensed financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company’s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company’s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. 
There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman Islands income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s condensed financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 
Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share 
Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 20,933,333 of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share for all periods presented, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per share is the same as basic net income (loss) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in dollars, except share amounts):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. For emerging growth companies, the new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2023, with no impact to its condensed financial statements because the Company does not have financial assets within the scope of ASU 2016-13.

The Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements. 
Note 3 — Initial Public Offering 
Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 40,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the partial exercise by the underwriter of the overallotment option to purchase an additional 5,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 6). 
Note 4 — Related Party Transactions 
Founder Shares 
On October 28, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share. In November 2020, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of the Company’s independent directors. On December 16, 2020, the Company effected a share capitalization of 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 10,062,500 Class B Ordinary Shares outstanding. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 62,500 Class B Ordinary for no consideration, resulting in 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
On June 21, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Founder Conversion Amendment, our sponsor, the holder of an aggregate of 9,825,001 shares of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, elected to convert 9,825,000 shares of the Class B ordinary shares held by it on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares of the Company, with immediate effect. Following such conversion, the Sponsor holds 9,825,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares and 1 share of Class B ordinary shares. The Company will have an aggregate of 10,161,589 and 10,244,938 shares of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (336,589 and 419,938 of which are subject to possible redemption) and 175,000 and 175,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In connection with the conversion, the sponsor has agreed to certain transfer restrictions, a waiver of redemption rights, a waiver of any right to receive funds from the trust account and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. 
The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares or Class A ordinary shares received upon conversion thereof until the earlier of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.  
The Company’s Founder Shares are subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in a letter agreement with the Company entered into by the initial stockholders, and officers and directors. The Sponsor has the right to transfer its ownership in the Founder Shares at any time, and to any transferee, to the extent that the Sponsor determines, in good faith, that such transfer is necessary to ensure that it and/or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates are in compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial stockholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor transferred 150,000 Founder Shares to our three independent directors in recognition of and as compensation for their future services to the Company. The transfer of Founder Shares 
 
14 

to these directors is within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance-based vesting condition (i.e. the consummation of a business combination) is probable of achievement under the applicable accounting literature. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the consummation of a business combination, in an amount equal to the number of Founder Shares times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the transfer of the Founder Shares. As of March 31, 2024, the lock-up provisions have not been remediated and are not probable to be remediated. Any such agreements may be subject to certain conditions to closing, such as approval by the Company’s shareholders. As a result, the Company determined that, taking into account that there is a possibility that the Business Combination might not happen, no stock-based compensation expense should be recognized through March 31, 2024. 
Private Placement Warrants 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,600,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $11,400,000. Each warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. 
The Sponsor and the Company’s officers and directors agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. 
Working Capital Loans 
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors, may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant. As of the date of this filing, March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no borrowings under any Working Capital Loans. 
Administrative Services Agreement 
Pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “Administrative Services Agreement”) entered into on December 17, 2020, the Company agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $40,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the Company’s management team until the earlier of (A) the Company’s completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) on December 21, 2022, an amount equal to $960,000 less the actual amount paid under the Administrative Services Agreement. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $0 and $0, respectively, which is included in operating and formation costs on the unaudited condensed statements of operations. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $280,000 and 280,000 in fees outstanding for these services, respectively, that are included in due to related party on the condensed balance sheets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on November 18, 2021, the Sponsor permanently waived its right to receive any of the Company’s outstanding, and all of the Company’s remaining, payment obligations under the Administrative Services Agreement. 
Operating and Formation Costs 
As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor also paid operating and formation costs of $1,912,961 and $1,630,848, respectively, on behalf of the Company which are due on demand. These amounts are included in due to related party on the condensed balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Sponsor is not under any obligation to make additional expenditures on the Company’s behalf.

Note 5 — Commitments and Contingencies 
Registration Rights 
The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and securities that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any, are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered in connection with the Initial Public Offering. These holders are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, these holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 
As further described in Note 1 and as such terms used herein are defined therein, the Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, at or prior to the Closing, the Company, the Sponsor and certain Noventiq shareholders will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and such Noventiq shareholders will be granted certain registration rights with respect to their respective Ordinary Shares, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. 
Underwriting Agreement 
After the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters were entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $14,000,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Effective December 20, 2022, in accordance with a fee reduction agreement, the underwriter agreed to irrevocably forfeit $10,000,000 of the aggregate $14,000,000 deferred fee that would otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant the underwriting agreement, resulting in a reduced deferred fee of $4,000,000, which shall be payable to the underwriter upon consummation of a Business Combination, as originally set forth in the underwriting agreement. The Company accounted for this forfeiture during the fourth calendar quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022.
On June 23, 2023, the Company and the underwriter agreed to terminate the December 20, 2022 fee reduction agreement solely upon execution of a side letter in accordance with the duly executed Mutual Termination of Initial Fee Reduction Agreement. On June 23, 2023, in accordance with the duly executed Side Letter to Underwriting Agreement, the Company and the underwriter agreed to the following: 
 
     1.    Cantor will irrevocably forfeit $7,000,000 (instead of $10,000,000) of the aggregate $14,000,000 Original Fee that would
            otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, resulting in a reduced fee of $7,000,000 (the
            “Fee”), which shall be payable in cash by the Company to Cantor upon consummation of a Business Combination, as originally
            set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
            
 
     2.    In addition, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company shall pay to the Underwriter a non-refundable
            cash fee equal to 3.0% of:
            
• (x) the aggregate maximum gross proceeds received or receivable in connection with any Equity Financing, including, without limitation, aggregate amounts committed by investors to purchase securities, whether or not all securities are issued upon consummation of the Business Combination, plus 
• (y) the gross proceeds received by the Company upon exercise of any warrants or other securities issued in connection with such Financing that are convertible into common stock of the Company; 
• the aggregate maximum principal amount of debt committed or available to be committed or available in connection with the Debt Financing (including, without limitation, in the case of an offering of debt securities, the aggregate maximum principal amount of securities committed to be purchased by investors), whether or not drawn down (or, in the case of an offering of debt securities, whether or not purchased) upon consummation of the business Combination; and 
• any proceeds received from the Trust Account in connection with the Business Combination. 
The fees noted in items 1 and 2 above are contingent upon a successful completion of a Business Combination. There is no assurance that a Business Combination will be consummated by the Extended Date (or any such later date of termination approved in accordance with the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association). In accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, the Company is required to record its best estimate of the loss if the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The fee amount noted in item 2 cannot be reasonably estimated or determinable at this time and as a result, is not recorded in the financial statements. 
Finder’s Fee Arrangement 
In connection with the Proposed Business Combination, a portion of the founder shares will be distributed under an agreement with a third party dated as of April 28, 2023 that constitutes a finder’s fee arrangement (the “Finder’s Fee Arrangement”). The Finder’s Fee Arrangement provides for our sponsor to make a $2 million cash payment to the third party and provide an option to purchase an economic interest in 2,000,000 membership units of the sponsor contingent on the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination, which are accounted for under the guidance in ASC 718. Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. Compensation expense related to such shares is recognized only when the performance-based vesting condition (i.e. the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination) is probable of achievement under the applicable accounting literature. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination, in an amount equal to the number of such shares times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the transfer of such shares. The Company will reflect the transactions in its financial statements when the Proposed Business Combination is consummated as the sponsor is a principal shareholder in the Company and the Company benefits from the Finder’s Fee Arrangement. If the Proposed Business Combination does not close for any reason, and a termination fee is actually paid by Noventiq to the Company, the Sponsor or their affiliates, then the third party will be entitled to receive a $2,000,000 cash payment. Not withstanding the foregoing, to the extent the termination fee is not sufficient to cover the $2,000,000 cash payment, then the Sponsor and the third party will share the balance in an amount to be reasonably agreed to at the time. The Finder’s Fee Arrangement included potential compensation payable to the third party. 
 
16

On March 14, 2024, the Finder’s fee Arrangement was amended and restated which no longer provides the third party an option to purchase an economic interest in 2,000,000 membership units of the sponsor contingent on the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination. Instead, the parties have agreed that once the Sponsor has received ordinary shares from a successfully completed transaction and any earnouts or other contingent releases thereto, it shall distribute shares to the third party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Sponsor operating agreement and the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the $2,000,000 cash payment to third party will be paid by Noventiq instead of the Sponsor and will be denominated as a Company transaction expense. In the event the Proposed Business Combination is not consummated and the Sponsor receives a termination fee, the third party shall receive $1,000,000 as complete satisfaction of the cash payment. 
Note 6 — Warrant Liabilities 
The Public Warrants will become exercisable at $11.50 per share on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and, following the effective date of the registration statement, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital-raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the initial shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the initial shareholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, plus interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume-weighted average trading price of the Class A ordinary shares during the 10-trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of 
 
17

the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the Public Warrants for redemption (except with respect to the Private Placement Warrants if they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees): 
 
                   •     in whole and not in part; 
 
                   •     at a price of $0.01 per warrant; 
 
                   •     upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; and 
 
                   •     if, and only if, the last reported sale price (the “closing price”) of the Class A ordinary shares equals or
                          exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the
                          third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant
                          holders.
                          
In addition, once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the warrants for redemption: 
 
                   •     in whole and not in part; 
 
                   •     at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will
                          be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of Class
                          A ordinary shares to be determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the
                          “fair market value” of the Class A ordinary shares;
                          
 
                   •     if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as
                          adjusted) for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the
                          Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
                          
 
                   •     if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period
                          ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the
                          warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must also be
                          concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.
                          
The “fair market value” of the Class A ordinary shares for the above purpose shall mean the volume-weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. In no event are the warrants to be exercisable in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). 
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management has the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. Additionally, in no event is the Company be required to net cash settle any Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 
Following the Closing, the Company’s public warrants, issued under a Warrant Agreement, dated December 16, 2020, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, will remain outstanding and are expected to continue trading on Nasdaq. 
Note 7 — Shareholders’ Deficit 
Preference Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors.

Following such conversion, the Sponsor holds 9,825,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares and at December 31, 2023, the Company has an aggregate of 10,244,938 shares of Class A ordinary shares (419,938 of which are subject to possible redemption) issued and outstanding.

Holders are entitled to one vote for each Class B ordinary share. At December 31, 2022, there were 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. On June 21, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Founder Conversion Amendment, the Sponsor elected to convert 9,825,000 shares of the Class B ordinary shares held by it on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares of the Company, with immediate effect.

The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis (as adjusted). In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, 20% of the sum of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares issued upon completion of the Initial Public Offering plus the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. 
Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements 
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: 
 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market
          in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
          on an ongoing
          basis.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar
          assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not
          active.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
          liability.

The Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within the warrant liabilities on the condensed balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of the warrant liabilities in the condensed statements of operations. 
Initial Measurement and Subsequent Measurement 
The Company established the initial fair value for the Public Warrants on December 21, 2020, the date of the consummation of the Company’s Initial Public Offering, using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one Public Warrant), (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, and (iii) the issuance of shares of Class B ordinary shares, based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. The Warrants were classified as Level 3 at the initial measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs. 
The Warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is classified as Level 1 due to quoted prices in an active market since February 8, 2021. The Private Placement Warrants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are classified as Level 2 due to the use of quoted prices for similar assets that are not active. 
As of March 31, 2024, the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were determined to be $0.15 and $0.15 per warrant for aggregate values of approximately $2.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were determined to be $0.06 and $0.06, respectively, per warrant for aggregate values of approximately $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 
The following table presents the changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities:

Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the Private Placement Warrant liability for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. There were no transfers in or out of level 3 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Private Placement Warrants were valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and were transferred out of Level 3. 
Note 9 — Subsequent Events 
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred up to the date condensed financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events, not previously disclosed, that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements, except as described below.

Overview 
We are a blank check company incorporated on October 20, 2020 (inception) as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we focus on industries that complement our management team’s background, and in our search for targets for our Business Combination seek to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the technology industry in the United States and other developed countries. 
The registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on December 16, 2020. On December 21, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 40,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $400,000,000, and incurring offering costs of approximately $22,766,000, inclusive of $14,000,000 in deferred underwriting commissions. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant, each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of 7,600,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant (the “Private Placement”) to our sponsor, CGA Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $11,400,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable for one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and private placement, $400,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the private placement were placed in the Trust Account, located in the United States at UBS Financial Services Inc. and Morgan Stanley, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and are only invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the assets held in the Trust Account. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied toward consummating an initial Business Combination. 
Extraordinary General Meetings 
On December 20, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the “December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting”), which amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from December 21, 2022 to June 21, 2023. The shareholders approved a proposal to amend the trust agreement to change the date on which Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company must commence liquidation of the Trust Account from (A) the earlier of the Company’s completion of an initial business combination and December 21, 2022 to (B) the earlier of the Company’s completion of an initial business combination and June 21, 2023. In connection with the December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders elected to redeem 38,808,563 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the

Trust Account totaling $393,676,799, or approximately $10.14 per share which includes $5,591,169 of earnings in the Trust Account not previously withdrawn. In January 2023, the Company made redemption payments of $3,262,655 out of the Trust Account that were due to the redeeming shareholders who elected to redeem their shares as part of the December 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting. Subsequent to the redemptions, 1,191,437 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding until the June 2023 Extraordinary General Meeting described below. 
On June 15, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which was adjourned and reconvened on June 20, 2023 (the “June 2023 Extraordinary General Meeting”), to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from June 21, 2023 to March 20, 2024 or such earlier date as shall be determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion (such proposal, the “June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal”), (ii) eliminate from the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association the limitation that the Company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”) and (iii) amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to provide that Class B ordinary shares may be converted either at the time of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination or at any earlier date at the option of the holders of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal”). The shareholders of the Company approved the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal at the June 2023 Extraordinary General Meeting and on June 21, 2023, the Company filed the articles amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 
In connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Conversion Amendment Proposal, shareholders elected to redeem 771,499 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the trust account totaling $8,085,078, or approximately $10.48 per share which includes $370,088 of earnings in the trust account not previously withdrawn. Subsequent to the redemptions, 419,938 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding until the February 2024 Extraordinary General Meeting further described below. 
On June 21, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Founder Conversion Amendment, our sponsor, the holder of an aggregate of 9,825,001 shares of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, elected to convert 9,825,000 shares of the Class B ordinary shares held by it on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares of the Company, with immediate effect. Following such conversion, the Sponsor holds 9,825,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares and 1 share of Class B ordinary shares and the Company will have an aggregate of 10,244,938 shares of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (419,938 of which are subject to possible redemption) and 175,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. In connection with the conversion, the sponsor has agreed to certain transfer restrictions, a waiver of redemption rights, a waiver of any right to receive funds from the trust account and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. 
On February 29, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “February 2024 Extraordinary General Meeting”), to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from March 20, 2024 to June 30, 2024 (the “Extended Date”) or such earlier date as shall be determined by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion (such proposal, the “February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal” and, together with the December 2022 Extension Amendment Proposal and the June 2023 Extension Amendment Proposal, the “Extension Proposals”). The shareholders of the Company approved the February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal and the Company filed the articles amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 
In connection with the vote to approve the February 2024 Extension Amendment Proposal, shareholders elected to redeem 83,349 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in redemption payments out of the trust account totaling $911,508, or approximately $10.94 per share which includes $78,018 of earnings in the trust account not previously withdrawn. Subsequent to the redemptions, 10,161,589 Class A ordinary shares remained issued and outstanding. 
Nasdaq Notice and Hearing 
On December 18, 2023, the Company received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Company’s securities (units, shares and warrants) would be subject to suspension and delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on December 27, 2023, due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. The Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the notice. 
Nasdaq granted the Company’s hearing request, which hearing request stayed the suspension of trading of the Company’s securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concluded and the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued a written decision. A hearing on the matter was held on March 14, 2024. 
On March 15, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued written notice of its decision to grant the Company’s request for an exception to its listing deficiencies until June 17, 2024 in view of the Company’s substantial steps toward closing its previously announced initial business combination and its plan for achieving compliance with Nasdaq listing rules upon closing of the transaction for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 
On May 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Second Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company no longer meets the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) (the “Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement”). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company has 45 days, or until June 24, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement. 
Business Combination Agreement
The Company has entered into a Business Combination Agreement, dated May 4, 2023 (the “Original BCA Date”), as amended and restated on December 29, 2023 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among the Company, Noventiq Holdings PLC, an exempted company limited by shares registered by way of continuation under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Noventiq”), Noventiq Holding Company, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Parent”), Noventiq Merger 1 Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent that has elected to be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“Company Merger Sub”), and Corner Growth SPAC Merger Sub, Inc., an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Noventiq Merger Sub”), which provides, among other things, that (i) the Company will merge with and into Company Merger Sub (the “Company Merger”), with Company Merger Sub surviving the Company Merger and (ii) Noventiq Merger Sub will merge with and into Noventiq (the “Noventiq Merger,” and together with the Company Merger, the “Mergers”), with Noventiq surviving the Noventiq Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the transactions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) the “Business Combination,” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Transactions”). 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company Class B ordinary share shall be converted into one Company Class A ordinary share. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and at the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company Class A ordinary share shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive one Parent ordinary share. At the effective time of the Company Merger, each Company warrant (the “Company Warrants”) issued and outstanding, entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Company Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment), will be converted into the right to receive a warrant to purchase one Parent ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment) upon consummation of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and at the effective time of the Noventiq Merger, each Noventiq ordinary share shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive (i) such number or fraction of newly issued Parent ordinary shares that is equal to the Share Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and (ii) one Class A CSR (as defined below), one Class B CSR (as defined below) and one Class C CSR (as defined below) in each case, for each one whole Parent ordinary share issuable to such holder pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement at the effective time of the Noventiq Merger. 
On April 18, 2024, the Company announced an offer to exchange certain global depositary receipts (“GDRs”) representing Noventiq ordinary shares in consideration for newly issued ordinary shares (the “Exchange Offer”), which Exchange Offer expired on May 10, 2024. To provide for the terms of the Exchange Offer, on May 13, 2024, the Company and Noventiq entered into Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (“Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA”), by and between the Company and Noventiq. Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA provides, among other things, that (i) the outstanding shares underlying the GDRs are to be excluded for purposes of determining the Per Share Merger Equity Consideration Value (as defined in the BCA) and (ii) Noventiq shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accept the forfeit and/or surrender and cancellation, as soon as reasonable practicable, of Noventiq’s outstanding shares underlying the GDRs that it acquired pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Each reference to the A&R BCA shall be deemed a reference to the A&R BCA, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to A&R BCA. 
On October 28, 2020, CGA Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to the Company and Noventiq to cover certain expenses in consideration for 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), of the Company. In November 2020, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 such Class B ordinary shares of the Company to each of the Company’s three independent directors (Alexandre Balkanski, John Mulkey, and Jason Park) in recognition of, and as compensation for, their future services to the Company. On December 16, 2020, the Company effected a share capitalization, resulting in 10,062,500 Founder Shares issued and outstanding as of such date. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Company Initial Public Offering”), 62,500 Founder Shares were forfeited for no consideration on December 23, 2020, resulting in 10,000,000 Founder Shares outstanding, of which, as of such date, 9,825,001 Founder Shares were held by the Sponsor and 58,333 Founder Shares were held by each of the Company’s three independent directors. As of the date of the amending and restating of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor held 9,825,001 Founder Shares. Of these, 5,000,000 Company ordinary shares will be forfeited upon consummation of the Business Combination, and 1,500,000 Company ordinary shares (the “Alignment Shares”) are subject to forfeiture based on the gross proceeds raised from additional financings contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, if any, by the Company and the cash balance of the Company’s trust account held for the benefit of its public shareholders as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, but the consummation of the Business Combination is not subject to a minimum amount of additional financing having been raised. If (i) the cash balance of the Company’s trust account and the gross proceeds received from investors in additional financings (the “Additional Financing Investors”) is equal to or greater than $25 million upon consummation of the Business Combination, and (ii) the gross proceeds received from Additional Financing Investors is equal to or greater than $50 million prior to the date that is 180 days following the closing of the Business Combination, none of the Alignment Shares will be forfeited. An additional 2,000,000 Company ordinary shares (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”) will be held in escrow and only released, in three equal instalments, upon the occurrence of certain milestone events as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger, 3,800,000 Company Warrants held by the Sponsor shall be forfeited and returned to the Company for cancellation.

The Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, following the receipt of the required approval by the Company’s and Noventiq’s shareholders and the fulfilment of other customary closing conditions, such as the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form F-6 registering the ADSs (as defined in Note 1 to the notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements). There is no assurance that the Proposed Business Combination will be consummated by the Extended Date (as defined below) (or any such later date of termination approved in accordance with the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association). 
If we are unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay for our income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of our company, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
On April 2, 2024, Jerome “Jerry” Letter provided written notice to the Company of his resignation as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Letter’s resignation was not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. Concurrently therewith, the Company’s current Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marvin Tien, was appointed as acting Chief Financial Officer for the Company. Mr. Tien will retain his roles as Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
On April 3, 2024, Noventiq issued a press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Letter as Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development for Noventiq. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. 
Additionally, on April 3, 2024, Noventiq issued a press release announcing unaudited operating highlights for the nine months ended December 31, 2023. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein. 
On April 3, 2024 and April 29, 2024, Noventiq provided supplemental information regarding the Business Combination (as defined below) in an investor presentation. Copies of the presentations are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and Exhibit 99.4, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein. 
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 
As indicated in the accompanying condensed financial statements, at March 31, 2024, we had $21,531 in our operating bank account, and a working capital deficit of $4,990,531, and $331,901 of earnings and realized gains on the amounts remaining in the Trust Account after historical redemptions. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our initial Business Combination plans. 
Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the proceeds of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares, and loans from the Sponsor of approximately $120,000. The loan was repaid in full on December 22, 2020. Subsequent from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds received from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement. 
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. The terms of such loans have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. However, as discussed in Note 4 to the notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements, as of March 31, 2024, the Company is indebted to the Sponsor and its affiliates for $2,192,961, which represents $1,912,961 of operating and formation costs paid by these related parties on the Company’s behalf, along with $280,000 of unpaid administrative fees. The Sponsor is not under any obligation to make additional expenditures on the Company’s behalf. 
Based on the foregoing, management believes that we will not have sufficient working capital to meet our needs through the consummation of a Business Combination. Over this time period, we will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.

In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, “Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern”, management has determined that the date for mandatory liquidation and dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through a reasonable period of time, which is considered one year from the issuance of these condensed financial statements. The Company demonstrates other adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these condensed financial statements. These other adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically working capital deficiency and other adverse key financial ratios. Our scheduled liquidation date is June 30, 2024. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts or classification of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after June 30, 2024. There is no assurance that the Company will complete the Proposed Business Combination with Noventiq before June 30, 2024, or at all.

Results of Operations 
Our entire activity since inception through March 31, 2024 related to our formation, Initial Public Offering and, since the closing of our Initial Public Offering, the search for initial Business Combination candidates (see Note 1 to the notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements). As of March 31, 2024, $21,531 was held outside the Trust Account and was being used to fund the Company’s operating expenses. We are not generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination at the earliest. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $2,513,203, which consisted of earnings and realized gains on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $55,782, offset by a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,863,067, and $705,918 in operating and formation costs. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $2,381,252, which consisted of earnings and realized gains on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $154,783, offset by a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,884,000 and $652,035 in operating and formation costs. 
Related Party Transactions 
Founder Shares 
On October 28, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”). In November 2020, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of the Company’s independent directors. On December 16, 2020, the Company effected a share capitalization of 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 10,062,500 Class B Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as of such date. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, 62,500 Founder Shares were forfeited for no consideration on December 23, 2020, resulting in 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. 
On June 21, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Founder Conversion Amendment, our sponsor, the holder of an aggregate of 9,825,001 shares of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, elected to convert 9,825,000 shares of the Class B ordinary shares held by it on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares of the Company, with immediate effect. Following such conversion, the Sponsor holds 9,825,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares and 1 share of Class B ordinary shares. The Company will have an aggregate of 10,161,589 and 10,244,938 shares of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (336,589 and 419,938 of which are subject to possible redemption) and 175,000 and 175,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In connection with the conversion, the sponsor has agreed to certain transfer restrictions, a waiver of redemption rights, a waiver of any right to receive funds from the trust account and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. 
The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares or Class A ordinary shares received upon conversion thereof until the earlier of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 
The Company’s Founder Shares are subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in a letter agreement with the Company entered into by the initial stockholders, and officers and directors. The Sponsor has the right to transfer its ownership in the Founder Shares at any time, and to any transferee, to the extent that the Sponsor determines, in good faith, that such transfer is necessary to ensure that it and/or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates are in compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial stockholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor transferred 150,000 Founder Shares to our three independent directors in recognition of and as compensation for their future services to the Company. The transfer of Founder Shares to these directors is within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance-based vesting condition (i.e. the consummation of the business combination) is probable of achievement under the applicable accounting literature. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the consummation of the business combination, in an amount equal to the number of Founder Shares times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the transfer of the Founder Shares. As of March 31, 2024, the lock-up provisions have not been remediated and are not probable to be remediated. Any such agreements may be subject to certain conditions to closing, such as approval by the Company’s shareholders. As a result, the Company determined that, taking into account that there is a possibility that the Business Combination might not happen, no stock-based compensation expense should be recognized through March 31, 2024.

Working Capital Loans 
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that a Business Combination is not completed, we may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. As of the date of this filing and March 31, 2024, there were no outstanding Working Capital Loans under this arrangement. 
Administrative Services Agreement 
We agreed, commencing on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $40,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the Company’s management team until the earlier of (A) the Company’s completion of the initial Business Combination or December 21, 2022 and (B) on December 21, 2022, an amount equal to $960,000, less the actual amount paid under the Administrative Services Agreement. On November 18, 2021, the Sponsor waived its right to receive any of the Company’s remaining, payment obligations under the Administrative Services Agreement. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred $0 in fees for these services. For the three ended March 31, 2023, the Company incurred $0 in fees for these services, respectively, which is included in operating and formation costs on the unaudited condensed statements of operations. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $280,000 and $280,000 in fees outstanding for these services that are included in due to related party on the condensed balance sheets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on November 18, 2021, the Sponsor permanently waived its right to receive any of the Company’s outstanding, and all of the Company’s remaining, payment obligations under the Administrative Services Agreement. 
Operating and Formation Costs 
As of March 31, 2024, the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor also paid operating and formation costs of $1,912,961 on behalf of the Company which are due on demand. These amounts are included in due to related party on the condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2024. The Sponsor is not under any obligation to make additional expenditures on the Company’s behalf. 
Contractual Obligations 
Registration and Shareholder Rights 
The holders of founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any, will be entitled to registration rights (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion of such shares into Class A ordinary shares) pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement entered into during the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and “piggyback” registration and shareholder rights. However, the registration and shareholder rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement 
The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, at or prior to the Closing, the Company, the Sponsor and certain Noventiq shareholders will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and such Noventiq shareholders will be granted certain registration rights with respect to their respective Ordinary Shares, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

Sponsor Support Agreement 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a support agreement with the Company and Noventiq (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to, among other things, (i) vote in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) not to solicit, initiate, submit, facilitate (including by means of furnishing or disclosing information), discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with any third-party with respect to a CGAC Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement); (iii) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to its shares in the Company prior to the closing of the Proposed Business Combination; (iv) not to transfer any of the Restricted Securities (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement) from and after the Closing and until the earlier of (A) the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the date following the Closing Date on which the Company completes a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement). 
Underwriting Agreement 
The underwriter was entitled to underwriting discounts of $0.20 per unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, or $8,000,000 in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. An additional fee of $0.35 per unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, or $14,000,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. Effective December 20, 2022, in accordance with a fee reduction agreement, the underwriter agreed to irrevocably forfeit $10,000,000 of the aggregate $14,000,000 deferred fee that would otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant the underwriting agreement, resulting in a reduced deferred fee of $4,000,000. The deferred underwriting commissions will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The Company accounted for this forfeiture during the fourth calendar quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022. 
As more fully described in Note 5, on June 23, 2023, the Company and the underwriter agreed to terminate the December 20, 2022 fee reduction agreement solely upon execution of a side letter. On June 23, 2023, in accordance with the duly executed side letter, the Company and the underwriter agreed that the underwriter will irrevocably forfeit $7,000,000 (instead of $10,000,000) of the aggregate $14,000,000 Original Fee that would otherwise be payable to it in cash pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, resulting in a reduced fee of $7,000,000, which shall be payable in cash by the Company to the underwriter upon consummation of a business combination, as originally set forth in the underwriting agreement. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and are fully described in Note 2 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We believe those accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our condensed financial statements. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies from our Form 10-K. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. For emerging growth companies, the new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2023, with no impact to its condensed financial statements because the Company does not have financial assets within the scope of ASU 2016-13. 
Our management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. 
JOBS Act 
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the condensed financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the principal executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. 
 
Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
Item 4.     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim condensed financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the Company’s management has concluded that the controls around the interpretation and accounting for certain complex financial instruments were not effectively designed or maintained. Furthermore, the Company’s management has concluded that the controls around the communication by executive management of all material agreements were not effectively designed or maintained. 
Management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of effective controls related to the recording and disclosure of accrued and contingent liabilities and their related expenses. This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our deferred underwriting fee payable, accumulated deficit, and transaction costs which effect the total liabilities, total shareholders’ deficit, net income (loss) and basic and diluted net income (loss) per Class A redeemable, Class A nonredeemable and Class B ordinary shares as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
To respond to this material weakness, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable procedures to accrue and record liabilities, we plan to enhance these processes by increasing the communication between executive management and those responsible for accounting and reporting of all executed agreements that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include increased communication among our executive management and accounting personnel through conducting on-site meetings, virtual meetings the execution of meeting minutes and completion of procedural checklists. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 
We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations

in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION 
 
Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
None. 
 
Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider our risk factors from those disclosed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as disclosed below. 
Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
Our units are currently listed on the Nasdaq and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants may also be listed following their date of separation. Although after giving effect to our Initial Public Offering we meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be, listed on the Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in shareholders’ equity (generally $2,500,000), a minimum number of publicly traded securities (500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). 
Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the Nasdaq initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq. For instance, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our shareholders’ equity would generally be required to be at least $5.0 million and we would be required to have a minimum of 300 round lot holders of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those listing requirements at that time. If the Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 
                   •     a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 
                   •     reduced liquidity for our securities; 
 
                   •     a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in
                          our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of
                          trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
                          
 
                   •     a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
 
                   •     a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because our units and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq, our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 
On December 18, 2023, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that our securities (units, shares and warrants) would be subject to suspension and delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on December 27, 2023, due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. 
We timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the notice. Nasdaq granted our hearing request, which hearing request stayed the suspension of trading of our securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concluded and the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued a written decision. A hearing on the matter was held on March 14, 2024. 
On March 15, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel issued written notice of its decision to grant tour request for an exception to our listing deficiencies until June 17, 2024 in view of our substantial steps toward closing our previously announced business combination and our plan for achieving compliance with Nasdaq listing rules upon closing of the transaction for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 
On May 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Second Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company no longer meets the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) (the “Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement”). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company has 45 days, or until June 24, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Publicly Held Shares Requirement. 
 
Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
None. 
 
Item 3.     Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
None. 
 
Item 4.     Mine Safety Disclosures 
Not applicable. 
 
Item 5.     Other Information 
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
