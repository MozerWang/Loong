NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1—BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND OTHER INFORMATION

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of 1847 Holdings LLC (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X. They do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 25, 2024. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Discontinued Operations 

 

On February 26, 2024, Asien’s Appliance, Inc. (“Asien’s”), a wholly owned subsidiary of 1847 Asien Inc. (“1847 Asien”), entered into a general assignment (the “Assignment Agreement”), for the benefit of its creditors, with SG Service Co., LLC (the “Assignee”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Asien’s transferred ownership of all or substantially all of its right, title, and interest in, as well as custody and control of, its assets to the Assignee in trust. The results of operations of Asien’s are reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements relate solely to continuing operations and exclude all discontinued operations. See Note 3 for additional information.

 

The Company evaluates all disposal transactions to determine whether such disposal qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, “Discontinued Operations.” A disposal of a component or a group of components is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results when the following occurs: (1) a component (or group of components) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; (2) the component or group of components is disposed of by sale; or (3) the component or group of components is disposed of other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spin-off). For any component classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or other than by sale, qualifying for presentation as a discontinued operation, the Company reports the results of operations of the discontinued operations (including any gain or loss recognized on the disposal or loss recognized on classification as held for sale of a discontinued operation), less applicable income taxes (benefit), as a separate component in the consolidated statement of operations for current and all prior periods presented. The Company also reports assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheet for prior periods.

 

Reclassifications

 

Certain reclassifications within operating expenses have been made to the prior period’s financial statements to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. There is no impact in total to the results of operations and cash flows in all periods presented.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

 

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring; (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are to be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

The Company currently believes there are no other issued and not yet effective accounting standards that are materially relevant to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2—LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN ASSESSMENT

 

Management assesses liquidity and going concern uncertainty in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements to determine whether there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital, including available borrowings on loans, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date the financial statements are issued, which is referred to as the “look-forward period,” as defined in GAAP. As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to management, management considered various scenarios, forecasts, projections, estimates and made certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, its ability to delay or curtail expenditures or programs and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, management made certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent it deems probable those implementations can be achieved and management has the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $577,608 and total working capital deficit of $17,142,230. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred an operating loss of $3,109,631 and used cash flows in operating activities from continuing operations of $3,529,228.

 

The Company has generated operating losses since its inception and has relied on cash on hand, sales of securities, external bank lines of credit, and issuance of third-party and related party debt to support cashflows from operations. The Company expects that within the next twelve months, it will not have sufficient cash and other resources on hand to sustain its current operations or meet its obligations as they become due unless it obtain additional financing. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

An assessment was performed to determine whether there were conditions or events that, considered in the aggregate, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Initially, this assessment did not consider the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that had not been fully implemented. Based on this assessment, substantial doubt exists regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Management plans to address these concerns by securing additional financing through debt and equity offerings. Management assessed the mitigating effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans would be effectively implemented within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued and when implemented, would mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These plans are subject to market conditions and reliance on third parties, and there is no assurance that effective implementation of the Company’s plans will result in the necessary funding to continue current operations and satisfy current debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern beyond one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

 

NOTE 3—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

 

On February 26, 2024, Asien’s entered into an Assignment Agreement, for the benefit of its creditors. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Asien’s transferred ownership of all or substantially all of its right, title, and interest in, as well as custody and control of, its assets to the Assignee in trust. The Company received no cash consideration related to the assignment. Following the assignment, the Company retained no financial interest in Asien’s.

 

The assignment of Asien’s represents a strategic shift and its results are reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognized a gain on disposition of Asien’s of $1,060,095, as a separate line item in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Warrants

 

Warrants Issued in Public Equity Offering

 

On February 14, 2024 (as described above), the Company closed on a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers and a placement agency agreement with Spartan, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to such purchasers prefunded warrants for the purchase of 3,174,063 common shares at an exercise price of $0.01 per common share.

 

The Company evaluated the prefunded warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the prefunded warrants and applicable authoritative guidance from the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480 and ASC 815-40. The Company determined the prefunded warrants issued failed the indexation guidance under ASC 815-40, specifically, the prefunded warrants provide for a Black-Scholes value calculation in the event of certain transactions (“Fundamental Transactions”), which includes a floor on volatility utilized in the value calculation at 100% or greater. The Company has determined that this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s own equity shares. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 815-40, the Company recorded the fair value of the warrants as a liability upon issuance and marked to market each reporting period in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations until their exercise or expiration (see Note 9).

 

The fair value of the warrants deemed to be a liability, due to certain contingent put features, was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was deemed to be an appropriate model due to the terms of the warrants issued, including a fixed term and exercise price. The assumptions used in the model were as follows: (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility of 149.05%; (iii) risk-free interest rate of 4.86%; (iv) expected life of one year; (v) estimated fair value of the common shares of $1.95 per share; (vi) exercise price of $0.01.

 

Exercise Price Adjustments to Warrants

 

As a result of the issuance of common shares in the offering on February 14, 2023, the exercise price of certain of the Company’s outstanding warrants was adjusted to $1.00 pursuant to certain antidilution provisions of such warrants (down round feature). As a result, the Company recognized a deemed dividend of $1,000, which was calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Below is a table summarizing the changes in warrants outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2024:

Subject to shareholder approval (as defined below), the note is convertible into common shares at the option of the holder at any time on or following the date that an event of default (as defined in the note) occurs at a conversion price equal to 90% of the lowest volume weighted average price of the Company’s common shares on any trading day during the five (5) trading days prior to the conversion date; provided that such conversion price shall not be less than $0.01. The conversion price of the note is subject to standard adjustments, including a price-based adjustment in the event that the Company issues any common shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price, subject to certain exceptions.

 

The warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date that is the six months after the date of issuance and until the fifth anniversary thereof at an exercise price of $2.69 (subject to standard adjustments for share splits, share combinations, share dividends, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations and similar transactions) and may be exercised on a cashless basis if at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the issuance of common shares upon exercise thereof.

 

Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the Company is required to hold a special meeting of its shareholders on or before the date that is ninety (90) calendar days after an event of default occurs for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval of the issuance of all common shares underlying the note in excess of 1,058,040 common shares, or 19.99% of the common shares outstanding as of the date of the note. In addition, the note and the warrant contain an ownership limitation, such that the Company shall not effect any conversion or exercise, and the holder shall not have the right to convert or exercise, any portion of the note or the warrant to the extent that after giving effect to the issuance of common shares upon conversion or exercise, such holder, together with its affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares upon conversion or exercise, which such percentage may be increased or decreased by the holder, but not in excess of 9.99%, upon at least 61 days’ prior notice to the Company.

 

In connection with the private placement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement to register all common shares underlying the note and the warrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by May 31, 2024 and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within ninety (90) days after the filing thereof. If the Company fails to meet these deadlines or comply with certain other requirements in the registration rights agreement, then on each date that the Company fails to comply, and on each monthly anniversary thereof, the Company shall pay to the investor an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate subscription amount paid by the investor, subject to an aggregate cap of 10%. If the Company fails to pay any of these amounts in full within seven (7) days after the date payable, the Company must pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law).

 

Spartan Capital Securities, LLC acted as placement agent in connection with the private placement and received a warrant for the purchase of a number of common shares equal to eight percent (8%) of the number common shares initially issuable upon conversion of the note and exercise of the warrant at an exercise price of $2.959 per share (subject to adjustment), which is exercisable at any time on or after the date that is the six months after the date of issuance and until the fifth anniversary thereof.

 

Promissory Note

 

On May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to such investor a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 in a private placement transaction. The note accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum and is due and payable on May 9, 2025; provided that upon an event of default (as defined in the note), such rate shall increase to 16% per annum. The Company may voluntarily prepay the note in full at any time prior to the date that an event of default occurs. In addition, if, at any time prior to the full repayment of the note, the Company receives cash proceeds from any source or series of related or unrelated sources, including but not limited to, from payments from customers, the issuance of equity or debt, the issuance of securities pursuant to an equity line of credit (as defined in the note) or the sale of assets, the investor will have the right in its sole discretion to require the Company to immediately apply up to 100% of such proceeds to repay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest (including any default interest) then due under the note. The note is unsecured and has priority over all other unsecured indebtedness. The note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type.

Overview

 

We are an acquisition holding company focused on acquiring and managing a group of small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million, in a variety of different industries headquartered in North America.

 

On May 28, 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Asien Inc., or 1847 Asien, acquired Asien’s Appliance, Inc., a California corporation, or Asien’s. Asien’s has been in business since 1948 serving the North Bay area of Sonoma County, California. It provides a wide variety of appliance services, including sales, delivery/installation, in-home service and repair, extended warranties, and financing. Its main focus is delivering personal sales and exceptional service to its customers at competitive prices.

 

On February 26, 2024, Asien’s entered into a general assignment, for the benefit of its creditors, with SG Service Co., LLC, or the Assignee. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Asien’s transferred ownership of all or substantially all of its right, title, and interest in, as well as custody and control of, its assets to the Assignee in trust. Following the assignment, we retained no financial interest in Asien’s. Accordingly, the results of operations of Asien’s are reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

On September 30, 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet Inc., or 1847 Cabinet, acquired Kyle’s Custom Wood Shop, Inc., an Idaho corporation, or Kyle’s. Kyle’s is a leading custom cabinetry maker servicing contractors and homeowners since 1976 in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding area. Kyle’s focuses on designing, building, and installing custom cabinetry primarily for custom and semi-custom builders.

 

On March 30, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Wolo Inc., or 1847 Wolo, acquired Wolo Mfg. Corp., a New York corporation, and Wolo Industrial Horn & Signal, Inc., a New York corporation (which we collectively refer to as Wolo). Headquartered in Deer Park, New York and founded in 1965, Wolo designs and sells horn and safety products (electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment), and offers vehicle emergency and safety warning lights for cars, trucks, industrial equipment and emergency vehicles.

 

On October 8, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet acquired High Mountain Door & Trim Inc., a Nevada corporation, or High Mountain, and Sierra Homes, LLC d/b/a Innovative Cabinets & Design, a Nevada limited liability company, or Innovative Cabinets. Headquartered in Reno, Nevada and founded in 2014, High Mountain specializes in all aspects of finished carpentry products and services, including doors, door frames, base boards, crown molding, cabinetry, bathroom sinks and cabinets, bookcases, built-in closets, and fireplace mantles, among others, working primarily with large homebuilders of single-family homes and commercial and multi-family developers. Innovative Cabinets is headquartered in Reno, Nevada and was founded in 2008. It specializes in custom cabinetry and countertops for a client base consisting of single-family homeowners, builders of multi-family homes, as well as commercial clients.

 

On February 9, 2023, our subsidiary 1847 ICU Holdings Inc., or 1847 ICU, acquired ICU Eyewear Holdings, Inc., a California corporation, and its subsidiary ICU Eyewear, Inc., a California corporation, which we collectively refer to as ICU Eyewear. Headquartered in Hollister, California and founded in 1956, ICU Eyewear specializes in the sale and distribution of reading eyewear and sunglasses, blue light blocking eyewear, sun readers, and other outdoor specialty sunglasses, as well as select health and personal care items, including face masks.

 

Through our structure, we offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals to make and grow regular distributions to our common shareholders and increase common shareholder value over time.

 

We seek to acquire controlling interests in small businesses that we believe operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, and that have positive and stable earnings and cash flows, face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence and have strong management teams largely in place. We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us to be an attractive purchaser of their businesses. We make these businesses our majority-owned subsidiaries and actively manage and grow such businesses. We expect to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements.

Recent Developments

 

OID Note Extension

 

On April 11, 2024, we and the holders of the 20% OID subordinated promissory notes originally issued on August 11, 2023 entered into amendments to the notes, pursuant to which the parties agreed to extend the maturity date of these notes to July 10, 2024. As additional consideration for the amendments, we agreed to increase the outstanding principal by 20% of the outstanding principal amounts of the notes as an amendment fee.

 

Private Placement

 

On May 8, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we issued and sold to such investor a 20% OID subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $625,000 and a warrant for the purchase of 92,937 common shares for a total purchase price of $500,000 in a private placement transaction.

 

The note is due and payable on August 8, 2024. We may voluntarily prepay the note in full at any time. In addition, if we consummate any sale of a material amount of assets of our company or any of its subsidiaries, then the net proceeds thereof shall be applied to the payment or prepayment of the note. The note is unsecured and has priority over all other unsecured indebtedness, except for certain senior indebtedness (as defined in the note). The note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type.

 

Subject to shareholder approval (as defined below), the note is convertible into common shares at the option of the holder at any time on or following the date that an event of default (as defined in the note) occurs at a conversion price equal to 90% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our common shares on any trading day during the five (5) trading days prior to the conversion date; provided that such conversion price shall not be less than $0.01. The conversion price of the note is subject to standard adjustments, including a price-based adjustment in the event that we issue any common shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price, subject to certain exceptions.

 

The warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date that is the six months after the date of issuance and until the fifth anniversary thereof at an exercise price of $2.69 (subject to standard adjustments for share splits, share combinations, share dividends, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations and similar transactions) and may be exercised on a cashless basis if at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the issuance of common shares upon exercise thereof.

 

Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, we are required to hold a special meeting of shareholders on or before the date that is ninety (90) calendar days after an event of default occurs for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval of the issuance of all common shares underlying the note in excess of 1,058,040 common shares, or 19.99% of the common shares outstanding as of the date of the note. In addition, the note and the warrant contain an ownership limitation, such that we shall not effect any conversion or exercise, and the holder shall not have the right to convert or exercise, any portion of the note or the warrant to the extent that after giving effect to the issuance of common shares upon conversion or exercise, such holder, together with its affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares upon conversion or exercise, which such percentage may be increased or decreased by the holder, but not in excess of 9.99%, upon at least 61 days’ prior notice to us.

 

In connection with the private placement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with the investor, pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement to register all common shares underlying the note and the warrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by May 31, 2024 and use our best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within ninety (90) days after the filing thereof. If we fail to meet these deadlines or comply with certain other requirements in the registration rights agreement, then on each date that we fail to comply, and on each monthly anniversary thereof, we shall pay to the investor an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate subscription amount paid by the investor, subject to an aggregate cap of 10%. If we fail to pay any of these amounts in full within seven (7) days after the date payable, we must pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law).

 

Spartan Capital Securities, LLC acted as placement agent in connection with the private placement pursuant and received a warrant for the purchase of a number of common shares equal to eight percent (8%) of the number common shares initially issuable upon conversion of the note and exercise of the warrant at an exercise price of $2.959 per share (subject to adjustment), which is exercisable at any time on or after the date that is the six months after the date of issuance and until the fifth anniversary thereof. 

 

Promissory Note

 

On May 9, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we issued and sold to such investor a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 in a private placement transaction. The note accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum and is due and payable on May 9, 2025; provided that upon an event of default (as defined in the note), such rate shall increase to 16% per annum. We may voluntarily prepay the note in full at any time prior to the date that an event of default occurs. In addition, if, at any time prior to the full repayment of the note, we receive cash proceeds from any source or series of related or unrelated sources, including but not limited to, from payments from customers, the issuance of equity or debt, the issuance of securities pursuant to an equity line of credit (as defined in the note) or the sale of assets, the investor will have the right in its sole discretion to require us to immediately apply up to 100% of such proceeds to repay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest (including any default interest) then due under the note.

Management Fees

 

On April 15, 2013, we and our manager entered into a management services agreement, pursuant to which we are required to pay our manager a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% of our adjusted net assets for services performed (which we refer to as the parent management fee). The amount of the parent management fee with respect to any fiscal quarter is (i) reduced by the aggregate amount of any management fees received by our manager under any offsetting management services agreements with respect to such fiscal quarter, (ii) reduced (or increased) by the amount of any over-paid (or under-paid) parent management fees received by (or owed to) our manager as of the end of such fiscal quarter, and (iii) increased by the amount of any outstanding accrued and unpaid parent management fees. We did not expense any parent management fees for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Following the assignment of Asien’s assets to the Assignee in trust on February 26, 2024, our manager ceased to provide services to 1847 Asien for quarterly management fees. 1847 Asien expensed management fees of $50,000 and $75,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in discontinued operations.

 

On August 21, 2020, 1847 Cabinet entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager, which was amended on October 8, 2021. Pursuant to the amended management services agreement, our manager will provide certain services to 1847 Cabinet in exchange for a quarterly management fee. This fee will be the greater of $125,000 or 2% of adjusted net assets (as defined within the amended management services agreement). 1847 Cabinet expensed management fees of $125,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

On March 30, 2021, 1847 Wolo entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager. Pursuant to the management services agreement, our manager will provide certain services to 1847 Wolo in exchange for a quarterly management fee. This fee will be the greater of $75,000 or 2% of adjusted net assets (as defined within the management services agreement). 1847 Wolo expensed management fees of $75,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

On February 9, 2023, 1847 ICU entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager. Pursuant to the management services agreement, our manager will provide certain services to 1847 ICU in exchange for a quarterly management fee. This fee will be the greater of $75,000 or 2% of adjusted net assets (as defined within the management services agreement). 1847 ICU expensed management fees of $75,000 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

In addition, if the aggregate amount of management fees paid or to be paid to our manager under the offsetting management services agreements, exceeds, or is expected to exceed, 9.5% of our gross income in any fiscal year or the parent management fee in any fiscal quarter, then the management fee to be paid by such entities shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis determined by reference to the other management fees to be paid to our manager under other offsetting management services agreements.

 

On a consolidated basis, our company expensed total management fees from continued operations and discontinued operations of $275,000 and $50,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, our company expensed $200,000 and $75,000 in total management fees from continued operations and discontinued operations, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $577,608. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from operations, cash proceeds from financing activities, borrowings, and equity contributions by our shareholders.

 

Management plans to address the above as needed by, securing additional bank lines of credit, and obtaining additional financing through debt or equity transactions. Management has implemented tight cost controls to conserve cash.

 

The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and to eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if our company is unable to continue as a going concern. If our company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

 

We believe additional funds are required to execute our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses. The funds required to execute our business plan will depend on the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction. The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries. We will seek growth as funds become available from cash flow, borrowings, additional capital raised privately or publicly, or seller retained financing.

Our primary use of funds will be for future acquisitions, public company expenses including regular distributions to our shareholders, investments in future acquisitions, payments to our manager pursuant to the management services agreement, potential payment of profit allocation to our manager and potential put price to our manager in respect of the allocation shares it owns. The management fee, expenses, potential profit allocation and potential put price are paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds we hold, which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures. See Item 1. “Business—Our Manager” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information concerning the management fee, the profit allocation and put price.

 

The amount of management fee paid to our manager by us is reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of our businesses. As a result, the management fee paid to our manager may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The amount of management fee paid to our manager may represent a significant cash obligation. In this respect, the payment of the management fee will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.

 

Our manager, as holder of 100% of our allocation shares, is entitled to receive a twenty percent (20%) profit allocation as a form of preferred equity distribution, subject to an annual hurdle rate of eight percent (8%), as follows. Upon the sale of a subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high-water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition by us exceeds the 8% hurdle rate. The 8% hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2% rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii) the number of quarters such subsidiary was held by us, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary’s average share (determined based on gross assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined based solely on the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition). The amount of profit allocation may represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of profit allocation paid, when paid, will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions. See Item 1. “Business—Our Manager—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Manager’s Profit Allocation” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the calculation of the profit allocation.

 

The last occurrence of profit allocation distribution to the Manager by the Company was during the fourth quarter of 2020, concurrent with the spin-off of a former subsidiary. Following the profit allocation distribution to the Manager, the board of directors identified a need to adjust the distribution to the Manger, which resulted in the recognition of a $2 million distribution receivable from the Manager within shareholders’ equity, with repayment anticipated upon the occurrence of the next qualified profit allocation distribution event (the “Distribution Receivable”).

 

On April 23, 2024, the Company and the Manager entered into a letter agreement regarding the timing of payment of the Distribution Receivable, pursuant to which the parties agreed to treat the Distribution Receivable as a $2,000,000, plus interest accrued thereon at a non-compounding rate equal to the applicable federal rate, unqualified obligation of the Manager to be repaid as a credit against all future profit allocations resulting from both a Sale Event and a Holding Event payable to the Manager, all until the Distribution Receivable is fully paid, provided that, if the Distribution Receivable is not fully paid by the application of such credit or otherwise by the first to occur of (i) December 31, 2024 and (ii) the date of the sale of all or substantially all the assets (in a transaction of any form) or the liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of either party, then upon such date the unpaid balance shall be immediately due, payable and paid by the Manager.

 

Our operating agreement also contains a supplemental put provision, which gives our manager the right, subject to certain conditions, to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. The amount of put price under the supplemental put provision is determined by assuming all of our subsidiaries are sold at that time for their fair market value and then calculating the amount of profit allocation would be payable in such a case. If the management services agreement is terminated for any reason other than our manager’s resignation, the payment to our manager could be as much as twice the amount of such hypothetical profit allocation. As is the case with profit allocation, the calculation of the put price is complex and based on many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. See Item 1. “Business—Our Manager—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Supplemental Put Provision” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the calculation of the put price. The put price obligation, if our manager exercises its put right, will represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of put price will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions.

 

Summary of Cash Flow

 

The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flows from continuing operations for the periods indicated:

Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $3,734,330 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in the net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of the cash paid for the acquisition of ICU Eyewear during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The decrease in the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of decreased proceeds in private placements and revolving loan, offset from increased proceeds from public offerings.

 

Public Offering

 

On February 9, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers and a placement agency agreement with Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, or Spartan, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to such purchasers an aggregate of 1,825,937 common shares and prefunded warrants for the purchase of 3,174,063 common shares at an offering price of $1.00 per common share and $0.99 per prefunded warrant, pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-276670). On February 14, 2024, the closing of this offering was completed. At the closing, the purchasers prepaid the exercise price of the prefunded warrants in full. Therefore, we received total gross proceeds of $5,000,000. Pursuant to the placement agency agreement, Spartan received a cash transaction fee equal to 8% of the aggregate gross proceeds and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. After deducting these and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $4,335,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 505,000 common shares upon the exercise of prefunded warrants.

Contractual Obligations

 

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under the loans described above and other contractual commitments described below.

 

We have engaged our manager to manage our day-to-day operations and affairs. Our relationship with our manager will be governed principally by the following agreements:

 

     ●    the management services agreement and offsetting management services agreements relating to the management services our

           manager will perform for us and the businesses we own and the management fee to be paid to our manager in respect thereof;

           and

 

     ●    our operating agreement setting forth our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares it owns, including the right

           to receive profit allocations from us, and the supplemental put provision relating to our manager’s right to cause us to

           purchase the allocation shares it

           owns.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates are based on management’s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

For a description of the accounting policies that, in management’s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

 

Not applicable.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, believes the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.

 

During its evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, our management identified the following material weaknesses:

 

     ●    we do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures, including written policies and

           procedures to ensure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements

           of GAAP and SEC disclosure

           requirements;

 

     ●    we failed to maintain a sufficient complement of personnel in our accounting and reporting department to ensure adequate

           segregation of duties such that appropriate review and monitoring of its financial records are executed;

           and

 

     ●    we did not design and maintain effective internal controls related to our information technology general controls in the

           areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support our financial

           reporting

           processes.

 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and in the first quarter of 2024, we continued to implement the following remedial procedures:

 

     ●    increasing personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function;

 

     ●    until we have sufficient technical accounting resources, we have engaged external consultants to provide support and to

           assist us in our evaluation of more complex applications of

           GAAP;

 

     ●    engaging internal control consultants to assist us in performing a financial reporting risk assessment as well as identifying

           and designing our system of internal controls necessary to mitigate the risks identified;

           and

 

     ●    preparation of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures.

 

We continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is appropriate assignment of authority, responsibility, and accountability to enable remediation of our material weaknesses. We believe that our remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. As we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary.

 

Other than in connection with the implementation of the remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
