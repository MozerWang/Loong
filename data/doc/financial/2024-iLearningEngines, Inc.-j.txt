NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

 

iLearningEngines, Inc. formerly known as Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on November 5, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).

 

The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through March 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination, including activities in connection with the Business Combination (as defined and discussed below). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the cash held in the Trust Account (as defined below).

 

Financing

 

The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on March 1, 2021. On March 4, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $287,500,000.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,250,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Arrowroot Acquisition LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $8,250,000.

 

Transaction costs amounted to $16,392,714, consisting of $5,750,000 in cash underwriting fees, net of reimbursements, $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees and $580,214 of other offering costs.

 

Trust Account

 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on March 4, 2021, an amount of $287,500,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and has been invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.

Operations Prior to Business Combination with iLearningEngines Holdings Inc.

 

On February 28, 2023, the Company’s stockholders held a special meeting (the “Special Meeting”) and approved and adopted an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from March 4, 2023 (the “Original Termination Date”) to July 6, 2023 (the “Charter Extension Date”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis for up to seven times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) if requested by the Arrowroot Acquisition LLC (the “Sponsor”), and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until February 4, 2024 (each, an “Additional Charter Extension Date”) for a total of up to eleven months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of an initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension”, such extension deadline, the “Extension Date”, and such proposal, the “Extension Proposal”). In connection with the Extension, shareholders holding 24,304,187 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account at a redemption price of approximately $10.17 per share. As a result, following the Special Meeting, approximately $247,259,068 in cash was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders.

 

The Company approved an additional draw of an aggregate of $160,000 pursuant to the Third Promissory Note, which Extension Funds were deposited into the Company’s Trust Account for its public stockholders, on January 5, 2024. This deposit enables the Company to extend the date by which it must complete its initial business combination from January 6, 2024 to February 6, 2024 (the “Seventh Extension”). The Seventh Extension is the final of seven one-month extensions permitted under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and provides the Company with additional time to complete its initial business combination.

 

On January 8, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “Annual Meeting Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company failed to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within 12 months after its fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), the Company had 45 calendar days (or until February 22, 2024) to submit a plan to regain compliance and, if Nasdaq accepts the plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company up to 180 calendar days from its fiscal year end, or until June 28, 2024, to regain compliance. The Company submitted a plan to regain compliance on February 22, 2024. While the compliance plan was pending, the Company’s securities continued to trade on Nasdaq. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: ARRW) changed its name to “iLearningEngines, Inc.” and is listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol “AILE”.

 

On February 2, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Extension Special Meeting”) to approve an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, (the “Charter Amendment”), to extend the Termination Date from February 4, 2024 to March 6, 2024 (the “Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis up to five times by an additional one month each time after the Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date (the Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date, as further extended by the Company, the “Subsequent Extension Date”), by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until August 6, 2024, unless the closing of an initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Subsequent Extension Proposal”). The stockholders of the Company approved the Subsequent Extension Proposal at the Extension Special Meeting and on February 2, 2024, the Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.

 

On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Non-Redemption Agreement (the “Non-Redemption Agreement”) with a certain public stockholder of the Company (the “Public Stockholder”) eligible to redeem its shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at the Company’s Extension Special Meeting. Pursuant to the Non-Redemption Agreement, the Public Stockholder agreed not to request redemption of 410,456 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Non-Redeemed Shares”) in connection with the Extension Special Meeting. In consideration of the Public Stockholder entering into the Non-Redemption Agreement, immediately following the closing of Arrowroot’s initial business combination, the Sponsor agreed to forfeit 82,091 shares of Class B common stock (the “Class B Common Stock”), or 41,046 shares of Class B Common Stock in the event the initial business combination is consummated in February 2024, (“Forfeited Shares”). Pursuant to the terms of the Non-Redemption Agreement, Arrowroot agreed to issue to the Public Stockholder and the Public Stockholder agreed to acquire from Arrowroot, a number of newly-issued shares of common stock promptly following the consummation of Arrowroot’s initial business combination. As a result, the Company recorded $9.30 per share or $763,446 as an expense with a corresponding charge to additional paid-in capital to recognize the fair value of the shares transferred.

 

In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of 3,428,783 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.59 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $36,309,429. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in the Company’s Trust Account was approximately $10.77 million.

See the Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024, for additional information.

 

Liquidity and Going Concern

 

On December 29, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the “First Promissory Note”) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000. Upon issuance, $750,000 was drawn down on the note with an additional $200,000 drawn down on March 17, 2022. On April 21, 2022, the Company drew down the remaining $550,000 pursuant to the terms of the First Promissory Note. Following this drawdown, the full $1,500,000 available under the First Promissory Note was outstanding. There are no remaining funds available under the First Promissory Note for future drawdowns. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1,500,000 were outstanding under this First Promissory Note.

 

The First Promissory Note is subject to the Sponsor’s approval and does not bear interest. The principal balance of the note will be payable on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination or (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”). In the event the Company consummates its initial Business Combination, the Sponsor has the option on the Maturity Date to convert all or any portion of the principal outstanding under the First Promissory Note into that number of warrants (“Working Capital Warrants”) equal to the portion of the principal amount of the First Promissory Note being converted divided by $1.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number. The terms of the Working Capital Warrants, if any, would be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company at the time of its initial public offering, as described in the prospectus for the initial public offering dated March 1, 2021 and filed with the SEC, including the transfer restrictions applicable thereto. The First Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the First Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the First Promissory Note becoming immediately due and payable. 

 

On February 23, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 in favor of the Sponsor (the “Second Promissory Note”), which was funded in full by the Sponsor upon execution of the Second Promissory Note. The Second Promissory Note is not convertible into Working Capital Warrants or any other security pursuant to its terms. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $500,000 outstanding balance under this Second Promissory Note.

In connection with the approval by the Company’s stockholders of the Extension Date at the Special Meeting, the Sponsor issued to the Company an unsecured promissory note that matures upon the Company closing its initial Business Combination (the “Third Promissory Note”). Following the Extension Proposal being approved, the Sponsor funded $640,000 of the Third Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the Third Promissory Note, on each Additional Charter Extension Date, the Sponsor must fund the lesser of (a) $160,000 or (b) $0.04 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting for an aggregate deposit of up to the lesser of (x) $1,120,000 or (y) $0.28 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting (if all seven additional monthly extensions are exercised). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $480,000 and $1,600,000 outstanding balance under this Third Promissory Note, respectively. Additionally, on January 5, 2024, the Company drew down an additional $160,000 pursuant to the Third Promissory Note. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company will, at the option of the Sponsor, repay the amounts loaned under the Third Promissory Note or convert a portion or all of the amounts loaned under such promissory note into warrants, which warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination by the Subsequent Charter Extension Date, such promissory note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven.

 

On June 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Fourth Promissory Note” and together with the First Promissory Note, the Second Promissory Note and the Third Promissory Note, the “Promissory Notes”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000 to the Sponsor. The Fourth Promissory Note bears interest at 15% per annum and matures upon closing of the Company’s initial Business Combination.  In the event that the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination, the Fourth Promissory Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Fourth Promissory Note may be further drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon request by the Company subject to the Sponsor’s approval. The Fourth Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Fourth Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Fourth Promissory Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a $750,000 and $1,200,000 principal outstanding under this Fourth Promissory Note, respectively. An additional $50,000 was drawn on the Fourth Promissory Note on March 11, 2024.

 

Notwithstanding the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the Company and Legacy iLearningEngines agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, that if the Closing occurs, the Sponsor will have the option for the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes to be repaid in cash or convert into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share at the Closing; provided, however, that to the extent the Acquiror Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceed $30,000,000 then the Promissory Notes will be settled by the conversion of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes and (ii) the Excess Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $26,757 of cash held outside its Trust Account for use as working capital, $10,788,134 in cash held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and working capital deficit of $14,359,935. As of March 31, 2024, $215,214 of the deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company withdrew an aggregate amount of $40,050 to pay income and franchise taxes and $36,309,429 in connection with redemption. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company working capital loans, as defined below.

 

In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that as a result of the closing of the business combination, there are no conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as such the going concern has been alleviated.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Emerging Growth Company

 

The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

 

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. One of the more significant accounting estimates included in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements is the determination of the fair value of the warrant liabilities. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Cash and Investments Held in Trust Account

 

Prior to the Special Meeting, the Company’s portfolio of cash and investments held in Trust Account was comprised solely of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account were classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these investments are included in interest earned on cash and investments held in Trust Account in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. In connection with the Special Meeting, the Company liquidated its portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account and converted it into cash held in the Trust Account.

 

Offering Costs

 

Offering costs consisted of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet date that are directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs associated with warrant liabilities were expensed as incurred in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the Class A common stock issued were initially charged to temporary equity and then accreted to Class A common stock subject to possible redemption upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs amounted to $16,392,714, of which $760,022 was allocated to the warrant liabilities and charged to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption

 

The Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at redemption value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ deficit. The Company’s Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets is reconciled in the following table:

Warrant Liabilities

 

The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.

 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 28,750,000 Units, including a full exercise by the underwriter of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). The Public Warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Private Placement Warrants are valued using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrant price was used as the fair value of the Public Warrants as of each relevant date (see Note 9).

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the unaudited condensed financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s deferred tax asset had a full valuation allowance recorded against it.

   

ASC 740-270-25-2 requires that an annual effective tax rate be determined, and such annual effective rate applied to year-to-date income in interim periods under ASC 740-270-30-5. The Company’s effective tax rate was 1.17% and (562.16%) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, due to changes in fair value in warrant liability, the fair value in convertible promissory notes and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.

 

ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.

 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.

 

The Company has identified the United States as its only “major” tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

 

Net Loss per Common Share

 

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. The Company has two classes of common stock, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of common stock. Net income per common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from loss per common share as the redemption value approximates fair value.

 

The Company has not considered the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 22,625,000 shares of Class A common stock in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for the periods presented.

 

The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share (in dollars, except per share amounts):

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

The Company has significant cash balances at financial institutions which throughout the year regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature, other than the warrant liabilities (see Note 9).

 

Recent Accounting Standards

 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)” (“ASU 2020-06”), to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company has adopted ASU 2020-06. The adoption of ASU-2020-06 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

 

Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 28,750,000 Units, including a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one Public Warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 8).

 

NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,250,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $8,250,000 in the aggregate. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 8). A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company did not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account would be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Placement Warrants would expire worthless.

NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

Founder Shares

 

In November 2020, the Sponsor purchased 5,750,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s Class B common stock for an aggregate price of $30,000. Subsequently, in December 2020 the Company effectuated a 5-for-4 stock split, pursuant to which an additional 1,437,500 shares of Class B common stock were issued, resulting in an aggregate of 7,187,500 Founder Shares issued and outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 937,500 Founder Shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the number of Founder Shares would equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock after the Initial Public Offering. In January 2021, the Sponsor transferred 40,000 founder shares to each of three Director nominees, none of which are subject to forfeiture in the event that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full. As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option March 4, 2021, no Founder Shares are currently subject to forfeiture.

 

The transfer of the Founders Shares to the Company’s director nominees is in the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The Founder Shares were effectively transferred subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon consummation of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of Founders Shares times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified).

 

The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Public Stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.

 

Administrative Support Agreement

 

The Company entered into an agreement, commencing on March 4, 2021, through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred $60,000 in fees for these services. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company incurred and paid $60,000 in fees for these services. There were $60,000 and $0 of fees outstanding for these services as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Promissory Notes — Related Parties

 

On December 21, 2020, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the “IPO Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The IPO Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) July 31, 2021, or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding balance under the IPO Promissory Note of $149,992 was repaid at the closing of the Initial Public Offering on March 4, 2021. No future borrowings are permitted.

 

Related Party Loans

 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Upon completion of the Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination had not closed, the Company could use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.

The Company has determined that bifurcation of a single derivative that comprises all of the fair value of the conversion feature (i.e., derivative instrument) is necessary under ASC 815-15-25-7 through 25-10. As a result, the derivative value was deemed to be de minimis at the issuance date and at each subsequent reporting date resulting in no change in the value of the derivative. The derivative will continue to be monitored and measured at each reporting period until the notes are settled.

 

On December 29, 2021, the Company issued its First Promissory Note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000. The note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor may make in the future, to the Company for working capital expenses. Upon issuance, $750,000 was drawn down on the note with an additional $200,000 drawn down on March 17, 2022. On April 21, 2022, the Company drew down the remaining $550,000 pursuant to the terms of the First Promissory Note. Following this drawdown, the full $1,500,000 available under the First Promissory Note was outstanding. There are no remaining funds available under the First Promissory Note for future drawdowns.

 

On February 23, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 in favor of the Sponsor (the “Second Promissory Note”), which was funded in full by the Sponsor upon execution of the Second Promissory Note. The Second Promissory Note is not convertible into Working Capital Warrants or any other security pursuant to its terms. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $500,000 outstanding balance under this Second Promissory Note, respectively.

 

In connection with the approval by the Company’s stockholders of the Extension Date at the Special Meeting, the Sponsor issued to the Company an unsecured promissory note that matures upon the Company closing its initial Business Combination (the “Third Promissory Note”). Following the Extension Proposal being approved, the Sponsor funded $640,000 of the Third Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the Third Promissory Note, on each Additional Charter Extension Date, the Sponsor must fund the lesser of (a) $160,000 or (b) $0.04 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting for an aggregate deposit of up to the lesser of (x) $1,120,000 or (y) $0.28 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting (if all seven additional monthly extensions are exercised). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a $1,600,000 outstanding balance under this Third Promissory Note. Additionally, on January 5, 2024, the Company drew down an additional $160,000 pursuant to the Third Promissory Note. Upon completion of the Business Combination, the Company would, at the option of the Sponsor, repay the amounts loaned under the Third Promissory Note or convert a portion or all of the amounts loaned under such promissory note into warrants, which warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. If the Company had not completed an initial Business Combination by the Subsequent Charter Extension Date, such promissory note would be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven.

 

On June 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $2,000,000 in favor of the Sponsor (the “Fourth Promissory Note” and together with the First Promissory Note, the Second Promissory Note and the Third Promissory Note, the “Promissory Notes”), of which $700,000 was funded by the Sponsor upon execution of the Note. On September 27, 2023, the Company drew down an additional amount of $500,000 pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Promissory Note, after which $1,200,000 was outstanding under the Note. An additional $50,000 was drawn on the Fourth Promissory Note on March 11, 2024. There remains $750,000 available under the Note for future drawdowns. The Fourth Promissory Note bears interest at 15% per annum and matures upon closing of the Company’s initial business combination or the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”). The Fourth Promissory Note is not convertible into Working Capital Warrants or any other security. In the event that the Company had not consummated an initial business combination, the Fourth Promissory Note would be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Fourth Promissory Note may be further drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon request by the Company subject to the Sponsor’s approval. The Fourth Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Fourth Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Fourth Promissory Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a $480,000 and $1,200,000 outstanding balance under this Fourth Promissory Note. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $33,736 and $89,408 of interest expense, respectively, which is included in Accrued Expenses on the balance sheet. An additional $50,000 was drawn on the Fourth Promissory Note on March 11, 2024.

 

Notwithstanding the original terms the Promissory Notes, the Company and Legacy iLearningEngines agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, that if the Closing occurs, the Sponsor will have the option for the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes to be repaid in cash or convert into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share at the Closing; provided, however, that to the extent the Acquiror Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceed $30,000,000, then the Promissory Notes will be settled by the conversion of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes and (ii) the Excess Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share.

 

The Board approved a draw of an aggregate of $160,000 (the “First Extension Funds”) pursuant to the Third Promissory Note, between the Company and Arrowroot Acquisition LLC (the “Lender”), which First Extension Funds were deposited into the Company’s Trust Account on July 6, 2023. This deposit enabled the Company to extend the date by which it must complete its initial business combination from July 6, 2023 to August 6, 2023 (the “First Extension”). The First Extension was the first of seven one-month extensions permitted under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and provides the Company with additional time to complete its initial business combination.

Forward Purchase Agreement

 

On April 26, 2023, the Company and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Polar”) entered into an agreement (“Forward Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares from Polar at $10.77 per share (the “Initial Price”), which is $10.17 (the “Redemption Price”, plus $0.60). In exchange for the Company’s purchase of the shares, Polar agreed to waive redemption rights on the shares that Polar owns in connection with the Business Combination.

 

The Forward Purchase Agreement provides that at the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will pre-pay Polar for the forward purchase an amount equal to the sum of (x) the number of Class A Ordinary Shares owned by Polar on the day prior to the closing of a business combination multiplied by the Redemption Price (the “Polar Shares”) and (y) the proceeds from Polar’s purchase of a number of Class A Ordinary Shares of up to 2,500,000 shares less the Polar Shares (the “Prepayment Amount”).

 

The scheduled maturity date of the forward transaction is one year from the closing of the Business Combination (the “Maturity Date”), except that the Maturity Date may be accelerated if the shares trade under $2.00 for 10 out of 30 days or the shares are delisted by Nasdaq. Polar has the right to early terminate the transaction (in whole or in part) before the Maturity Date by delivering notice to the Company. If Polar terminates the Forward Purchase Agreement with respect to some or all of the shares prior to the Maturity Date, Polar will return an amount to the Company equal to the number of terminated shares multiplied by the Redemption Price. The Company can terminate the Forward Purchase Agreement prior to the redemption deadline if the Company pays Polar a $300,000 break-up fee. On the Maturity Date, the Company may be required to make a cash payment to Polar if Polar has not terminated the Forward Purchase Agreement in full equal to the number of shares (less any shares terminated prior to the Maturity Date) multiplied by $0.60.

 

Upon closing of the Business Combination, the Company agreed to pay $246,000 and shares of iLearningEngines have been issued as repayment for the Forward Purchase Agreement.

 

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Risks and Uncertainties

 

Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Although a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and are in the process of being deployed in certain countries, including the United States, the timing for widespread vaccination is uncertain, and these vaccines may be less effective against new mutated strains of the virus. The impact of this coronavirus continues to evolve and is affecting the economies of many nations, individual companies and markets in general and may continue to last for an extended period of time. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The specific impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.

 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination.

Registration Rights

 

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on March 4, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggyback” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidated damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the Company’s securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

 

Underwriting Agreement

 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $10,062,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

 

On March 27, 2024, the Company signed a fee reduction agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald in which the underwriters forfeited 40.37% of the deferred underwriting commissions resulting in a reduction of $4,062,500 with a remaining $6,000,000 that is deferred and payable upon the business combination. The reduction of the $4,062,500 resulted in a gain from forgiveness of deferred underwriting commissions of $184,844 recorded as reduction of underwriting fee payable on the income statement and $3,877,656 was recorded to accumulated deficit.

           (iii) the aggregate exercise price of the Company Warrants (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that are issued and

           outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of Note Balance (as defined in the

           Company Convertible Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) divided by (y) $10.00. The “Base Purchase Price” means an

           amount equal to $1,285,000,000. The “Company Incentive Amount” means (x) the number of shares of the Company Class A Common

           Stock issuable to Legacy iLearningEngines securityholders (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the holders of Company

           Convertible Notes) at the Closing which Legacy iLearningEngines and the Company agree, at least two (2) business days prior

           to the Closing, to issue to certain private placement investors and non-redeeming stockholders (which amount will equal

           82.03125% of all such shares issued to such investors and non-redeeming stockholders, with the remainder being contributed

           by the Sponsor), multiplied by (y)

The Board has (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by the stockholders of the Company.

Sponsor Support Agreement

 

On April 27, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and Legacy iLearningEngines entered into an agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, in connection with the Closing, the Sponsor agreed to (i) vote all its shares of the Company common stock in favor of the Business Combination, (ii) discharge any Excess Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) by payment in cash or elect, at the option of Sponsor, to have the Company discharge any Excess Transaction Expenses by payment in cash against a corresponding cancellation of shares of the Company common stock held by Sponsor (or any combination thereof), (iii) loan all amounts contemplated by the proxy statement filed by the Company on or about February 13, 2023, pursuant to which the Company stockholders approved the extension of the deadline by which the Company must complete its Business Combination to July 6, 2023, including any amounts required in connection with any additional extension of such deadline, (iv) contribute the Sponsor Incentive Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (v) waive any adjustment to the conversion ratio set forth in the governing documents of the Company or any other anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to the Class B common stock of the Company, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement, and (vi) agree to be bound by any restrictions on transfer set forth in the Company’s bylaws, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion, including the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.

 

NOTE 8. WARRANT LIABILITIES

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 14,375,000 Public Warrants outstanding. Only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the initial public offering and will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or the Company’s liquidation.

 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elect, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the warrants for redemption for cash:

 

     ●    in whole and not in part;

           

     ●    at a price of $0.01 per warrant;

           

     ●    upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and

           

     ●    if, and only if, the closing price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted stock splits, stock

           capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period

           commencing after the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends to the notice of

           redemption to the warrant

           holders.

 

If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company for cash, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.

 

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.

 

In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day after the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 8,250,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

 

The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:

 

     Level 1:  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a

                market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing

                information on an ongoing

                basis.

 

     Level 2:  Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for

                similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not

                active.

 

     Level 3:  Unobservable inputs based on assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or

                liability.

 

As of March 31, 2024, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $10,788,134 in cash. As of December 31, 2023, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $46,744,889 in cash. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company withdrew an amount of $40,050 in interest income from the Trust Account to pay franchise and income taxes and $36,309,429 in connection with redemptions.

 

The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:

  

Description                                                                               Level         March 31,      December 31,  

                                                                                                           2024            2023

Cash and investments held in Trust Account                                                   1        $   10,788,134  $   46,744,889 

                                                                                                                                     

Liabilities:                                                                                                                         

Warrant Liabilities – Public Warrants                                                        1        $    2,587,500  $    1,150,000 

Warrant Liabilities – Private Placement Warrants                                             3        $    1,485,000  $      660,000 

Forward Purchase Agreement                                                                   3        $    1,500,000  $    1,500,000 

 

The Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 

The Private Placement Warrants are valued using a modified Black Scholes Option Pricing Model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The modified Black Scholes model’s primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is the expected volatility of the common stock. The expected volatility as of the initial public offering date was derived from observable public warrant pricing on comparable ‘blank-check’ companies without an identified target. The expected volatility as of subsequent valuation dates was implied from the Company’s own Public Warrant pricing. A Monte Carlo simulation methodology was used in estimating the fair value of the public warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available, using the same expected volatility as was used in measuring the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants.  For periods subsequent to the detachment of the warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrants was used as the fair value of the Public Warrants as of each relevant date. The measurement of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units is classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market.

On April 16, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), as contemplated in the Merger Agreement the Company consummated the merger transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, following the approval by Arrowroot’s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on April 1, 2024 (the “ARRW Stockholder Meeting”), whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy iLearningEngines with the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceasing (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”).

 

The Business Combination is being accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, although the Company issued shares for outstanding equity interests of Legacy iLearningEngines in the business combination, Arrowroot is treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of the Company issuing stock for the net assets of Arrowroot, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Arrowroot is stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the business combination will be those of the Company.

 

In connection with the closing of the business combination, Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: ARRW) changed its name to “iLearningEngines, Inc.” and is listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol “AILE”.

 

As a result of the Merger and upon the Closing, among other things, (1) each share of Legacy iLearningEngines Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing was exchanged for the right to receive the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New iLearningEngines equal to the exchange ratio of 0.8061480 (the “Exchange Ratio”) for an aggregate of 77,242,379 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock; (2) each share of Legacy iLearningEngines Common Stock held in the treasury of Legacy iLearningEngines was cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution was or will be made with respect thereto; (3) each Vested RSU was cancelled and converted into the right to receive, subject to settlement and delivery in accordance with the Legacy iLearningEngines equity incentive plan, a number of New iLearningEngines Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, for an aggregate of 5,675,890 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock; (4) each Unvested RSU was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a number of restricted stock units issued by the New iLearningEngines equal to the Exchange Ratio (“New iLearningEngines Converted RSU Award”), with each New iLearningEngines Converted RSU Award subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the original Legacy iLearningEngines restricted stock unit award, for an aggregate of 78,730 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock subject to New iLearningEngines RSU Awards; (5) each share of vested Legacy iLearningEngines restricted stock was converted into the right to receive a number of shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, for an aggregate of 290,447 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock; (6) each share of unvested Legacy iLearningEngines restricted stock was converted into the right to receive a number of restricted shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock (“New iLearningEngines Converted Restricted Stock”) equal to the Exchange Ratio, with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such unvested Legacy iLearningEngines restricted stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shares will be restricted subject to vesting on the books and records of Legacy iLearningEngines, for an aggregate of 32,151,912 shares of New iLearningEngines Converted Restricted Stock; and (7) each Convertible Note (as defined below) was converted into the right to receive a number of shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock equal to the Note Balance (as defined in the Convertible Notes), divided by $10.00, for an aggregate of 13,060,608 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock.

 

In connection with the ARRW Stockholder Meeting (and related postponements) and the Business Combination, the holders of an aggregate of 460,114 shares of Arrowroot’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.36 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $4.8 million. Upon the Closing, the Company received approximately $52.7 million in gross proceeds, comprising approximately $5.9 million from the Arrowroot trust account, approximately $17.4 million from the 2023 Convertible Notes (as defined below) and approximately $29.4 million from the 2024 Convertible Notes (as defined below).

In addition, at the Closing, Arrowroot instructed its transfer agent to separate its public units into their component securities, and, as a result, Arrowroot’s public units no longer trade as a separate security and were delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).

 

After giving effect to the Business Combination and the conversion of each Convertible Note, there (i) were 134,970,114 issued and outstanding shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock, consisting of the following: (a) 77,242,379 shares issued to holders of Legacy iLearningEngines common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time; (b) 32,442,359 shares issued to holders of Legacy iLearningEngines restricted stock awards immediately prior to the Effective Time; (c) 13,060,608 shares issued to the holders of convertible notes immediately prior to the Effective Time; (d) 556,886 shares held by former Arrowroot Class A Common Stockholders; (e) 6,705,409 shares held by former Arrowroot Class B Common Stockholders; (f) an aggregate of 4,419,998 shares issued to Venture Lending & Leasing IX, Inc. (“Venture Lending”) and WTI Fund X, Inc. (“WTI Fund X” and together with Venture Lending, the “Lenders”) pursuant to the Second Omnibus Amendment to Loan Documents with In2vate, L.L.C. and the Lenders; (g) an aggregate of 82,091 shares issued to certain investors pursuant to a non-redemption agreement with certain investors; and (h) an aggregate of 460,384 shares issued to the Sponsor; and (ii) warrants to purchase 22,624,975 shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock, consisting of 14,374,975 public warrants, each exercisable for one share of New iLearningEngines Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, and 8,250,000 private warrants, each exercisable for one share of New iLearningEngines Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

 

The Company negotiated concessions on accounts payable to other third-party vendors in several forms. The form of concessions include: (1) providing a discount to the total amount payable, (2) the option to settle certain payables in common stock, and (3) entering into a deferred payment agreement for certain payables. The concessions became effective on the Closing Date.

 

2023 Convertible Notes

 

Prior to the Closing, on April 27, 2023, Legacy iLearningEngines entered into a convertible note purchase agreement (the “2023 Convertible Note Purchase Agreement”), with certain investors (collectively, with all investors who may become party to the 2023 Convertible Note Purchase Agreement thereafter, the “2023 Convertible Note Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, Legacy iLearningEngines issued and sold to the 2023 Convertible Note Investors convertible notes due in October 2025 (“2023 Convertible Notes”) with aggregate principal amount of $17,400,000, including to affiliates of the Sponsor. Each 2023 Convertible Note accrued interest at a rate of (i) 15% per annum until the aggregate accrued interest thereunder equals 25% of the principal amount of such note, and (ii) 8% per annum thereafter. Immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, each 2023 Convertible Note automatically converted into 4,971,076 shares of Legacy iLearningEngines thereby entitling the holder thereof to receive, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, a number of shares New iLearningEngines Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) 2.75, multiplied by the outstanding principal under such 2023 Convertible Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, divided by (ii) $10.00. A description of the 2023 Convertible Notes is included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in the section entitled “Certain Arrowroot Relationships and Related Party Transactions  —  Promissory Notes” beginning on page 261 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, each 2024 Convertible Note automatically converted into shares of Legacy iLearningEngines thereby entitling the holder thereof to receive, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, a number of shares New iLearningEngines Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) 2.75, multiplied by the outstanding principal under such Convertible Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, divided by (ii) $10.00. The price per share at which the Principal (as defined in the 2024 Convertible Notes), together with accrued but unpaid interest, on each 2024 Convertible Note converts into Incentive Shares (as defined in the 2024 Convertible Note Purchase Agreement) is referred to as the “Conversion Price” herein.

 

Revolving Loan Agreement

 

On April 17, 2024 (the “Loan Closing Date”), Legacy iLearningEngines entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Revolving Loan Agreement”), by and among Legacy iLearningEngines as borrower (“Borrower”), the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and East West Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders (“Agent”). The Revolving Loan Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million and (ii) an uncommitted accordion facility allowing the Borrower to increase the revolving commitments by an additional principal amount of $20.0 at Borrower’s option and upon Agent’s approval (collectively, the “Revolving Loans”). Borrower drew $40.0 million in Revolving Loans on the Loan Closing Date, which was used (x) to repay in full Borrower’s existing indebtedness under the (i) Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 30, 2020, between Legacy iLearningEngines and Venture Lending & Leasing IX, Inc., (ii) Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of October 21, 2021, between Legacy iLearningEngines, and Venture Lending & Leasing IX, Inc. and WTI Fund X, Inc. and (iii) Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2023, between Legacy iLearningEngines and WTI Fund X, Inc. (the “WTI Loan Agreements”) and which will be used for (y) for general corporate purposes.

 

The obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement are secured by a perfected security interest in substantially all of the Borrower’s assets except for certain customary excluded property pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Loan Agreement. On the Loan Closing Date, the Company and In2Vate, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company (the “Guarantors”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy iLearningEngines entered into a Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement (the “Guaranty”) with the Agent, pursuant to which the Guarantors provided a guaranty of Borrower’s obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement and provided a security interest in substantially all of the Guarantors’ assets except for certain customary excluded property pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty.

Overview

 

We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses

 

On February 28, 2023, the Company’s stockholders held a special meeting (the “Special Meeting”) where the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination (as described in Note 1) was extended from March 4, 2023 to the Extension Date (as defined below). In connection with the extension vote, 24,304,187 Class A common stock were redeemed for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $247,259,068. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account (the “Trust Account”) was $45,229,556. The balance in the Trust Account as of March 31, 2024 was $10,788,134. 

 

On February 2, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Extension Special Meeting”) to approve an amendment to Arrowroot’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, (the “Charter Amendment”) to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) from February 4, 2024 to March 6, 2024 (the “Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis up to five times by an additional one month each time after the Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date (the Initial Subsequent Charter Extension Date, as further extended by Arrowroot, the “Subsequent Extension Date”), by resolution of the Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until August 6, 2024, unless the closing of an initial business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Subsequent Extension Proposal”). The stockholders of the Company approved the Subsequent Extension Proposal at the Extension Special Meeting and on February 2, 2024, the Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.

  

On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Non-Redemption Agreement (the “Non-Redemption Agreement”) with a certain public stockholder of the Company (the “Public Stockholder”) eligible to redeem its shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at the Company’s Extension Special Meeting. Pursuant to the Non-Redemption Agreement, the Public Stockholder agreed not to request redemption of 410,456 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Non-Redeemed Shares”) in connection with the Extension Special Meeting. In consideration of the Public Stockholder entering into the Non-Redemption Agreement, immediately following the closing of Arrowroot’s initial business combination, the Sponsor agreed to forfeit 82,091 shares of Class B common stock (the “Class B Common Stock”), or 41,046 shares of Class B Common Stock in the event the initial business combination is consummated in February 2024, (“Forfeited Shares”). Pursuant to the terms of the Non-Redemption Agreement, Arrowroot agreed to issue to the Public Stockholder and the Public Stockholder agreed to acquire from Arrowroot, a number of newly-issued shares of common stock promptly following the consummation of Arrowroot’s initial business combination.

 

In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of 3,428,783 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.59 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $36,309,429. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $10.77 million.

 

As described in greater detail in Note 1 - Description of Organization and Business Operations to the notes to the financial statements included herein, on April 27, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with ARAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and iLearningEngines Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy iLearningEngines”) (the “Business Combination”).

 

As described in greater detail in Note 5 – Related Party Transactions, on April 26, 2023, the Company and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Polar”) entered into an agreement (“Forward Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares from Polar at $10.77 per share (the “Initial Price”), which is $10.17 (the “Redemption Price”, plus $0.60). In exchange for the Company’s purchase of the shares, Polar agreed to waive redemption rights on the shares that Polar owns in connection with the Business Combination.

28

 

 

The Forward Purchase Agreement provides that at the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will pre-pay Polar for the forward purchase an amount equal to sum of (x) the number of Class A Ordinary Shares owned by Polar on the day prior to the closing of a business combination multiplied by the Redemption Price (the “Polar Shares”) and (y) the proceeds from Polar’s purchase of a number of Class A Ordinary Shares of up to 2,500,000 shares less the Polar Shares (the “Prepayment Amount”).

 

The scheduled maturity date of the forward transaction is one year from the closing of the Business Combination (the “Maturity Date”), except that the Maturity Date may be accelerated if the shares trade under $2.00 for 10 out of 30 days or the shares are delisted by Nasdaq. Polar has the right to early terminate the transaction (in whole or in part) before the Maturity Date by delivering notice to the Company. If Polar terminates the Forward Purchase Agreement with respect to some or all of the shares prior to the Maturity Date, Polar will return an amount to the Company equal to the number of terminated shares multiplied by the Redemption Price. The Company can terminate the Forward Purchase Agreement prior to the redemption deadline if the Company pays Polar a $300,000 break-up fee. On the Maturity Date, the Company may be required to make a cash payment to Polar if Polar has not terminated the Forward Purchase Agreement in full equal to the number of shares (less any shares terminated prior to the Maturity Date) multiplied by $0.60.

 

Upon closing of the Business Combination, the Company agreed to pay $246,000 and shares of New iLearningEngines have been issued as repayment for the Forward Purchase Agreement.

 

Consummated Business Combination

 

On April 16, 2024, we consummated the previously announced Business Combination pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of April 27, 2023, by and among Arrowroot Acquisition Corp., ARAC Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and Legacy iLearningEngines. Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy iLearningEngines with the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceasing and Legacy iLearningEngines surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed its name to iLearningEngines, Inc. See the Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024, for additional information.

 

Unless specifically stated, this Quarterly Report does not give effect to the Business Combination and does not contain the risks associated with the Business Combination.

 

Results of Operations

 

The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through March 31, 2024, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for an initial business combination, including in connection with the Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had net loss of $4,236,183, which consists of loss of $2,262,500 derived from the changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities, general and administrative expenses of $1,545,279, expense for non-redemption consideration of $763,446, interest expense – promissory note of $33,736 and provision for income tax of $48,790, offset by interest income earned on cash and investments held in the Trust Account of $232,724, and reduction of deferred underwriting fee of $184,844.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net loss of $1,694,692, which consists of general and administrative costs of $828,626, provision for income taxes of $455,948 and loss of $2,610,000 derived from changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities, offset by interest income earned on investments held in the Trust Account of $2,199,882.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

On March 4, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 Units which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $287,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 8,250,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $8,250,000.

 

Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of $287,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $16,392,714 in transaction costs related to the Initial Public Offering, consisting of $5,750,000 in cash underwriting fees, $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees and $580,214 of other offering costs.

 

On February 28, 2023, the Company’s stockholders held the Special Meeting and approved and adopted an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from March 4, 2023 (the “Original Termination Date”) to July 6, 2023 (the “Charter Extension Date”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate an initial Business Combination on a monthly basis for up to seven times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until February 4, 2024 (each, an “Additional Charter Extension Date”) or a total of up to eleven months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of an initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension”, such extension deadline, the “Extension Date”, and such proposal, the “Extension Proposal”). In connection with the Extension, shareholders holding 24,304,187 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account at a redemption price of approximately $10.17 per share. As a result, following the Special Meeting, approximately $247,259,068 in cash was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $208,962. Net loss of $4,236,183 was affected by income related to the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $2,262,500, non-redemption consideration of $763,446, $184,844 of reduction of deferred underwriting fee, and interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of $232,724. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $1,418,843 of cash for operating activities.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $458,031. Net loss of $1,694,692 was affected by income related to the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of $2,610,000 and interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $2,199,882. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $826,543 of cash for operating activities.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of $10,788,134 (including $215,214 of interest). Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through March 31, 2024, we withdrew an amount of $40,050 interest earned from the Trust Account to pay franchise and income taxes and $36,309,429 in connection with redemption.

 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash of $26,757. If we do not complete the Business Combination, then we intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination (which we currently anticipate will be the Business Combination).

 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.

 

On December 21, 2020, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the “IPO Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The outstanding balance under the IPO Promissory Note of $149,992 was repaid at the closing of the initial public offering on March 4, 2021.

 

On December 29, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “First Promissory Note”) in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000 to its Sponsor, of which $750,000 was funded by the Sponsor upon execution of the First Promissory Note and an additional amount of $200,000 was drawn down on March 17, 2022. On April 21, 2022, the Company drew down the remaining $550,000 pursuant to the terms of the First Promissory Note issued on December 29, 2021. Following this drawdown, the full $1,500,000 available under the First Promissory Note was outstanding. There are no remaining funds available under the First Promissory Note for future drawdowns. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1,500,000 were outstanding under this First Promissory Note.

 

The First Promissory Note does not bear interest. The principal balance of the First Promissory Note will be payable on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination or (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”). In the event the Company consummates its initial Business Combination, the Sponsor has the option on the Maturity Date to convert all or any portion of the principal outstanding under the First Promissory Note into that number of warrants (“Working Capital Warrants”) equal to the portion of the principal amount of the First Promissory Note being converted divided by $1.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number. The terms of the Working Capital Warrants, if any, would be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company at the time of its initial public offering, as described in the prospectus for the initial public offering dated March 1, 2021 and filed with the SEC, including the transfer restrictions applicable thereto. The Promissory Notes are subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Promissory Notes and all other sums payable with regard to the Promissory Notes becoming immediately due and payable.

 

On February 23, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 in favor of the Sponsor (the “Second Promissory Note”), which was funded in full by the Sponsor upon execution of the Second Promissory Note. The Second Promissory Note is not convertible into Working Capital Warrants or any other security pursuant to its terms. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $500,000 outstanding balance under this Second Promissory Note.

In connection with the approval by the Company’s stockholders of the Extension Date at the Special Meeting, the Sponsor issued to the Company an unsecured promissory note that matures upon the Company closing its initial Business Combination (the “Third Promissory Note”). Following the Extension Proposal being approved, the Sponsor funded $640,000 of the Third Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the Third Promissory Note, on each Additional Charter Extension Date, the Sponsor must fund the lesser of (a) $160,000 or (b) $0.04 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting for an aggregate deposit of up to the lesser of (x) $1,120,000 or (y) $0.28 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the Special Meeting (if all seven additional monthly extensions are exercised). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $480,000 and $1,600,000 outstanding balance under this Third Promissory Note. Additionally, on January 5, 2024, the Company drew down an additional $160,000 pursuant to the Third Promissory Note. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company will, at the option of the Sponsor, repay the amounts loaned under the Third Promissory Note or convert a portion or all of the amounts loaned under such promissory note into warrants, which warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination by the Subsequent Charter Extension Date, such promissory note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven.

  

On June 13, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Fourth Promissory Note” and together with the First Promissory Note, the Second Promissory Note and the Third Promissory Note, the “Promissory Notes”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000 to the Sponsor. The Fourth Promissory Note bears interest at 15% per annum and matures upon closing of the Company’s initial Business Combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination, the Fourth Promissory Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Fourth Promissory Note may be further drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon request by the Company subject to the Sponsor’s approval. The Fourth Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Fourth Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Fourth Promissory Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $750,000 and $1,200,000 principal outstanding under this Fourth Promissory Note. An additional $50,000 was drawn on the Fourth Promissory Note on March 11, 2024.

 

All of the Company’s outstanding Promissory Notes are subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Promissory Notes and all other sums payable with regard to the promissory notes becoming immediately due and payable. However, notwithstanding the original terms the Promissory Notes, the Company and Legacy iLearningEngines agreed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, that if the Closing occurs, the Sponsor will have the option for the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes to be repaid in cash or convert into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share at the Closing; provided, however, that to the extent the Acquiror Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceed $30,000,000, then the Promissory Notes will be settled by the conversion of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the principal and interest outstanding under the Promissory Notes and (ii) the Excess Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share.

 

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement by and among Arrowroot Acquisition Corp., ARAC Merger Sub, Inc. and Legacy iLearningEngines, at closing Arrowroot Acquisition LLC elected to settle $500,000 of the Acquiror Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Agreement) in cash and convert the balance of the Acquiror Transaction Expenses into shares of common stock of New iLearningEngines.

 

Going Concern

 

In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that as a result of the closing of the Business Combination on April 16, 2024, there are no conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, as such the going concern has been alleviated.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

 

Contractual Obligations

 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of $20,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services. We began incurring these fees on March 4, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation.

 

On March 25, 2024, Goodwin Proctor LLP (“Goodwin”) and the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay $2,000,000 upon closing of the Business Combination and another $1,000,000 as a deferred payment before July 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued $2,718,385 and $1,907,277, respectively.

On October 20, 2020, Cooley LLP and Arrowroot entered into a letter agreement (the “Cooley Engagement Letter”) pursuant to which Arrowroot engaged Cooley as a law firm in connection with the Business Combination. On March 27, 2024, Cooley and Arrowroot amended the Cooley Engagement Letter (the “Cooley Amendment”), to provide that, Arrowroot will pay to Cooley $2,000,000 in legal fees (the “Cooley Deferred Law Fee”) in the form of a certain number of shares (the “Cooley Fee Shares”). The Cooley Fee Shares will be issued in the form of shares of New iLearningEngines Common Stock (as defined below) in an amount of shares equal to the greater of (i) $2,000,000, divided by $10.00 and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $2,000,000 by (y) the VWAP (as defined in the Cooley Amendment) of New iLearningEngines Common Stock over the seven (7) trading days immediately prior to the initial filing of the Resale Registration Statement (as defined in the Cooley Amendment). Under the Cooley Amendment, the combined company will be subject to, among others, certain obligations with respect to the filing of the resale registration statement and maintaining the continued effectiveness of the resale registration statement. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued $1,205,451 and $1,187,272, respectively.

 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $10,062,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

  

On March 27, 2024, the Company signed a fee reduction agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald in which the underwriters forfeited 40.37% of the deferred underwriting commissions resulting in a reduction of $4,062,500 with a remaining $6,000,000 that is deferred and payable upon the business combination. The reduction of the $4,062,500 resulted in a gain from forgiveness of deferred underwriting commissions of $184,844 recorded as reduction of underwriting fee payable on the income statement and $3,877,656 was recorded to accumulated deficit.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates:

 

Warrant Liabilities

 

We account for the Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 under which the Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, we classify the Warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statements of operations. The Private Warrants and the Public Warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available are valued using a modified Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the Public Warrant quoted market price was used as the fair value as of each relevant date.

 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

Not required for smaller reporting companies.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

None.

 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (our “Annual Report”). As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. This Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report and other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.

 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

 

On March 4, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $287,500,000. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as sole book-running of the Initial Public Offering. The securities in the offering were registered under the Securities Act on our registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-252997). The SEC declared the registration statements effective on March 1, 2021.

 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 8,250,000 Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $8,250,000. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

 

33

 

 

On December 29, 2021, we issued the First Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000 to our Sponsor, of which $750,000 was funded by the Sponsor upon execution of the First Promissory Note and additional amounts of $200,000 and $550,000 were drawn down on March 17, 2022 and April 21, 2022, respectively, after which $1,500,000 was outstanding under the First Promissory Note. As of March 31, 2023, no amounts remained available under the First Promissory Note for future drawdowns. The issuance of the First Promissory Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

 

The First Promissory Note is subject to the Sponsor’s approval and does not bear interest. The principal balance of the note will be payable on Maturity Date. Pursuant to the terms of the First Promissory Note, in the event the Company consummates its initial Business Combination, the Sponsor has the option on the Maturity Date to convert all or any portion of the principal outstanding under the First Promissory Note into that number of Working Capital Warrants. However, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we have agreed, that if the Closing occurs, the Sponsor will have the option for the principal and interest outstanding under the First Promissory Note to be repaid in cash or convert into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share at the Closing; provided, however, that to the extent the Acquiror Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceed $30,000,000, then the First Promissory Note will be settled by the conversion of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the principal and interest outstanding under the First Promissory Note and (ii) the Excess Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) into common stock of the Surviving Corporation at a price per share equal to $10.00 per share. The First Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the First Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Convertible Promissory Note becoming immediately due and payable.

 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described in Note 9 to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

 

Of the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate of $287,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account.

 

We paid a total of $5,750,000 in cash underwriting fees and $580,214 for other costs and expenses related to the Initial Public Offering and incurred $10,062,500 in deferred underwriting fees.

 

For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.
