Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 – GENERAL

 

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position and the results of its operations for the periods presented, in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

 

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s fiscal year end December 31, 2023 report. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024.

 

The summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.

 

Corporate History

 

We were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products. On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, or “CE HRS”, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.

 

Our principal executive offices are located at 1340 Reynolds Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CETY.”

 

Our internet website address is www.cetyinc.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document, and you should not consider any information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this document.

 

The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY Renewables waste to energy, and engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading.

 

                                                                   8

 

 

Going Concern

 

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $4,414,986 and a working capital of $324,893 as of March 31, 2024. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $24,473,587 as of March 31, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.

 

Plan of Operation

 

CETY is a rising leader in the zero-emission revolution by providing eco-friendly energy solutions, clean energy fuels, and alternative electric power for small to mid-sized projects across North America, Europe, and Asia.

We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts

 

NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 

The summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.

 

The consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves.

 

                                                                   9

 

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

We maintain the majority of our cash accounts at JP Morgan Chase bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000, (which we may exceed from time to time) per commercial bank. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Our ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts receivable of $95,000. Our policy for reserves for our long-term financing receivables is determined on a contract-by-contract basis and considers the length of the financing arrangement. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable long-term financing receivables of $247,500.

 

Eight customers accounted for approximately 98% of accounts receivable on March 31, 2024. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant.

 

Inventory

 

Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of March 31, 2024 we had a reserve of $934,344 as compared to a reserve of $934,344 as of December 31, 2023.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:

 SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

Furniture and fixtures                                                                                 3 to 5 years

 

                                                                   10

 

 

Long – Lived Assets

 

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

 

Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.

 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).

 

Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time

 

FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10

 

An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:

 

a. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).

b. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).

c. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).

 

                                                                   11

 

 

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time

 

FASB ASC 606-10-25-30

 

If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

a. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset

b. The customer has legal title to the asset

c. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset

d. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset

e. The customer has accepted the asset

 

The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)

 

The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:

 

     ●    Identify the contract with the customer

     ●    Identify the performance obligations in the contract

     ●    Determine the transaction price

     ●    Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

     ●    Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

 

The following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:

 

     ●    We generate a quotation

     ●    We receive Purchase orders from our customers.

     ●    We build the product to their specification

     ●    We invoice at the time of shipment

     ●    The terms are typically Net 30 days

 

The following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:

 

     ●    CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service. 

 

A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):

 

     a.   A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control

           before transfer to the customer may not

           qualify.

     b.   A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide

           the service to the customer on the entity’s

           behalf.

     c.   A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or

           service to the

           customer.

 

If the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.

 

                                                                   12

 

 

Additionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:

 

Because the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.

 

In recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.

 

     ●    The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the

           performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and

           commissioning.

 

     ●    CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting,

           design, procurement, construction, and

           commissioning.

 

     ●    CETY and customer agree to a total EPC contract price.

 

     ●    The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.

 

     ●    Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.

 

Secondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.

 

CETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.

 

CETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.

 

In review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.

 

In reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.

 

Finally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.

 

For CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.

 

During the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.

 

We have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.

 

Given the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.

 

Also, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31,2024 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.

 

Also from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of March 31,2024, and December 31, 2023 and, we had outstanding customer deposits of $119,121 and $165,236 respectively.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:

 

     ●    Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

     ●    Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices

           in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for

           substantially the full term of the related assets or

           liabilities.

     ●    Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of

           the assets or liabilities. The Company’s derivative liabilities have been valued as Level 3 instruments. We value the

           derivative liability using a lattice model, with a volatility of 56% and using a risk free interest rate of

           0.15%

 

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

 

Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)

 

We have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. The accounts of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB. The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of operations.

 

                                                                   13

 

 

The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.

 

Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation

 

In July 2022, JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHK owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022, JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya.

 

Shuya was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other two shareholders of Shuaya have large supply relationships.

 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya was not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50% of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly, it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor (“JHJ”) recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee (“Shuya”) in the periods when these profits and losses are also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement. Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment.

 

JHJ made a investment of RMB 3.91 million ($0.55 million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately $10,750 during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately $5,000 was allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount.

 

However, effective January 1, 2023, JHJ, SSEN and Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (“Xiangyueheng), who is the 10% shareholder of Shuya, entered a Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, wherein these three shareholders (or three parties) will guarantee that the voting rights will be expressed in the same way at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agree that within the validity period of this agreement, before the party intends to propose the motions to the shareholders or the board of directors on the major matters related to the voting rights of the shareholders or the board of directors, the three parties internally will discuss, negotiate and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.

 

As a result of Consistent Action Agreement, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya effective on January 1, 2023.

 

The change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition of the combined company’s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined company.

 

In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill. Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. 

 

As the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value of 51% non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.

Under ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest.

On January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.

Net (Loss) per Common Share

 

Basic (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. At March 31, 2024, we had outstanding common shares of 40,143,893. Basic Weighted average common shares and equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 were 42,550,948 and 37,255,674 respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had convertible notes, convertible into approximately 2,659,288 of additional common shares and outstanding warrants of 2,099,352 shares. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents were withheld from the calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 as they were considered anti-dilutive.

 

Research and Development

 

We had no amounts of research and development (R&D) expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.

 

Segment Disclosure

 

FASB Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise’s reportable segments. The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS), CETY Europe, CETY HK and engineering & manufacturing services division. The segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. Refer to note 1 for a description of the various product categories manufactured under each of these segments.

 

An operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.

Share-Based Compensation

 

The Company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility. For the “risk-free interest rate,” we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.

 

We re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. 

 

                                                                   16

 

 

Leases

 

The Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to be accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019, and accordingly, modified its policy on accounting for leases as stated below. As described under “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,” below, the primary impact of adopting ASC 842 for the Company was the recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of certain lease-related assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months.

 

The Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate since the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Leased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use asset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.

 

Income Taxes

 

Federal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception of Clean Energy Technologies.

 

On December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 using a Federal Tax Rate of 21% and an estimated state of California rate of 9%.

 

Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 Income Taxes – Recognition. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.

 

Deferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.

 

As of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(8,275,877) and a deferred tax asset of $2,482,763 using the statutory rate of 30%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked a valuation allowance of $(2,482,763). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On March 31, 2024 the Company did not take any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.

 

On February 13, 2018, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant” or “Corporation”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between MGW Investment I Limited (“MGWI”) and the Corporation. The Corporation received $907,388 in exchange for the issuance of 302,462,667 restricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”).

 

On February 13, 2018, the Corporation and Confections Ventures Limited. (“CVL”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,” together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Financing”) pursuant to which the Corporation issued to CVL a convertible promissory Note (the “CVL Note”) in the principal amount of $939,500 with an interest rate of 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 13, 2020. The CVL Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share, as adjusted as provided therein. This note was assigned to MGW Investments.

 

This resulted in a change in control, which limited the net operating to that date forward. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years’ subject to audit prior to December 31, 2015. The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.

                                                                   17

 

 

Reclassification

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 

Deferred Stock Issuance Costs

 

Deferred stock issuance costs represent amounts paid for legal, consulting, and other offering expenses in conjunction with the future raising of additional capital to be performed within one year. These costs are netted against additional paid-in capital as a cost of the stock issuance upon closing of the respective stock placement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024 no stock issuance costs were capitalized.

The note bears interest at the rate of 2.66% per annum. The note is payable on the following schedule: (a) $200,000 in principal on December 31, 2015 and (b) thereafter, the remaining principal amount of $1,200,000, together with interest thereon, payable in equal quarterly instalments of principal and interest of $157,609, commencing on December 31, 2016 and continuing until December 31, 2019, at which time the remaining unpaid principal amount of this note and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full. CETY stopped making payments and informed GE that it had encountered difficulties because of the valuations of the assets that were acquired from GE. Given that the values of the assets were different than GE’s internal reports and as we discussed at the time of the transaction with GE’s management, we proposed a change in the amount the Company owes GE under the purchase agreement, but GE was non-responsive, and GE’s entire distributed power vertical has been divested.

NOTE 11 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Operating Rental Leases

 

ASB ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” – In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted the above ASU as of January 1, 2019. The right of use asset and lease liability have been recorded at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, utilizing a 5% average borrowing rate and the company is utilizing the transition relief and “running off” on current leases.

 

As of May 1, 2017, our corporate headquarters were located at 2990 Redhill Unit A, Costa Mesa, CA. On March 10, 2017, the Company signed a lease agreement for an 18,200-square foot CTU Industrial Building. Lease term is seven years and two months beginning July 1, 2017. This lease ended as of November 30, 2023. In October of 2018 we signed a sublease agreement with our facility in Italy with an indefinite term that may be terminated by either party with a 60-day notice for 1,000 Euro per month. Due to the short termination clause, we are treating this as a month-to-month lease. This lease ended as of December 31, 2023.

 

We have relocated our corporate office to 1340 Reynolds Avenue Unit 120, Irvine, CA 92614. On December 1, 2023, the Company signed a lease agreement for a 3000-square foot of office space with Metro Creekside California, LLC. Lease term is thirty-eight months beginning December 1, 2023 and expiring on January 31, 2027. On October 16 of 2023, we signed a sublease agreement to relocate the HRS operations from Costa Mesa to Irvine, California for one year and 7 months commencing December 1, 2023 and ending June 30, 2025. We also signed a temporary storage lease and Due to the short termination clause, we are treating this as a month-to-month lease.

 

                                                                   26

The lease required a security deposit of RMB 77,120 (or $10,727).

Each share of our common stock has identical rights and privileges in every respect. The holders of our common stock are entitled to vote upon all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. There are no cumulative voting rights.

 

                                                                   30

 

 

The holders of our common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends and other distributions that our Board of Directors may declare from time to time out of funds legally available for that purpose, if any, after the satisfaction of any prior rights and preferences of any outstanding preferred stock. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of common stock shares will be entitled to share ratably in the distribution of all of our assets remaining available for distribution after satisfaction of all our liabilities and our obligations to holders of our outstanding preferred stock.

Unless our Board of Directors provides otherwise, the shares of all series of preferred stock will rank on parity with respect to the payment of dividends and to the distribution of assets upon liquidation. Any issuance by us of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of our control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.

 

We previously authorized 440 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 20,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and 15,000 shares Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. As of August 20, 2006, all series A, B, and C preferred had been converted into common stock.

If the Company does not pay the dividend within five (5) business days from the end of the calendar month for which the payment of such dividend is owed, the Company will pay the investor a special dividend of an additional 3.5%. Any unpaid or accrued special dividends will be paid upon liquidation or redemption. For any other dividends or distributions, the Series D Preferred Stock participates with common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series D Preferred holders may elect to convert the Series D Preferred Stock, in their sole discretion, at any time after a one-year (1) year holding period, by sending the Company a notice to convert. The conversion rate is equal to the greater of $3.20 or a 20% discount to the average of the three (3) lowest closing market prices of the common stock during the ten (10) trading day period prior to conversion. The Series D Preferred Stock is redeemable from funds legally available for distribution at the option of the individual holders of the Series D Preferred Stock commencing any time after the one (1) year period from the offering closing at a price equal to the initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, provided, that if the Company gave notice to the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred, the Company and the Series D Preferred holders are obligated to negotiate in good faith for an extension of the redemption period. The Company timely notified the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred and the Company and the investors have engaged in ongoing negotiations to determine an appropriate extension period. The Company may elect to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock any time at a price equal to the initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, subject to the investors’ right to convert, by providing written notice about its intent to redeem.

The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly, the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company’s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application of the variable interest model are not present.

 

                                                                   35

Business Overview

 

General

 

The Company’s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) infrastructure.

 

Product sales fluctuate in response to several factors including many that are beyond the Company’s control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, labor availability, and our customers’ production rates and inventory levels. Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality.

 

Operating performance is dependent on the Company’s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.

The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $4,414,986 and a working capital of $324,893 as of March 31, 2024, The company also had an accumulated deficit of $24,473,587 as of March 31, 2024 and used $871,636 in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.

 

                                                                   40

 

 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our total revenue was $1,513,026 compared to $551,869 for the same period in 2023. Our first quarter 2024 total revenue was higher than the same period in 2023 due to deconsolidation of our Shuya entity.

 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit was $253,005 compared to $19,487 for the same period in 2023. The higher gross profit margins were a result of increased revenue from CETY’s non-NG business in China.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our operating expense was $1,073,926 compared to $698,107 for the same period in 2023. The increase in expenses contributed to salaries expenses and professional fees for legal & accounting.

 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $1,419,400 compared to $1,110,390 for the same period in 2023 due to increased in salaries expense contributed to CETY Renewables new engineers and operational and technology directors, fees and marketing campaign expenses attributed to CETY’s expansion plans and loss from deconsolidation of Shuya.

 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, stockholder’s equity was $4,414,986, compared to $5,869,198 as of December 31, 2023. This decrease of $1,454,212 in stockholder’s equity can be attributed to net loss for the quarter.

 

CETY has successfully repositioned itself and created 4 different business segments to create a larger, more stable, and more diversified revenue stream that could scale up. The 4 segments are Clean Energy HRS (Heat Recovery), Waste-to-Energy (Pyrolysis Plant), Engineering Procurement and Consulting (EPC), and CETY HK (NG trading and acquisitions). First quarter revenue was mainly contributed by NG trading. The revenue in this segment is expected to continue to stay stable which will help establish CETY as a player in the China market and allows cross-selling of CETY products and solutions and transfer of advanced clean energy with lower cost technologies. CETY expects larger revenue contribution from Waste-to-Energy, Heat Recovery, and EPC in the latter of this year which are higher gross margin segments. Our pilot Waste-to-Energy plant in Vermont which integrates all of CETY’s technologies and expertise into a single solution, is progressing steadily with updates coming soon. There is a growing market for Heat Recovery in the U.S. and Europe, and CETY HK has begun cross-selling Heat Recovery products in China. CETY is also gearing up for the EPC segment to implement holistic self-generation solutions globally.

 

Management believes this 4-segment strategy has created many operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities across different markets. The growth in the year ended 2024 vs. 2023 was a result of this strategy. CETY believes that it will continue to deliver growth on all segments this year due to our belief that there is an optimistic industry macro backdrop. The main macro factor benefiting us is the global commitment to push renewable energy to the forefront from governments across the world. This is evidenced by the Paris Agreement and COP26. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in August 2022 had specific provisions that can take advantage of CETY’s products and solutions. Another catalyst that will potentially help our Company, is a continuously improving global supply chain. The European energy crisis has given rise to the opportunity for CETY to sell more of its products and solutions as customers are in search of self-generation capabilities in renewable energy.

 

CETY expects to and will continue to execute its corporate strategy to build sustained and profitable growth by providing end to end fully integrated solutions and technologies, expand our global sales and marketing, production, research & development, as well as search for synergistic acquisition opportunities.

Results of the three Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to the three ended March 31, 2023

 

Net Sales

 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our total revenue was $1,513,026 compared to $551,869 for the same period in 2023. The higher revenue was contributed to the deconsolidation of Shya’s business.

 

Segment breakdown

 

The three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing was $9,342 compared to zero for the same period in 2023. Our engineering team is in transition to establish the innovation center in Europe and has executed a master services agreement with RPG to support its fortune 500 customers with its sustainability goals. Additionally, our engineering team will be commencing work on the Vermont project starting in the second quarter of 2023.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from HRS was $72,488 compared to $10,942 for the same period in 2023. We have a large pipeline of opportunities in this segment and are working diligently to complete the engineering and design, enabling us to execute contractual agreements and close these opportunities. The sales cycle for these types of opportunities is long due to cost factors and the integration of the technology. We are also working with financial institutions to assist in financing the projects as we increasingly move towards Independent Power Producer models.

 

For the three months ending March 31, 2024, our revenue from our natural gas (NG) business amounted to $1,219,629, down from $540,927 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to the deconsolidation of Shuya’s revenue and our strategic decision to prioritize non-Chinese markets over expansion into the ASEAN region.

 

Gross Profit

 

In the three months ending March 31, 2024, our gross profits totaled $253,004, marking an favorable increase compared to $160,569 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This uptick in gross profit can be attributed to elevated margins stemming from the increase from our non-Chinese NG business, alongside the successful launch of our waste-to-energy plant in Vermont.

 

Segment breakdown

 

For the three months ending March 31, 2024, our gross profit from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to $7,806, compared for the same period in 2023. This segment is a recent addition to CETY’s portfolio, currently serving as a support for our ongoing internal projects. Nevertheless, it is anticipated to expand notably as CETY shifts its focus towards providing comprehensive end-to-end integrated solutions.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit from HRS was $51,598, in compared to $5,128 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase in margins primarily stemmed from increased service activities, which did not include equipment sales.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit from our wholly owned subsidiary, JHJ, was $9,852, a decrease from $12,959 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to the deconsolidation of the Shuya business unit. It’s worth noting that our NG business typically operates on slim margins. Looking ahead, we intend to leverage our presence in China to foster synergistic partnerships and facilitate technology transfers, particularly in the growing EV charging sector. Additionally, we aim to explore cross-selling opportunities for our waste heat recovery and waste-to-energy products within the Chinese market.

 

                                                                   42

 

 

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.

 

For the three-month period ending March 31, 2024, our SG&A expenses totaled $218,658, an increase from $88,891 for the same period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to increased spending in IT, insurance expenditures particularly the D&O policy, and increased spending on repairs and maintenance, largely driven by the recent relocation of our HRS operations.

 

Salaries Expense

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our Salaries expense totaled $511,111, marking a significant increase from $158,557 recorded during the same period in 2023. This surge in expenses for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, can be attributed to the inclusion of key personnel such as our CFO, director of operations, director of technology, and the recruitment of four additional engineers. Our strategy involves fortifying our team from the ground up to establish a robust foundation for scalable growth, reinforced by cutting-edge technology and streamlined systems. We hold strong conviction in the capabilities of our assembled team, envisioning their collective efforts leading us to a position of leadership within the clean energy sector.

 

Travel Expense

 

The three months ended March 31, 2024; our travel expense was $29,652 compared to $71,662 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to lower travel expenses related to China NG business development.

 

Professional fees legal and accounting

 

For the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, our Professional Fees expense totaled $126,105, marking an increase from $88,210 in the corresponding period of 2023. This rise in accounting fees can be attributed directly to engaging a new audit firm, which incurred higher costs.

 

Facility Lease and Maintenance Expense

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our Facility Lease and maintenance expenses totaled $71,275, marking a significant decrease from the $122,779 incurred during the same period in 2023. This reduction in cost can be attributed to the strategic relocation and separation of our corporate offices from our HRS operations, resulting in a cost-saving measure.

 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

 

The three months ended March 31, 2024, our depreciation and amortization expense was 2,969 compared to $5,949 for the same period in 2023.

 

Change in Derivative Liability

 

The three months ended March 31, 2024; we had no derivative liability compared to a gain of $326,539 for the same period in 2023. The gain in derivative liability was from a favorable derivative calculation from several convertible notes in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Interest and Finance Fees

 

During the three months ending on March 31, 2024, interest and finance fees amounted to $295,193, as opposed to $837,391 for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in interest and fees for the March 31, 2024 period can be attributed to less number of notes and bridge financing aimed at facilitating the uplisting to Nasdaq. Despite the decrease in interest and fees for the March 31, 2024 period, we believe that the cost of capital for CETY remains elevated. The delay in securing affordable financing for our Vermont project resulted in our reliance on high-cost financing options. We are working diligently to finalize our financing in the second quarter of 2024.

 

                                                                   43

 

 

Net Loss

 

For the three months ending March 31, 2024, our loss amounted to $1,419,400, representing an increase from the loss of $1,110,390 incurred during the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is attributed to expenditures in salaries, IT, relocation, and legal and professional fees.

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).

 

Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time

 

FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10

 

An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:

 

a. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).

b. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).

c. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).

 

                                                                   44

 

 

The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business:

 

          ●    Identify the contract with the customer

                

          ●    Identify the performance obligations in the contract

                

          ●    Determine the transaction price

                

          ●    Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

                

          ●    Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

 

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time

 

FASB ASC 606-10-25-30

 

If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

a. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset

b. The customer has legal title to the asset

c. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset

d. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset

e. The customer has accepted the asset

 

The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)

 

The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:

 

     ●    Identify the contract with the customer

     ●    Identify the performance obligations in the contract

     ●    Determine the transaction price

     ●    Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

     ●    Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

 

                                                                   45

 

 

The following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:

 

     ●    We generate a quotation

     ●    We receive Purchase orders from our customers.

     ●    We build the product to their specification

     ●    We invoice at the time of shipment

     ●    The terms are typically Net 30 days

 

The following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:

 

     ●    CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service. 

 

A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):

 

     a.   A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control

           before transfer to the customer may not

           qualify.

     b.   A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide

           the service to the customer on the entity’s

           behalf.

     c.   A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or

           service to the

           customer.

 

If the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.

 

During the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of revenue we recognize in the current period. It’s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections, affecting the revenue recognized accordingly.

 

The projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company.

 

Additionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:

 

Because the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.

 

In recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.

 

     ●    The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the

           performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and

           commissioning.

           

     ●    CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting,

           design, procurement, construction, and

           commissioning.

           

     ●    CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.

           

     ●    The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.

           

     ●    Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.

 

                                                                   46

 

 

Secondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.

 

CETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.

 

CETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.

 

In review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.

 

In reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.

 

Finally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.

 

For CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.

 

During the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.

 

We have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.

 

Given the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.

 

Also, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.

 

Also from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding customer deposits of $210,310 and $80,475 respectively.

 

                                                                   47

 

 

Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation

 

Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.

 

As a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.

 

On January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.

 

Series E Valuation

 

Additionally, the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values.

 

Future Financing

 

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024, for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.
