Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management’s expectations as of the date of this filing and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those described throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, particularly the “Risk Factors” sections of such reports. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made as of the date of this filing, and we do not undertake, and expressly disclaim any duty to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, new developments or otherwise, except to the extent that disclosure may be required by law.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

Ault Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ault Alliance” or the “Company”) is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring and developing undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact. Through its wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries and strategic investments, the Company owns and operates a data center at which it mines Bitcoin and offers colocation and hosting services for the emerging artificial intelligence ecosystems and other industries, and provides mission-critical products that support a diverse range of industries, including metaverse platform, oil exploration, crane services, defense/aerospace, industrial, automotive, medical/biopharma, consumer electronics, hotel operations and textiles. In addition, the Company extends credit to select entrepreneurial businesses through a licensed lending subsidiary.

 

The Company has the following seven reportable segments:

 

     ·    Energy and Infrastructure (“Energy”) – crane operations, advanced textiles processing and oil exploration;

 

     ·    Technology and Finance (“Fintech”) – commercial lending, activist investing, and stock trading;

 

     ·    Sentinum, Inc. (“Sentinum”) – digital assets mining operations and colocation and hosting services for the emerging

           artificial intelligence ecosystems and other

           industries;

 

     ·    Gresham Worldwide, Inc., formerly known as Giga-tronics Incorporated (“GIGA”) – defense industry;

 

     ·    TurnOnGreen – commercial electronics solutions;

 

     ·    ROI – immersive metaverse platform, media, and digital learning; and

 

     ·    Ault Disruptive – a special purpose acquisition company.

 

2. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million, negative working capital of $53.5 million and a history of net operating losses. The Company has financed its operations principally through issuances of convertible debt, promissory notes and equity securities. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

 

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

 

In making this assessment management performed a comprehensive analysis of the Company’s current circumstances, including its financial position, cash flow and cash usage forecasts, as well as obligations and debts. Although management has a long history of successful capital raises, the analysis used to determine the Company’s ability as a going concern does not include cash sources beyond the Company’s direct control that management expects to be available within the next 12 months.

 

Management expects that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and marketable securities as of March 31, 2024, will not be sufficient to enable the Company to fund its anticipated level of operations through one year from the date these financial statements are issued. Management anticipates raising additional capital through the private and public sales of the Company’s equity or debt securities and selling its marketable securities as well as digital assets, or a combination thereof. Although management believes that such capital sources will be available, there can be no assurances that financing will be available to the Company when needed in order to allow the Company to continue its operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company does not raise sufficient capital in a timely manner, among other things, the Company may be forced to scale back or cease its operations altogether.

3. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include all the information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company has made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially from the Company’s estimates. The condensed consolidated financial information is unaudited but reflects all normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. 

 

These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 16, 2024. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited 2023 financial statements contained in the above referenced 2023 Annual Report. Results of the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.

 

Significant Accounting Policies

 

Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

 

Reclassifications

 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current-period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 

On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose specific rate reconciliations, amount of income taxes separated by federal and individual jurisdiction, and the amount of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between federal, state, and foreign. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.

 

On November 27, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is designed to improve the reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.

 

4. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

 

Presentation of Ault Global Real Estate Equities, Inc. (“AGREE”) Operations

 

In September 2023, the Company committed to a plan for its wholly owned subsidiary AGREE to list for sale its four recently renovated Midwest hotels, the Hilton Garden Inn in Madison West, the Residence Inn in Madison West, the Courtyard in Madison West, and the Hilton Garden Inn in Rockford. The decision to sell the hotels follows the decision to also list the multifamily development site in St. Petersburg, Florida and is driven by the Company’s desire to focus on its core businesses, Energy, Fintech and Sentinum.

 

In connection with the planned sale of AGREE assets, the Company concluded that the net assets of AGREE met the criteria for classification as held for sale. In addition, the proposed sale represents a strategic shift that will have a significant effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. As a result, the Company has presented the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of AGREE as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes for all periods presented.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has classified the total assets and total liabilities associated with AGREE as current in the consolidated balance sheets.

Change in Plan of Sale of AGREE Hotel Properties 

 

On April 30, 2024, the Company had a change in plan of sale for its four hotels owned and operated by AGREE. As a result, as of April 30, 2024, the assets will no longer meet the held for sale criteria and will be required to be reclassified as held and used at the lower of adjusted carrying value or the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.

 

                                                                  F-11

The Company assesses the inputs used to measure fair value using the three-tier hierarchy based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. For investments where little or no public market exists, management’s determination of fair value is based on the best available information which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration various factors including earnings history, financial condition, recent sales prices of the issuer’s securities and liquidity risks.

 

Equity Investments for Which Measurement Alternative Has Been Selected

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held equity investments in other securities valued at $20.6 million and $21.8 million, respectively, that were valued using a measurement alternative. These investments are included in other equity securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 

The Company has made cumulative downward adjustments for impairments for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, totaling $0 and $11.6 million, respectively. Approximately $9.6 million of the prior year adjustments are reflected in other income (expense) and $2.0 million of these adjustments related to Fintech lending operations and have been recorded against revenue from lending and trading activities on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

                                                                  F-14

In January 2024, ROI announced that it had concluded that, for regulatory reasons, ROI would be unable to effect the distribution of its shares of common stock of White River as contemplated by a registration statement previously filed by White River.

21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Contingencies

 

Litigation Matters

 

The Company is involved in litigation arising from other matters in the ordinary course of business. The Company is regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil penalties, or other adverse consequences.

 

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the reasonably possible loss. The Company evaluates developments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.

 

With respect to the Company’s other outstanding matters, based on the Company’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 

 

The Company had accrued loss contingencies related to litigation matters $2.4 million and $2.3 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

22. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On January 12, 2024, pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company’s stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders, the Company’s board of directors approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of one-for-twenty-five (the “1-for-25 Reverse Split”). The 1-for-25 Reverse Split did not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock, preferred stock or their respective par value per share. As a result of the 1-for-25 Reverse Split, each twenty-five shares of common stock issued and outstanding prior to the 1-for-25 Reverse Split were converted into one share of common stock. The 1-for-25 Reverse Split became effective in the State of Delaware on January 16, 2024.

 

                                                                  F-24                                                                  



 

 

2023 Issuances

 

Common ATM Offering

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 25.6 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the At-The-Market issuance sales agreement, as amended, entered into with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC in 2023 (the “2023 Common ATM Offering”) for gross proceeds of $14.6 million.

 

Series C Convertible Preferred Stock Offering, Related Party

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold to Ault & Company an aggregate of 2,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 0.6 million shares of Class A common stock, for a total purchase price of $2.0 million.

 

23. INCOME TAXES

 

The Company calculates its interim income tax provision in accordance with ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting, and ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) from continuing operations was 0.4% and (0.6%) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $44,000 and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the ETR and federal statutory rate of 21% is primarily attributable to items recorded for GAAP but permanently disallowed for U.S. federal income tax purposes and changes in valuation allowance.

For the three ended March 31, 2023, net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is the same for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as the effect of the potential common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss position for the period. Anti-dilutive securities, which are convertible into or exercisable for the Company’s common stock, consist of the following at March 31, 2023:

Presentation of AGREE as Discontinued Operations

 

In September 2023, we committed to a plan for our wholly owned subsidiary AGREE to list for sale its four recently renovated Midwest hotels, the Hilton Garden Inn in Madison West, the Residence Inn in Madison West, the Courtyard in Madison West, and the Hilton Garden Inn in Rockford. The decision to sell the hotels follows the decision to also list the multifamily development site in St. Petersburg, Florida and was driven by our desire to focus on our core businesses, Energy, Fintech and Sentinum.

 

In connection with the planned sale of AGREE assets, we concluded that the net assets of AGREE met the criteria for classification as held for sale. In addition, the proposed sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, we have presented the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of AGREE as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes for all periods presented.

 

On April 30, 2024, we had a change in plan of sale for our four hotels owned and operated by AGREE. As a result, as of April 30, 2024, the assets will no longer meet the held for sale criteria and will be required to be reclassified as held and used at the lower of adjusted carrying value or the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.

 

General

 

As a holding company, our business objective is to increase stockholder value through developing and growing our subsidiaries. Under the strategy we have adopted, we are focused on managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to stockholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize stockholder value. We anticipate returning value to stockholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.

 

From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary or partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our stockholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell all or a portion of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, sales of their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these (or similar) initiatives and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our stockholders.

 

In recent years, we have provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of businesses in metaverse platform, oil exploration, crane services, defense/aerospace, industrial, automotive, medical/biopharma, consumer electronics, hotel operations and textiles. We have provided capital to subsidiaries as well as partner companies in which we have an equity interest or may be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support.

Sentinum

 

Revenues from Sentinum’s digital assets mining operations increased $4.1 million due primarily to a 134% increase in the average Bitcoin price, partially offset a 94% increase in the average Bitcoin mining difficulty level in the current quarter period.

 

On April 19, 2024, a Bitcoin halving event occurred on the Bitcoin network. Halving is a key part of the Bitcoin protocol and serves to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in digital assets using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. The Bitcoin halving event reduced the block subsidy by half from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin. Transaction fees are not directly impacted by the halving.

 

Energy

 

Energy revenues from the Circle 8 crane operations increased by $0.3 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Fintech

 

Revenues from our lending and trading activities were $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. On February 14, 2024, ROI transferred 2.5 million shares of White River common stock with a recorded value of $0.5 million and a fair value of $7.5 million at the date of transfer to Ault Lending. As of March 31, 2024, the 2.5 million shares of White River common stock held by Ault Lending had a fair value of $9.4 million and Ault Lending recorded an unrealized gain of $8.9 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 included in revenue from lending and trading activities. Revenues from our lending and trading activities were negative for the three months ended March 31, 2023, due to a $2.0 million impairment related to investments in equity securities, a $1.5 million unrealized loss from our investment in Alzamend and $1.7 million of realized and unrealized losses from our investment portfolio.

 

Revenues from our trading activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included net losses on equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. These gains and losses have caused, and will continue to cause, significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

 

GIGA

 

For the three-month period ending March 31, 2024, GIGA revenues increased by $0.9 million. This growth is driven by ongoing global conflicts and tensions, which have spurred investments in force protection technologies in the United States, U.K., Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

 

                                                                   4                                                                    



 

 

SMC

 

Due to the significant change in our ownership and voting rights, we determined that we no longer met the criteria of the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, we deconsolidated SMC as of November 20, 2023. SMC revenues were $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $3.4 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

 

TurnOnGreen

 

TurnOnGreen's revenues increased by $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This rise was primarily due to higher sales from a single, higher-margin customer in the defense industry during the period ended March 31, 2024.

 

Gross Margins

 

Gross margins increased to 43% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our gross margins of 43% recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by margins from our lending and trading activities, with a positive impact during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a negative impact during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Excluding the effects of margin from our lending and trading activities, our adjusted gross margins for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 would have been 29% and 25%, respectively. Our gross margins improved, in part, due to lower margin revenue from SMC during the three months ended March 31, 2023. We deconsolidated SMC as of November 20, 2023.

 

Research and Development

 

Research and development expenses decreased by $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to lower expenditures related to development work on ROI’s BitNile metaverse platform.

 

Selling and Marketing

 

Selling and marketing expenses were $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $8.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 47%. The decrease was primarily the result of a $3.4 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses at ROI primarily due to lower advertising and promotion costs and a $0.8 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation of SMC as of November 20, 2023.

 

General and Administrative

 

General and administrative expenses were $13.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $8.2 million, or 38%. General and administrative expenses decreased from the comparative prior period, mainly due to the following:

 

          ·    $5.2 million lower stock compensation expense;



          ·    $2.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation of SMC as of November

                20, 2023;

                and



          ·    $0.7 million lower performance bonus related to realized gains on trading activities.

 

Other Expense, Net

 

Other income, net was $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to other expense, net of $16.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Interest and other income was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to the decline in Ault Disruptive’s cash and marketable securities held in the trust account as a result of redemptions of Ault Disruptive common stock subject to possible redemption.

 

                                                                   5                                                                    



 

 

Interest expense was $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $12.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included contractual interest of $1.3 million, amortization of debt discount of $2.1 million, and forbearance and extension fees of $1.5 million. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included amortization of debt discount of $10.4 million, contractual interest of $1.1 million, and forbearance and extension fees of $0.6 million.

 

Gain on conversion of investment in equity securities to marketable equity securities of $17.9 million relates to ROI conversion of White River common stock. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, ROI transferred 6.7 million shares of White River common stock with a fair value of $19.2 million at the date of transfer. In conjunction with the transfers, ROI converted a portion of their White River’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock and recorded a noncash $17.9 million gain on conversion.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, ROI converted $2.3 million of ROI senior secured convertible notes that had a fair value of $0.9 million at the time of conversion and recognized a $1.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt.

 

Loss from investment in unconsolidated entity was $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, representing our share of losses from our equity method investment in SMC.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the provision for loan losses on the related party note receivable from Ault & Company was $3.1 million, due to uncertainties regarding collection. This compares to no provision for the same period in 2023.

 

Income Tax Benefit

 

The income tax benefit was $44,000 and $0.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax benefit rate was 0.4% and (0.6%) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

On March 31, 2024, excluding cash and cash equivalents from discontinued operations, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million (excluding restricted cash of $5.5 million), compared to cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million (excluding restricted cash of $5.0 million) at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due cash provided by financing activities related to the sale of common and preferred stock, as well as proceeds from notes payable and convertible notes, partially offset by the payment of debt, purchases of property and equipment and cash used in operating activities.

 

Net cash used in operating activities totaled $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included $8.6 million proceeds from the sale of digital assets from our Sentinum Bitcoin mining operations, offset by operating losses and changes in working capital. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included $1.7 million cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations.

 

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily related to $0.9 million capital expenditures and $0.6 million cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations.

 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and primarily reflects the following transactions:

 

     ·    During the period between January 1, 2024 through March 13, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 25.6 million shares of common stock

           pursuant to the 2023 Common ATM Offering for gross proceeds of $14.6 million and effective March 14, 2024, the 2023 Common

           ATM Offering was

           terminated;

 

     ·    $2.0 million proceeds from sales of Series C preferred stock, related party;

 

     ·    $1.5 million proceeds from subsidiaries’ sale of stock to non-controlling interests;

 

     ·    $1.9 million payments on notes payable, related party;

 

     ·    $1.3 million payments of preferred dividends;

 

     ·    $5.2 million payments on notes payable, partially offset by $2.3 million proceeds from notes payable; and

 

     ·    $1.8 million proceeds from convertible notes payable, partially offset by $1.0 million payments on convertible notes payable.

 

Net provided by financing activities from discontinued operations was $1.1 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

                                                                   6                                                                    



 

 

Financing Transactions Subsequent to March 31, 2024

 

On April 17, 2024, we sold to Ault & Company 500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 0.1 million shares of Class A common stock, for a total purchase price of $0.5 million.

 

On April 29, 2024, we entered into a $1.7 million term note agreement with an institutional investor bearing interest of 15%. The term note was issued at a discount, with net proceeds to us of $1.6 million. The term note was scheduled to mature May 17, 2024. On May 16, 2024, the due date was extended to June 15, 2024.

 

On May 16, 2024, we entered into a $0.5 million term note agreement with an institutional investor bearing interest of 15%. The term note is scheduled to mature June 15, 2024.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

 

 ITEM 3.           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.

 

 ITEM 4.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon our evaluation, each of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report because the Company has not yet completed its remediation of the material weakness previously identified and disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the end of its most recent fiscal year.

 

Management has identified the following material weaknesses:

 

          1.   We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting department, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and

                properly review information related to financial reporting, including applying complex accounting principles relating

                to consolidation accounting, related party transactions, fair value estimates and analysis of financial instruments

                for proper classification in the consolidated financial statements, in a timely

                manner;

 

          2.   Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be

                economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the

                recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure

                to have segregation of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the

                control deficiency that resulted represented a material

                weakness;

 

          3.   Our primary user access controls (i.e., provisioning, de-provisioning, privileged access and user access reviews) to

                ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access

                to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented

                effectively. We did not design and/or implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain

                financially relevant systems affecting our processes;

                and

 

          4.   The Company did not design and/or implement user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties or program

                change management controls for certain financially relevant systems impacting the Company’s processes around revenue

                recognition and digital assets to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting the Company’s (i) financial IT

                applications, (ii) digital assets mining equipment, and (iii) underlying accounting records, are identified, tested,

                authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and

                accurate. Automated process-level controls and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from

                such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency. In addition,

                the Company has not effectively designed a manual key control to detect material misstatements in

                revenue.

 

                                                                   7                                                                    



 

 

Planned Remediation

 

Management continues to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding our IT systems and applications. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate material weaknesses, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) enhancing design and documentation related to both user access and change management processes and control activities; and (ii) developing and communicating additional policies and procedures to govern the area of IT change management. In order to achieve the timely implementation of the above, management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis:

 

     ·    Engaging a third-party specialist to assist management with improving the Company’s overall control environment, focusing on

           change management and access

           controls;

 

     ·    Implementing new applications and systems that are aligned with management’s focus on creating strong internal controls; and

 

     ·    Continuing to increase headcount across the Company, with a particular focus on hiring individuals with strong Sarbanes Oxley

           and internal control

           backgrounds.

 

We are currently working to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

 

Despite the existence of these material weaknesses, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the period covered by this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.

 

Except as detailed above, during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   8                                                                    



 

 

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION

 

 ITEM 1.           LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

Litigation Matters

 

The Company is involved in litigation arising from other matters in the ordinary course of business. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil penalties, or other adverse consequences.

 

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.

 

With respect to our other outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.
