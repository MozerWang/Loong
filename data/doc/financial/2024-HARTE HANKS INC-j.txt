Harte Hanks, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note A - Overview and Significant Accounting Policies

Background

Harte Hanks, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (“Harte Hanks,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading global customer experience company. With offices in North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Harte Hanks works with some of the world’s most respected brands.

Segment Reporting

The Company operates four reportable segments: Marketing Services; Customer Care; Sales Services; and Fulfillment & Logistics Services. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is considered to be our chief operating decision maker. Our CEO reviews our operating results on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance by using the three financial measures: revenue, operating income and operating income plus depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Accounting Principles 

Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 10-K”).

Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Harte Hanks, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As used in this report, the terms “Harte Hanks,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Harte Hanks, Inc., one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, as the context may require.

Interim Financial Information

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S.GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 

Use of Estimates

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to uncertainties. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates related to lease accounting; pension accounting; fair value for purposes of assessing long-lived assets for impairment; revenue recognition; income taxes; stock-based compensation and contingencies. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates and assumptions based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in revised estimates and assumptions.

Operating Expense Presentation in Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

The “Labor” line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss includes all employee payroll and benefits costs, including stock-based compensation and temporary labor costs. The “Production and distribution” and “Advertising, selling, general and administrative” lines do not include any labor, depreciation, or amortization expense.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services based on the relevant contract. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model:

•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer

•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract

•Determination of the transaction price

•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

•Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation

Certain client programs provide for adjustments to billings based upon whether we achieve certain performance criteria. In these circumstances, revenue is recognized when the foregoing conditions are met. We record revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Any payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered. Costs incurred for search engine marketing solutions payable to the engine host and postage costs of mailings are billed to our clients and are not directly reflected in our revenue.

Revenue from agency and digital services, direct mail, logistics, fulfillment and contact center is recognized when the work is performed. Fees for these services are determined by the terms set forth in each contract. These fees are typically a set fixed price or rate by transaction occurrence, service provided, time spent, or product delivered.

For arrangements requiring design and build of a database, revenue is not recognized until client acceptance occurs. Up-front fees billed during the setup phase for these arrangements are deferred and direct build costs are capitalized. Pricing for these types of arrangements is typically based on a fixed price determined in the contract. Revenue from other database marketing solutions is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Pricing for these services is typically based on a fixed price per month or per contract.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, (“ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies into three levels:



Level 1       Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2       Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in

               markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for

               substantially the full term of the assets or

               liabilities.

Level 3       Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the

               assets or

               liabilities.

Because of their maturities and/or variable interest rates, certain financial instruments have fair values approximating their carrying values. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade payables, and long-term debt. The fair value of the assets in our funded pension plan is discussed in Note H, Employee Benefit Plans.

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating and finance leases are included in the lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and in the current portion and long-term portion of lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of each lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of each lease to determine the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are included in the lease ROU assets when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain real estate leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Note B - Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the FASB issued accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2023-07, which enhances the disclosures required for reportable segments in annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning with the fiscal year ending November 30, 2025, and for interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which requires enhanced income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and disaggregated information related to income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for the fiscal year ending after November 30, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this update will have on its disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

No other new accounting pronouncements recently adopted or issued had or are expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note C - Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that are within the scope of the new standard, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This standard also includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.

Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Our contracts with customers state the terms of sale, including the description, quantity, and price of the product sold or service provided. Payment terms can vary by contract, but the period between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. The Company's contracts with its customers generally do not include rights of return or a significant financing component.

Consistent with GAAP, we present sales taxes assessed on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.

Disaggregation of Revenue 

We disaggregate revenue by four key revenue streams which are aligned with our reportable segments. The nature of the services offered by each key revenue stream is different. The following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 by our four reportable segments and the pattern of revenue recognition:

Our contracts with customers may consist of multiple performance obligations. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. For most performance obligations, we determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. Although uncommon, if the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Further discussion of other performance obligations in each of our major revenue streams follows: 

Marketing Services

Our Marketing Services segment delivers strategic planning, data strategy, performance analytics, creative development and execution, technology enablement, marketing automation, and database management. We create relevancy by leveraging data, insight, and our extensive experience in leading clients as they engage their customers through digital, traditional, and emerging channels. We are known for helping clients build deep customer relationships, create connected customer experiences, and optimize each and every customer touch point in order to deliver desired business outcomes.

Most marketing services performance obligations are satisfied over time and often offered on a per project basis. We have concluded that the best approach to measure the progress toward completion of the project-based performance obligations is the input method, which is based on either the costs or labor hours incurred to date depending upon whether costs or labor hours more accurately depict the transfer of value to the customer.

Our database solutions are built around centralized marketing databases with services rendered to build custom database, database hosting services, customer or target marketing lists and data processing services.

These performance obligations, including services rendered to build a custom database, database hosting services, customer or target marketing lists and data processing services, may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. We provide software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions to host data for customers and have concluded that these solutions are stand-ready obligations to be recognized over time on a monthly basis. Our promise to provide certain data related services meets the over-time recognition criteria because our services do not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have an enforceable right to payment. For performance obligations recognized over time, we choose either the input (i.e., labor hour) or output method (i.e., number of customer records) to measure the progress toward completion depending on the nature of the services provided. Some of our other data-related services do not meet the over-time criteria and are therefore, recognized at a point-in-time, typically upon the delivery of a specific deliverable.

Our contracts may include outsourced print production work for our clients. These contracts may include a promise to purchase postage on behalf of our clients. In such cases, we have determined we are an agent, rather than principal and therefore recognize net consideration as revenue.

Customer Care 

We deliver customer care services in the United States, Asia, and Europe to provide advanced solutions such as voice, SMS/chat, email, integrated voice response, web self-service, social cloud monitoring, and analytics.

Performance obligations are stand-ready obligations and are satisfied over time. With regard to account management and SaaS, we use a time-elapsed output method to recognize revenue. For performance obligations where we charge customers a transaction-based fee, we use the output method based on transaction quantities. In most cases, our contracts provide us the right to invoice for services provided, therefore, we generally use the “as invoiced” practical expedient to recognize revenue associated with these performance obligations unless significant discounts are offered in a contract and prices for services do not represent their SSPs.

Sales Services

Our Sales Services segment enables customers to optimize their go-to-market function by offering a range of outsourced services including sales process optimization, sales play development, inbound lead qualification and outbound sales prospecting.

Performance obligations are stand-ready obligations and are satisfied over time. With regard to account management and SaaS, we use a time-elapsed output method to recognize revenue. For performance obligations where we charge customers a transaction-based fee, we use the output method based on transaction quantities. In most cases, our contracts provide us the right to invoice for services provided, therefore, we generally use the “as invoiced” practical expedient to recognize revenue associated with these performance obligations unless significant discounts are offered in a contract and prices for services do not represent their SSPs.

Fulfillment & Logistics Services

Our services, delivered internally and with our partners, include printing, lettershop, advanced mail optimization (including commingling services), logistics and transportation optimization, monitoring and tracking, to support traditional and specialized mailings. Our print and fulfillment centers in Massachusetts and Kansas provide custom kitting services, print on demand, product recall support, trade marketing fulfillment, ecommerce product fulfillment, sampling programs, and freight optimization, thereby allowing our customers to efficiently and effectively distribute literature and other marketing materials.

Most performance obligations offered within this revenue stream are satisfied over time and utilize the input or output method, depending on the nature of the service, to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. For performance obligations where we charge customers a transaction-based fee, we utilize the output method based on the quantities fulfilled. Services provided through our fulfillment centers are typically priced at a per transaction basis and our contracts provide us the right to invoice for services provided and reflects the value to the customer of the services transferred to date. In most cases, we use the “as invoiced” practical expedient to recognize revenue associated with these performance obligations unless significant discounts are offered in a contract and prices for services do not represent their standalone selling prices. Prior to the closure of our direct mail production facilities, our direct mail business contracts may have included a promise to purchase postage on behalf of our clients; in such cases, we have determined we are an agent, rather than principal and therefore recognize net consideration as revenue.

Transaction Price Allocated to Future Performance Obligations 

We have elected to apply certain optional exemptions that limit the disclosure requirements over remaining performance obligations at period end to exclude the performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less, transactions using the “as invoiced” practical expedient, or when a performance obligation is a series and we have allocated the variable consideration directly to the services performed. As of March 31, 2024, we had no transaction prices allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.

Contract Balances

We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing when we have an unconditional right to consideration (only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due) and a contract asset when the right to payment is conditional upon our future performance such as delivery of an additional good or service (e.g. customer contract requires customer’s final acceptance of custom database solution or the delivery of a final marketing strategy presentation before customer payment is required). If invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition, the unearned revenue is presented on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as a contract liability, referred to as deferred revenue.

Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period was approximately $2.3 million. Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period was approximately $2.0 million. 

Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract

We recognize an asset for the direct costs incurred to obtain and fulfill our contracts with customers to the extent that we expect to recover these costs and if the benefit is longer than one year. These costs are amortized to expense over the expected period of the benefit in a manner that is consistent with the transfer of the related goods or services to which the asset relates. We impair the asset when recoverability is not anticipated. We capitalized a portion of commission expense, implementation and other costs that represents the cost to obtain a contract. The remaining unamortized contract costs were $0.4 million and $0.6 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. They are included in other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For the periods presented, no impairment was recognized.

Note D - Leases

We have operating and finance leases for corporate and business offices, service facilities, call centers and certain equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are generally not recorded on the balance sheet, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option to renew the arrangement, that we are reasonably certain to exercise (short-term lease). Our leases have remaining lease terms of one to eight years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to an additional five years.

As of March 31, 2024, assets recorded under finance and operating leases were approximately $0.2 million and $24.3 million, respectively, and accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, assets recorded under finance and operating leases were approximately $0.1 million and $25.3 million, respectively, and accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $0.1 million. Operating lease right of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the commencement date present value of lease payment is the interest rate implicit in the lease, or when that is not readily determinable, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received.

There was no impairment of leases during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to our financing and operating leases:

Share Repurchase Program

On May 2, 2023, the Board of Directors of Harte Hanks approved a share repurchase program to maximize shareholder value with authorization to repurchase $6.5 million of the Company’s Common Stock. In the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we didn't repurchase any shares of common stock.

Note F — Long-Term Debt

Credit Facility

On December 21, 2021, the Company entered into a three-year, $25.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with Texas Capital Bank ("TCB"). The Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Company’s material subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2021, among the Company, TCB and the other Guarantors party thereto (the "Security Agreement"). On December 29, 2023, the Company extended the maturity date for the Credit Facility by a period of six months to June 30, 2025. The extension was executed with substantially similar terms and conditions as the original Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility provides for loans up to the lesser of (a) $25.0 million, and (b) the amount available under a “borrowing base” calculated primarily by reference to the Company's cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. The Credit Facility allows the Company to use up to $3.0 million of its borrowing capacity to issue letters of credit. 

The loans under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate was 7.68% as of March 31, 2024. The outstanding amounts advanced under the Credit Facility are due and payable in full on June 30, 2025. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. No amounts were drawn against these letters of credit at March 31, 2024. These letters of credit exist to support insurance programs relating to worker’s compensation and general liability. Unused commitment balances accrue fees at a rate of 0.25%.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the ability to borrow $24.0 million and $24.2 million, respectively, under the New Credit Facility.

Note G — Stock-Based Compensation

We maintain stock incentive plans for the benefit of certain officers, directors, and employees. Our stock incentive plans provide for the ability to issue stock options, cash stock appreciation rights, performance stock units, phantom stock units and cash performance stock units. Our cash stock appreciation rights, phantom stock units and cash performance stock units settle solely in cash and are treated as the current liability, which are adjusted each reporting period based on changes in our stock price.

Compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair values of the awards on the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award in the “Labor” line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We recognized $0.6 million and $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Note H — Employee Benefit Plans

Prior to January 1, 1999, we provided a defined benefit pension plan for which most of our employees were eligible to participate (the “Qualified Pension Plan”). In conjunction with significant enhancements to our 401(k) plan, we elected to freeze benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan as of December 31, 1998.

In 1994, we adopted a non-qualified, unfunded, supplemental pension plan (the “Restoration Pension Plan”) covering certain employees, which provides for incremental pension payments so that total pension payments equal those amounts that would have been payable from the principal pension plan were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulation. The benefits under the Restoration Pension Plan were intended to provide benefits equivalent to our Qualified Pension Plan as if such plan had not been frozen. We elected to freeze benefits under the Restoration Pension Plan as of April 1, 2014.

At the end of 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the division of the Qualified Pension Plan into two distinct plans, “Qualified Pension Plan I” and “Qualified Pension Plan II.” The assets and liabilities of the Qualified Pension Plan that were attributable to certain participants in Qualified Pension Plan II were spun off and transferred into Qualified Pension Plan II effective as of the end of December 31, 2021, in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 414(I) and ERISA Section 4044.

In January 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the termination of the Qualified Pension Plan I. The termination process will take approximately 18 months to complete and will result in the transfer of our obligations pursuant to this pension plan to a third-party provider. We expect to make a cash contribution of $7.6 million to terminate the Qualified Pension Plan I.

The overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit post-retirement plans is recorded as an asset or liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. Periodic changes in the funded status are recognized through other comprehensive income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We currently measure the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of December 31, the date of our year-end Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Net pension cost for both plans included the following components:



                                                              Three Months Ended March 31,

Based on current estimates, we will be required to make a $2.0 million contribution to the combined qualified Pension Plan in 2024. We made $0.3 million of such $2.0 million aggregate contribution in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Table of Contents

We are not required to make, and do not intend to make, any contributions to our Restoration Pension Plan in 2024 other than to the extent needed to cover benefit payments. We made benefit payments under this supplemental plan of $0.5 million and $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note I - Income Taxes

The income tax benefit was $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective income tax rate of 29.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 40.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the U.S. state income taxes and the impact of income earned in foreign jurisdictions. 

Harte Hanks, or one of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. state, federal and foreign returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2018. The Company has reviewed all of its tax positions in order to determine whether all, a portion, or none of any related tax benefit should be recognized and has not identified or recorded any ASC 740-10 reserve.

We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to income taxes within income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We did not have a significant amount of interest or penalties accrued at March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Note J - Loss Per Share

Basic loss per share (“EPS”) is calculated using income available to common stockholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock including both shares outstanding and shares potentially issuable in connection with restricted common stock awards and stock option under our stock incentive plans. 

Reconciliations of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:



                                                                                         Three Months Ended March 31,

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the following shares have been excluded from the calculation of shares used in the diluted EPS calculation: 312,723 and 9,921 shares of anti-dilutive market price options; 43,780 and zero of anti-dilutive unvested restricted shares.

Reclassification amounts related to the defined pension plans are included in the computation of net periodic pension benefit cost (see Note H, Employee Benefit Plans). 

Note L — Litigation and Contingencies

In the normal course of our business, we are obligated under some agreements to indemnify our clients as a result of third party claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, or third party claims relating to other ad hoc contract obligations. The terms and duration of these commitments vary and, in some cases, may be indefinite, and some of these contractual commitments do not limit the maximum amount of future payments we could become obligated to make thereunder; accordingly, our actual aggregate maximum exposure related to these types of commitments is not reasonably estimable. Historically, we have not been obligated to make significant payments for obligations of this nature, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to various claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of conducting our businesses and, from time to time, we may become involved in additional claims and lawsuits incidental to our businesses. We routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses; to the extent losses are reasonably estimable. Accruals are recorded for these matters to the extent that management concludes a loss is probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonable estimable.

In the opinion of management, appropriate and adequate accruals for legal matters have been made, and management believes that the probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued is remote. Nevertheless, we cannot predict the impact of future developments affecting our pending or future claims and lawsuits. We expense legal costs as incurred, and all recorded legal liabilities are adjusted as required as better information becomes available to us. The factors we consider when recording an accrual for contingencies include, among others: (i) the opinions and views of our general counsel and outside legal counsel; (ii) our previous experience with similar claims; and (iii) the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints.

Note M — Restructuring Activities

During the second half of 2023, we engaged a consulting firm to help review and analyze the structure and operations of the Company. This review included greater than 200 meetings with personnel at all levels of the firm and led to the initiation of our transformation program named "Project Elevate". The program involves the optimization and rationalization of our business resources as well as the partial reinvestment of savings into the Company's sales and marketing team, technology, and strategy. A business transformation office was established at the beginning of 2024 to manage and measure these initiatives. Reorganization cost reductions from Project Elevate during 2024 through 2026 are estimated to be $16.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.7 million. We expect to incur total restructuring charges of $10.1 million through the end of 2024. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.9 million.

The following table summarizes the restructuring charges which are recorded in “Restructuring Expense” in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Beginning in 2024, we have organized our operations into four reportable segments based on the types of products and services we provide: Marketing Services, Customer Care, Sales Services and Fulfillment & Logistics Services. The Sales Service is our new reportable segment for 2024 as it has become strategically more important for our company. It was included in Customer Care segment in 2023. 2023 segment reporting has been restated to reflect this change.

Our Marketing Services segment leverages data, insight, and experience to support clients as they engage customers through digital, traditional, and emerging channels. We partner with clients to develop strategies and tactics to identify and prioritize customer audiences in B2C and B2B transactions. Our key service offerings include strategic business, brand, marketing and communications planning, data strategy, audience identification and prioritization, predictive modeling, creative development and execution across traditional and digital channels, website and app development, platform architecture, database build and management, marketing automation, and performance measurement, reporting and optimization. 

Our Customer Care segment offers intelligently responsive contact center solutions, which use real-time data to effectively interact with each customer. Customer contacts are handled through phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging, chat and digital self-service support. We provide these services utilizing our advanced technology infrastructure, human resource management skills and industry experience.

Our Sales Services segment enables customers to optimize their go-to-market function by offering a range of outsourced services including sales process optimization, sales play development, inbound lead qualification and outbound sales prospecting.

Our Fulfillment & Logistics segment consists of mail and product fulfillment and logistics services. We offer a variety of product fulfillment solutions, including printing on demand, managing product recalls, and distributing literature and promotional products to support B2B trade, drive marketing campaigns, and improve customer experience. We are also a provider of third-party logistics and freight optimization in the United States. 

There are three principal financial measures reported to our CEO (the chief operating decision maker) for use in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. Those measures are revenue, operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). Operating income for segment reporting disclosed below, is revenues less operating costs and allocated corporate expenses. Segment operating expenses include allocations of certain centrally incurred costs such as employee benefits, occupancy, information systems, accounting services, internal legal staff, and human resources administration. These costs are allocated based on actual usage or other appropriate methods. Unallocated corporate expenses are corporate overhead expenses not attributable to the operating groups. Interest income and expense are not allocated to the segments. The Company does not allocate assets to our reportable segments for internal reporting purposes, nor does our CEO evaluate reportable segments using discrete asset information. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the Note A, Overview and Significant Accounting Policies.

The following table presents financial information by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2024:

Overview

The following MD&A section is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Harte Hanks, including any material changes in the Company’s financial condition and results of operations since December 31, 2023, and as compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included herein as well as our 2023 10-K. Our 2023 10-K contains a discussion of other matters not included herein, such as disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates, and contractual obligations. See Note A, Overview and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Harte Hanks, Inc. is a leading global customer experience company operating in four reportable segments: Marketing Services, Customer Care, Sales services and Fulfillment & Logistics Services. Our mission is to partner with clients to provide them with a robust customer-experience, or CX, strategy, data-driven analytics and actionable insights combined with seamless program execution to better understand, attract, and engage their customers. Our services include strategic planning, data strategy, performance analytics, creative development and execution; technology enablement; marketing automation; B2B and B2C e-commerce; cross-channel customer care; and product, print, and mail fulfillment. 

We are affected by the general, national, and international economic and business conditions in the markets where we and our customers operate. Marketing budgets are largely discretionary in nature and, as a consequence, are easier for our clients to reduce in the short-term than other expenses. Our revenues are also affected by the economic fundamentals of each industry that we serve, various market factors, including the demand for services by our clients, the financial condition of and budgets available to our clients, and regulatory factors, among other factors. Due to the recent increases in inflation and interest rates throughout the globe, and other geopolitical uncertainties, including but not limited to the ongoing armed conflicts in multiple regions, there is continued uncertainty and significant volatility and disruption in the

global economy and financial markets. We remain committed to making the investments necessary to execute our multichannel strategy while also continuing to adjust our cost structure to appropriately reflect our operations and outlook. 

Management is closely monitoring inflation and wage pressure in the market, and the potential impact on our business. While inflation has not had a material impact on our business, it is possible a material increase in inflation could have an impact on our clients, and in turn, on our business.

Recent Developments

Project Elevate

Our management team continuously reviews and adjusts our cost structure and operating footprint to optimize our operations, and invest in improved technology. During the second half of 2023, we engaged a consulting firm to help review and analyze the structure and operations of the Company. This review included greater than 200 meetings with personnel at all levels of the firm and led to the initiation of our transformation program named "Project Elevate". The program involves the optimization and rationalization of our business resources as well as the partial reinvestment of savings into the Company's sales and marketing team, technology, and strategy. A business transformation office was established at the beginning of 2024 to manage and measure these initiatives. Reorganization savings from Project Elevate executed from 2024 to 2025 are estimated to reach as much as $16.0 million.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred total restructuring charges of $5.7 million including $4.6 million of operational efficiency consulting, $0.9 million in real estate consolidation, and $0.2 million of other related costs.

Changes in Segment Reporting 

Starting in the first quarter of 2024, to improve our strategic posture in terms of go-to-market approach and cost structure, we removed the Sales Services business from the Customer Care segment to become its own segment.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses were $45.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 , a decrease of $1.0 million, or 2.2%, compared to $46.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Labor expense decreased $1.0 million, or 4.0%, primarily due to the reduction in workforce in our Marketing Services segment.

Production and Distribution expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to lower transportation services cost associated with the lower Fulfillment & Logistics segment revenue as compared to the prior year quarter. 

Advertising, Selling, General and Administrative expenses decreased $0.1 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to lower professional services expenses. 

The largest components of our operating expenses are labor, transportation expenses and outsourced costs. Each of these costs is, at least in part, variable and tends to fluctuate in line with revenues and the demand for our services. Transportation rates have increased over the last few years due to demand and supply fluctuations within the transportation industry. Future changes in transportation expenses will continue to impact our total production costs and total operating expenses, and in turn our margins, and may have an impact on future demand for our supply chain management services. Postage costs for mailings are borne by our clients and are not directly reflected in our revenues or expenses.

Other expense (income), net

Other expense, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.6 million compared to $2.4 million, in the prior year quarter . The $1.8 million decrease in other expense, net was mainly associated with changes in foreign currency gain and loss account.

Income Taxes

The income tax benefit of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 represents an increase in income tax provision of $0.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate was 29.3% for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 10.9% from the effective tax rate of 40.2% for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the U.S. state income taxes and income earned in foreign jurisdictions.

Segment Results

The following is a discussion and analysis of the results of our reportable segments for the three months ended three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. There are four principal financial measures reported to our CEO (the chief operating decision maker) for use in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. Those measures are revenue, operating income and operating income plus depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). For additional information, see Note N, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Income was $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to operating income of $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Operating Income was $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to operating income of $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $0.6 million increase was contributed by the increased revenue volume.

Fulfillment & Logistics Services:



                                                  Three Months Ended March 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our cash and cash equivalent balances were $11.5 million and $18.4 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had the ability to borrow an additional 24.0 million under our Credit Facility. 

We received a $5.3 million tax refund in March 2023, as a result of the tax NOL carryback provisions in the CARES Act.

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings available under our Credit Facility. Our cash is primarily used for general corporate purposes, working capital requirements, and capital expenditures. At this time, we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our liquidity requirements and fund our fixed obligations such as finance and operating leases and unfunded pension plan benefit payments and other needs for our operations in the short term and beyond. Although the Company believes that it will be able to meet its cash needs for the short and medium term, if unforeseen circumstances arise the Company may need to seek alternative sources of liquidity.

The $7.4 million year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $4.6 million changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses balances, $4.1 million change in prepaid expenses, income tax receivable and other current assets balances, as well as $2.3 million change in accounts receivable and contract assets balances. The above decrease was partially offset by a $2.5 million change in other accrued expenses and liabilities balances in the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is comparable to the $0.6 million used in the same period in 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $0.3 million of net cash used in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $0.1 million decrease was primarily related to the change in Treasury stock activities.

Foreign Holdings of Cash

Consolidated foreign holdings of cash as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $4.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

Long Term Debt

On December 21, 2021, the Company entered into a three-year, $25.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with Texas Capital Bank ("TCB"). The Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Company’s material subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2021, among the Company, TCB and the other Guarantors party thereto (the "Security Agreement"). On December 29, 2023, the Company extended the maturity date for the Credit Facility by a period of six months, to June 30, 2025. The extension was executed with substantially similar terms and conditions as the original Facility.

The Credit Facility provides for loans up to the lesser of (a) $25.0 million, and (b) the amount available under a "borrowing base" calculated primarily by reference to the Company's cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. The Credit Facility allows the Company to use up to $3.0 million of its borrowing capacity to issue letters of credit.

The loans under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. The latest rate was 7.68% as of March 31, 2024. The outstanding amounts advanced under the Credit Facility are due and payable in full on June 30, 2025.

The Company may repay and reborrow all or any portion of the loans advanced under the Credit Facility at any time, without premium or penalty. The Credit Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments (i) from the net proceeds of asset dispositions not otherwise permitted under the Credit Facility; (ii) if the unpaid principal balance under the Credit Facility plus the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters of credit exceeds the borrowing base; (iii) in an amount equal to 50% of the net proceeds of issuances of capital stock (subject to customary exceptions); or (iv) in an amount equal to the net proceeds from any issuance of debt not otherwise permitted under the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility contains certain covenants restricting the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to create, incur, assume or become liable for indebtedness; make certain investments; pay dividends or repurchase the Company's stock; create, incur or assume liens; consummate mergers or acquisitions; liquidate, dissolve, suspend or cease operations; or modify accounting or tax reporting methods (other than as required by U.S. GAAP).

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. At each of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 million and

$0.8 million, respectively. No amounts were drawn against these letters of credit at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These letters of credit exist to support insurance programs relating to workers’ compensation and general liability. We had no other off-balance sheet financing activities at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, we had the ability to borrow $24.0 million under the Credit Facility. 

Dividends

We did not pay any dividends in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Share Repurchase

On May 2, 2023, the Board of Directors of Harte Hanks approved a share repurchase program to maximize shareholder value with authorization to repurchase $6.5 million of the Company’s Common Stock. During 2023, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of common stock for a total combined purchase price of $2.4 million. We didn't repurchase any stock during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Outlook

We consider such factors as total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, current assets, current liabilities, total debt, revenues, operating income, cash flows from operations, investing activities, and financing activities when assessing our liquidity. Our management of cash is designed to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure that it is readily available to meet our operating, investing, and financing requirements as they arise. We believe that there are no conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical and Recent Accounting Policies

Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Refer to the 2023 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.

Our Significant Accounting policies are described in Note A, Overview and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
