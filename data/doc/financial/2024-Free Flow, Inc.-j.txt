Free Flow, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
March 31, 2024 and 2023
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTIONS 
Free Flow, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on October 28, 2011 under the laws of State of Delaware to enter the green energy industry. It began with the idea of developing swimming pool solar pump system. The solar energy business became very volatile due to constant decline in prices of solar panels. The Company could not conclude any business in the solar energy sector. In February 2016 the Company formed a subsidiary namely JK Sales, Corp. (name changed to “Accurate Auto Sales, Inc.”) and began the business of selling used auto parts.  
Accurate Auto Sales, Inc., at a 19+ acre facility that it owned, in King George, VA, bought end of life and wrecked automobiles from Insurance Auctions and disassembled the same to parts. After the dis-assembly these parts were labelled and stored at its warehouse, the inventory is uploaded and sold through a very sophisticated internet network. The primary customers were auto body and mechanic shops. Accurate Auto Parts, Inc. sold this facility on March 4, 2024 and is now looking into trading of used auto parts.  
In December 2020 the Company acquired the Assets of Inside Auto Parts, Inc. incorporated in 1993, which is centrally located between Richmond, Charlottesville, and Fredericksburg, Virginia with easy access to main transport routs. The salvage dealership, specializing in used foreign car and truck parts has been acquired by Free Flow, Inc. subsidiary named “FFLO - Inside Auto Parts, Inc.” and has 21,953.9 square feet fully enclosed and another 17,392.35 square feet under roof enclosed on 3 sides, all located on 16 acres of land in Mineral, Virginia then owned by FFLO. After over a year the assets were resold to the seller. The primary reason not to continue was the Company’s inability to get financing to pay off acquisition debt.
Subsequent to receipt, by another subsidiary of FFLO – namely Motors & Metals, Inc., of an LOI from an overseas buyer the Company planned to set up a “Scrap Metal Processing” plant and sought funding for equipment. A contract for purchase of equipment was intended to be executed with a Chinese equipment manufacturer, but due to Covid 19 pandemic the transaction came to a halt. Also, the Government of China put an embargo to finance US projects. However, Motors & Metals, Inc., diversified its efforts and began in physical trading of scrap metal and continues to do so.  
On March 4, 2024 the Company sold its 10+ acre facility for a gross sum of $1,700,000 and continues to operate the salvage yard under a concession agreement which is at will be both parties.
We have prepared the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applicable to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information related to our significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. Theses Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect, in the opinion of the management, all material adjustments necessary to fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
Results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for any subsequent interim period or a full year. Theses interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10 – K for the year ended December 31,2023 filed with SEC on April 01, 2024 (“2023 Form10-K”).

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN
Future issuances of the Company's equity or debt securities will be required for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a going concern. The Company's present revenues are marginally sufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial statement of the Company has been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $2,158,665 since its inception. There are no significant fixed recurring expenses and the current receivables are far in excess of current payables, thus management has no doubt that it will continue as a going concern and recover the expenses through trading activities that are in progress.
NOTE 3 – INCORPORATION OF SUBSIDIARY
In February 2015, the company incorporated a subsidiary, Promedaff, Inc. and purchased a skin care product line and formulations for $2,000,000 against a promissory note. An e commerce platform was set up for sales and marketing. The efforts did not bear any success and the entire inventory was sold through the Seller and the Promissory Note was cancelled and marked “VOID”. The name of this entity has been changed to Motors & Metals, Inc. In August 2018 Motors & Metals, Inc. received firm expression of interest from an overseas buyer willing to place long term purchase orders to buy 3,000 to 5,000 MT of Processed Scrap Metal. For over eight (8) months, the management scouted around to find a seller but learnt that no scrap metal processor was willing to entertain the business due to their loyalty agreements they have with their Buyer(s). Ultimately, the management decided to set up its own Scrap Metal Processing facility at the company owned 20 acre facility in King George, Virginia. Since the facility has been sold, thus this plan is no longer being pursued.
As reported in 10Qs for the earlier quarters, as well as in 10-K for the Annual reports, on February 4, 2016 the company incorporated another subsidiary in the State of Virginia under the name of JK Sales, Corp. (on December 7, 2017 the name was changed to Accurate Auto Parts, Inc.,) and has since remained in the business of buying end of life and salvage vehicles and selling auto parts.
On April 17, 2018 the company incorporated in Virginia, another subsidiary named Accurate Investments, Inc. the objectives of acquiring real estate property, which plan did not materialize. However, Accurate Investments, Inc. continues to pursue other investment opportunities that could add revenues to the Company.
On January 4, 2017 the company incorporated in Virginia another subsidiary named City Autos, Corp. with the objectives of operating an auto dealership and has finally commenced operations. Free Flow Auto Auction, an on-line auto auction platform is expected to be launched by the end of third quarter.
On December 22, 2020 the company through another subsidiary named FFLO – Inside Auto Parts, Inc. acquired the assets and business of an auto recycling entity located on a 16 acre facility in Mineral, Virginia. These assets through an amicable settlement, were resold to the seller in January 2022 due to reason that company failed to obtain to financing to redeem the promissory note given to the Seller.

Being a Smaller Company, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 
 
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEURES
Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control so as to
(1)  maintain the records  in reasonable detail, which will accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
(2) to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are  made  within the delegated authority ; and 
(3) to provide reasonable assurance for the  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on company’s financial statements. 
However, the management asserts that the company does not have any accounting staff due to limited financial resources though has plans to recruit gradually.  Also, this company does not have a well written document on accounting policies and procedures, though has plans to have them shortly.  Consequently, this can result in possible errors in the presentation and disclosure of financial information in our annual, quarterly, and other filings. 
The SIC Code of 1700 as showing in Edgar for this company is no longer valid, since this company is now dealing with the auto parts, as OEM Recycled Auto Parts. Segregation of duties is an important factor in Internal Control.  Though it is achieved to a certain extent, the management is committed to strengthen the internal controls effectively in the coming months.  
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended June 30, 2023, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
