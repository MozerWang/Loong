BREEZE HOLDINGS ACQUISITION CORP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

(Unaudited)



Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations



Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp. (the “Company") is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on June 11, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).



The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.



As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through March 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial Public Offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and from changes in the fair value of its warrant liability.



The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 23, 2020. On November 25, 2020, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000, which is described in Note 3.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,425,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Breeze Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) and I-Bankers Securities, Inc, generating gross proceeds of $5,425,000, which is described in Note 4.



Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 25, 2020, an amount of $115,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and $1,725,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 all funds in the trust account were in held in cash in an interest-bearing account.



Transaction costs incurred in connection with the Initial Public Offering amounted to $4,099,907, consisting of $2,300,000 of underwriting fees, $1,322,350 of representative share offering costs, and $477,557 of other offering costs. As of March 31, 2024, cash of $4,487 was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes.



The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete an initial Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).



                                                                   7





 

The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.15 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants.

 

The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased by it during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination.

 

If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 10% or more of the Public Shares, without the Company’s prior written consent.

 

The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by November 25, 2021 (which can be extended up to 6 months) and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the approved time period through June 26, 2024, (the "Combination Period").

 

On November 22, 2021, the Company announced that its sponsor, Breeze Sponsor, LLC, timely deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 (the “Extension Payment”), representing $0.10 per public share, into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. The Sponsor loaned the Extension Payment to the Company in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of the Extension Payment. The loan under the promissory note is non-interest bearing and will be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension.

 

On February 22, 2022, the Company announced that its sponsor, Breeze Sponsor, LLC, timely deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 (the “Second Extension Payment”), representing $0.10 per public share, into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. The Sponsor loaned the Second Extension Payment to the Company in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of the Second Extension Payment. The loan under the promissory note is non-interest bearing and will be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension.



                                                                   8





 

On May 5, 2022, the Company held a stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to September 26, 2022 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 6,732,987 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $69,700,628, (the “Redemption”). On May 10, 2022, $109,000 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes.

 

On September 13, 2022, the Company held its annual stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to March 26, 2023 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 3,076,817 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $31,845,056, and on September 8, 2022, $122,247 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes.



At the annual meeting of the Company held on September 13, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “A&R COI”) to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2022, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as March 26, 2023) by which the Company must (a) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination, which we refer to as our initial business combination, or (b) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and redeem all of the shares of common stock of the Company included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that was consummated on November 25, 2020, and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. The amended Trust Agreement  authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors to extend the time to complete the Business Combination up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (for a maximum of six one-month extensions), upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $0.035 for each outstanding public share by the Sponsor or its designees on or prior to September 26, 2022 or such other date as may be extended.  Breeze executed its first one-month extension of September 26, 2022 depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account.

 

On October 21, 2022, November 23, 2022, December 20, 2022, January 25, 2023 and February 23, 2023 Breeze executed the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth one-month extensions depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account for each monthly extension through March 26, 2023.   

 

The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on March 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. 



The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on September 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2023, up to nine (9) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as June 26, 2024), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. On September 27, 2023, October 25, 2023, November 27, 2023, December 27, 2023, January 26, 2024, February 27, 2024, March 26, 2024 and April 26, 2024 Breeze executed the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth one-month extensions through May 26, 2024.



                                                                   9





 

If the Company executes all nine (9) extensions, it will have until June 26, 2024 (unless the Company’s shareholders approve a proposal to amend the A&R COI to permit an extension of up to six additional one-month periods) to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. On May 3, 2024 the Company filed a 14/A Preliminary Proxy Statement calling for a Stockholder Meeting on June 21, 2024 to approve an extension to the time for the consummation of the business combination from June 26, 2024 to September 26, 2024.



In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $11.085 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and will not apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

On October 31, 2022, Breeze entered into the Original Merger Agreement, by and among Breeze, BH Velocity Merger Sub, Inc. (“Company Merger Sub”), and TV Ammo, Inc., an advanced technology manufacturing and licensing company focused on revolutionizing the global ammunition and weapons industry through the introduction of its composite-cased ammunition, innovative weapons systems and advanced manufacturing technology (“TV Ammo”). On February 14, 2024, Breeze entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “A&R Merger Agreement”), by and among Breeze, True Velocity, Inc. ("True Velocity"), Breeze Merger Sub, Inc. ("Parent Merger Sub"), Company Merger Sub, and TV Ammo, which amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement in its entirety.



On February 14, 2024 Breeze filed an S-4 with the SEC regarding a merger with TV Ammo, which included a preliminary proxy statement and a prospectus in connection with the A&R Merger Agreement. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of True Velocity, Breeze and TV Ammo. 

  

The A&R Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the boards of directors of each of Breeze, True Velocity, Parent Merger Sub, Company Merger Sub, and TV Ammo.



Pursuant to and in accordance with the terms set forth in the A&R Merger Agreement, (a) Parent Merger Sub will merge with and into Breeze, with Breeze continuing as the surviving entity (the “Parent Merger”), as a result of which, (i) Breeze will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of True Velocity, and (ii) each issued and outstanding security of Breeze immediately prior to the effective time of the Parent Merger (the “Parent Merger Effective Time”) (other than shares of Breeze Common Stock that have been redeemed or are owned by Breeze or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as treasury shares and any Dissenting Parent Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled in exchange for the issuance to the holder thereof of a substantially equivalent security of True Velocity (other than the Breeze Rights, which shall be automatically converted into shares of True Velocity), and, (b) immediately following the consummation of the Parent Merger but on the same day, Company Merger Sub will merge with and into TV Ammo, with TV Ammo continuing as the surviving entity (the “Company Merger” and, together with the Parent Merger, the “Mergers”), as a result of which, (i) TV Ammo will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of True Velocity, and (ii) each issued and outstanding security of TV Ammo immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (the “Company Merger Effective Time”) (other than any Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled in exchange for the issuance to the holder thereof of a substantially equivalent security of True Velocity. The Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the A&R Merger Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.”



                                                                   10







Following the Mergers, True Velocity will seek to become a publicly traded entity listed on Nasdaq. In connection with the formation of Breeze Merger Sub on February 13, 2024, True Velocity acquired 1,000 shares of common stock of Breeze Merger Sub for $1.00. On February 13, 2024 Breeze bought 1,000 shares of True Velocity, Inc. for $0.10.

 

The Business Combination is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfaction of the minimum available cash condition, the receipt of certain governmental approvals and the required approval by the stockholders of Breeze and TV Ammo. 



The parties have agreed to take actions such that, effective immediately after the Closing of the Business Combination, True Velocity’s board of directors shall consist of seven directors, consisting of two Breeze designees (at least one of whom shall be an “independent director”), four TV Ammo designees (at least three of whom shall be “independent directors”) and the chief executive officer of True Velocity. True Velocity’s executive management team will be led by the current management of TV Ammo. To qualify as an “independent director” under the A&R Merger Agreement, a designee shall both (a) qualify as “independent” under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and (b) not have had any business relationship with either Breeze or TV Ammo or any of their respective subsidiaries, including as an officer or director thereof, other than for a period of less than six months prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.

 

The A&R Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, including, but not limited to, (i) by mutual written consent of Breeze and TV Ammo, (ii) by Breeze, on the one hand, or TV Ammo, on the other hand, if there is any breach of the representations, warranties, covenant or agreement of the other party as set forth in the A&R Merger Agreement, in each case, such that certain conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and the breach or breaches of such representations or warranties or the failure to perform such covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured or cannot be cured within certain specified time periods, (iii) by either Breeze or TV Ammo if the Business Combination is not consummated by March 15, 2024 upon written election by either party, (iv) by either Breeze or TV Ammo if a meeting of Breeze’s stockholders is held to vote on proposals relating to the Business Combination and the stockholders do not approve the proposals, and (v) by Breeze if the TV Ammo stockholders do not approve the A&R Merger Agreement. 

 

Going Concern

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $4,487 in cash held outside of the Trust Account and negative working capital of $8,985,992, excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable.

 

The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through proceeds of $25,000 from the sale of the Founder Shares, and a loan of $300,000 under an unsecured and non-interest bearing promissory note (see Note 5). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s liquidity needs have been satisfied from the net proceeds from the private placement held outside of the Trust Account.



On November 27, 2023, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities (shares, warrants, and rights) would be subject to suspension and delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on December 6, 2023 due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. The Company requested a hearing before the Panel to request additional time to complete its business combination. The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing which was held on February 27, 2024. On March 15, 2024, the Company received the Panel’s determination granting the Company an exception until May 28, 2024 to complete its initial business combination. In the event the Business Combination is not closed by May 28, 2024, the Company's common stock, rights and warrants will trade over-the-counter until such time as the Business Combination is completed.

 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through a business combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to consummate a business combination or obtain Working Capital Loans will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

                                                                   11







We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 



The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company's business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company's cash and working capital as of March 31, 2024 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. These conditions raise a substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



Risks and uncertainties

 

With rising tensions around the world based on the current conflict between Israel and Hamas and the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia, we may be unable to complete a business combination if concerns related to this and other potential conflicts impact global capital markets, the ability to transfer money, currency exchange rates, cyber attacks and infrastructure including power generation and transmission, communications, and travel. Escalating conflicts could also have an impact on global demands for health care, international trade including vendor supply chains, and energy. In addition, there have been recent threats to infrastructure and equipment including cyber attacks, physical facility destruction and equipment destruction. The outcome of these conflicts or their impact cannot be predicted and may have an adverse impact in a material way on our ability to consummate a business combination, or to operate a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination.

 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) was signed into law, which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by a domestic corporation beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions. Because the Company is a Delaware corporation and its securities trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Company is a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the Inflation Reduction Act, and while not free from doubt, it is possible that the excise tax will apply to any redemptions of its common stock after December 31, 2022, including redemptions in connection with an initial Business Combination and any amendment to its certificate of incorporation to extend the time to consummate an initial Business Combination, unless an exemption is available. Consequently, the value of an investment in the Company’s securities may decrease as a result of the excise tax. In addition, the excise tax may make a transaction with the Company less appealing to potential Business Combination targets, and thus, potentially hinder the Company’s ability to enter into and consummate an initial Business Combination. Further, the application of the excise tax in the event of a liquidation is uncertain absent further guidance.

 

On March 29, 2023, the Company redeemed 509,712 shares of its common stock subject to redemption at $10.56 per share for $5.4 million. On September 26, 2023, the Company redeemed 21,208 shares of its common stock subject to redemption at $10.77 per share for approximately $231,000. Management evaluated the classification of the stock redemption under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450, “Contingencies”. ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists the likelihood that the future event(s) will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote.  A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. Management determined that it should recognize a 1% excise tax on the redemption amount paid. As of March 31, 2024, the Company recorded $56,270 of excise tax liability calculated as 1% of shares redeemed on March 29, 2023 and September 26, 2023. Any reduction to this liability resulting from either a subsequent stock issuance or an event giving rise to an exception that occurs within this tax year, will be recognized in the period (including an interim period) that such stock issuance or event giving rise to an exception occurs.

 

We may maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance limit. The FDIC took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank and New York Signature Bank on March 10, 2023 and March 12, 2023, respectively. The Company does not have any direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank or New York Signature Bank. However, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.



The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024. The financial information as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the period ended December 31, 2023. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the period ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.



Emerging growth company

The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 

This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

 

Principles of Consolidation



The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned and controlled operating subsidiaries, True Velocity, Parent Merger Sub, and Company Merger Sub, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 



Use of estimates



The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.



Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.



                                                                   13







Cash and cash equivalents

 

The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Cash held in Trust Account

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held as cash in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account.



Common stock subject to possible redemption

 

All of the 11,500,000 shares of common stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Accounting Standards Classification ("ASC") 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to possible redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all of the shares of common stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public offering have been classified outside of permanent equity.

 

On September 13, 2022, the Company held its annual stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to March 26, 2023 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 3,076,817 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed. The 1,690,196 shares of common stock remaining from the Initial Public Offering were classified outside of permanent equity at that time.

On September 22, 2023, the Company held a stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to June 26, 2024 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.77 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 21,208 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed. The 1,159,276 shares of common stock remaining from the Initial Public Offering have been classified outside of permanent equity at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.



The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are recorded as charges to additional paid-in capital and, if necessary, accumulated deficit.

Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are recorded as charges to additional paid-in capital and, if necessary, accumulated deficit. Stockholders who elect to redeem their shares do so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, and also receive any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses).

 

As of March 31, 2024 the common stock reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:

 

Common stock subject to possible redemption – December 31, 2023                                                     $      12,647,701 

                                                                                                                                      

Plus:

                                                                   14







Warrant Liabilities



The Company evaluated the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants (collectively, “Warrants”, see Note 7) in accordance with ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Initial Public Offering) and at each reporting date thereafter in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement” (“ASC 820”), with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the period of change.



Income taxes



The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.



ASC 740-270 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement’s recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.



Net loss per share



Net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other shareholders, redeemable and non-redeemable shares of common stock are presented as one class of shares in calculating net loss per share of common stock. As a result, the calculated net loss per share is the same for redeemable and non-redeemable shares of common stock. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented.



                                                                   15







The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share (in dollars, except per share amounts):

Concentration of credit risk



Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.



Fair value of financial instruments



The Company applies ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Company’s principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions based on market data and the entity’s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.



The carrying amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for cash, prepaid expenses and accrued offering costs approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

 

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

 

Level 1 – Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level 2 – Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

 

Level 3 – Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities.



See Note 9 for additional information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

 

                                                                   16







Recent accounting pronouncements

 

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, “Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)” (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. The ASU allows the use of the modified retrospective method or the fully retrospective method. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2023. There was no effect from such adoption to the financial statements.



On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience and to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. The final rules became effective 30 days following publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register. The Form 10-K and Form 20-F disclosures will be due beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023. The Company developed its processes and procedures needed for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as the material effects or reasonably likely material effects of risks from cybersecurity threats and previous cybersecurity incidents. This includes describing the board of directors’ oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB or Board) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). The ASU focuses on income tax disclosures around effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (generally, calendar year 2025) and effective for all other business entities one year later. Entities should adopt this guidance on a prospective basis, though retrospective application is permitted. The Company’s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its financial statement disclosures.

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 

Note 3 — Initial Public Offering



Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 10,000,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit on November 23, 2020, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value, one Right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). In connection with the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option on November 25, 2020, the Company sold an additional 1,500,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7). Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and will expire five years after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. However, if the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination on or prior to June 26, 2024, assuming all remaining one-month extensions are utilized, the Warrants will expire worthless at the end of such period.



Note 4 — Private Placement



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor and I-Bankers purchased an aggregate of 5,425,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,425,000. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, certain of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.



                                                                   17







Note 5 — Related Party Transactions

 

Founder Shares

 

In June 2020, the Sponsor purchased 100 shares of common stock (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On July 15, 2020, the Sponsor effected a 28,750-for-1 forward stock split and, as a result, our initial shareholders held 2,875,000 Founder Shares as of the date of our initial public offering.

 

The 2,875,000 Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 375,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Sponsor does not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 375,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Founder Shares will automatically convert into shares of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments, as described in Note 6.

 

The Sponsor and each holder of Founder Shares have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.

 

The Company had agreed with each of its four independent directors (the “Directors”) subsequent to incorporation of the Company to provide them the right to each purchase 25,000 Founder Shares with a par value of $0.0001 of the Company from Breeze Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”). The Directors each exercised their right in full on July 6, 2021 and purchased 100,000 shares (25,000 per each Director) of the Founder Shares from Sponsor for a total of $10 in the aggregate. Sponsor has agreed to transfer 15,000 shares of its common stock to each of the Directors upon the closing of a Business Combination by the Company, with such shares currently beneficially owned by Sponsor.

 

The sale or allocation of the Founder Shares to the Company’s Directors, as described above, is within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718 stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The fair value of the 100,000 shares purchased by the Company’s Directors was $401,000 or $4.01 per share. The compensation expense related to these share purchases was recorded in full on the grant date of July 6, 2021 for a total of $401,000. 

 

Administrative Support Agreement

 

The Company entered into an agreement whereby, commencing on November 23, 2020 through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, the Company will pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred and paid $15,000 in fees for these services. For the year ending December 31, 2023 the Company incurred $60,000 in fees for these services of which such amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 

Related Party Loans

   

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,000,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. However, all working capital promissory notes specifically state that the Sponsor has elected not to convert. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loan.



                                                                   18





 

On February 1, 2022 (as amended), the Company signed a Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of March 26, 2023, for a total of up to $1,500,000. On October 1, 2022, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to $4,000,000. On April 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to $5,000,000. On October 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to $6,000,000. On March 1, 2024, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to $7,000,000. As of March 31, 2024, the amount outstanding under this Promissory Note was $5,242,109 for direct working capital, and $845,549 for monthly SPAC extension funds the Sponsor deposited into the Trust Account during the months of September 2022 through March 2024 for a total of $6,087,658 from Sponsor. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) June 26, 2024. The Company additionally owes the Sponsor $196,717 for expenses paid by Sponsor on behalf of the Company. The total amount owed to the Sponsor as of March 31, 2024 is $8,584,375. 

 

The Company had 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate its initial Business Combination. However, by resolution of its board, requested by the Sponsor, the Company extended the period of time to consummate a Business Combination two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination). The Sponsor deposited additional funds into the Trust Account in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate its initial Business Combination. The Sponsor deposited into the Trust Account for each three-month extension, $1,150,000 ($0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline.  On September 13, 2022, the Company held its annual stockholders’ meeting and approved the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2022, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as March 26, 2023). For each one-month extension on September 26, October 26, November 26, December 26, 2022, January 25, 2023 and February 23, 2023 $59,157 ($0.035 per share) per extension, up to an aggregate of $354,942, or approximately $0.21 per share. The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on March 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023).  For each one-month extension through September 26, 2023, the Sponsor deposited into the Trust Account $41,317 ($0.035 per share) on March 30, 2023. April 25, 2023, May 25, 2023, June 26, 2023, August 2, 2023 and August 28, 2023. The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on September 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2023, up to nine (9) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as June 26, 2024), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. For each one-month extension the Company will deposit $40,575 ($0.035 per share) into the Trust Account. On September 27, 2023, Breeze executed the thirteenth one-month extension through October 26, 2023. On October 24, 2023, November 26, 2023, December 27, 2023, January 26, 2024, February 27, 2024, March 26, 2024 and April 26, 2024 Breeze executed the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth one-month extension through May 26, 2024. The payments were made in the form of a loan. The loans are non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, it will repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to it. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, it will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter agreement with the Company’s initial stockholders contains a provision pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loans out of the funds held in the Trust Account in the event that the Company does not complete a Business Combination.

 

Representative and Consultant Shares

 

Pursuant to the underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) between the Company and I-Bankers Securities (the “Representative”), on November 23, 2020, the Company issued to the Representative and its designee 250,000 shares of common stock and separately agreed to issue the Company’s Consultant 15,000 shares of common stock for nominal consideration in a private placement intended to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Act. In August 2021, the Company issued to the Consultant such Consultant Shares. The Company accounted for the Representative Shares and Consultant Shares as a deferred offering cost of the Initial Public Offering. Accordingly, the offering cost was allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs allocated to the Warrants were expensed immediately in the statement of operations, while offering costs allocated to the redeemable Public Shares were deferred and subsequently charged to temporary stockholders' equity following the completion of the Initial Public Offering.



In 2020, the Company estimated and recorded the fair value of the Representative Shares and Consultant Shares to be $1,322,350 based upon the price of the common stock issued ($4.99 per share) to the Representative and Consultant. The holders of the Representative Shares and Consultant Shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the later of (i) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and 180 days pursuant to FINRA Conduct Rule 5110(e)(1) following the effective date of the Registration Statement to anyone other than (i) the Representative or an underwriter or selected dealer in connection with the Offering, or (ii) a bona fide officer or partner of the Representative or of any such underwriter or selected dealer. Additionally, pursuant to FINRA Conduct Rule 5110(e), the Representative Shares and Consultant Shares will not be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

In addition, the holders of Representative Shares and Consultant Shares have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the time specified in the certificate of incorporation.

  

                                                                   19





 

Note 6 — Commitments



Registration and Stockholder Rights



Pursuant to a registration rights and stockholder agreement entered into on November 23, 2020, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of  common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration and stockholder rights requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Company’s common stock). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. In the case of the private placement warrants and representative shares issued to I-Bankers Securities, the demand registration rights provided will not be exercisable for longer than five years from the effective date of the registration statement in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8)(C) and the piggyback registration right provided will not be exercisable for longer than seven years from the effective date of the registration statement in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8)(D). The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.



Underwriting Agreement

 

The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On November 25, 2020, the underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit.

 

Business Combination Marketing Agreement



The Company has engaged I-Bankers Securities, Inc. on November 23, 2020, as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing the Company’s securities in connection with a Business Combination, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay I-Bankers Securities, Inc. a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 2.75% of the gross proceeds of Initial Public Offering, or $3,162,500.



Merger Proxy/Business Combination Rate Agreement

 

On December 2, 2022, the Company signed a Merger Proxy/Business Combination Rate Agreement with Edgar Agents LLC, for SEC document preparation, printing and filing for the merger with TV Ammo. The agreement includes an obligation to pay a Transaction Success Fee of $50,000 upon successful completion and filing of the documents with the SEC. 

 

Proxy Solicitation Services Agreement

 

On January 31, 2022, the Company signed a Proxy Solicitation Services Agreement with D.F. King & Co., Inc., for proxy solicitation services associated with the business combination with TV Ammo. The agreement includes an obligation to pay a Service Fee of $25,000 and a discretionary fee, if warranted, at the sole discretion of the Company upon completion of the proxy solicitation services.

 

Public Relations Agreement

 

On February 29, 2024, the Company signed a Public Relations Agreement with Gateway Group, Inc., for public relations services for the business combination with TV Ammo. The agreement includes an obligation to pay a Transaction Success Fee of $20,000 upon the successful completion of the business combination with TV Ammo.



                                                                   20





Note 7 – Warrants

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 11,500,000 Public Warrants and 5,425,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. The Company classifies the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as warrant liabilities on the balance sheet in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the warrant holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the acceptance by the holders of the Company’s common stock of a tender, exchange or redemption offer. Upon such a qualifying tender cash offer (an event which could be outside the control of the Company), all Warrant holders would be entitled to cash.  This factor precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the warrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that is greater than a holder of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability accounting is required. As such, these warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as “Change in fair value of warrant liability” until the warrants are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders’ equity. The Company utilized a Modified Black Scholes Model to estimate the fair values of the warrants, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value by using the below key inputs to the Modified Black Scholes Model.



Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares are issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants are exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.



The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable for cash, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.



                                                                   21





 

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, it will use our reasonable best efforts to file, and within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, to have declared effective, a registration statement relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if our common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the company so elect, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its best efforts to qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.



Once the warrants become exercisable, the company may call the warrants for redemption:



•    in whole and not in part; 



•    at a price of $0.01 per warrant;



•    upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and



•    if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days

      within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to the notice of redemption to the

      warrant

      holders.

 

The Company may not redeem the warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants.



In addition, if (x) the company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our initial stockholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (the “Newly Issued Price”) (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day after the day on which the company consummates its initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.



The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to the company, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of common stock. After the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.



No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of common stock to be issued to the warrant holder.

                                                                   22





 

The Private Placement Warrants (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and they will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the original holders or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the original holders or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Warrants included in the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are substantially identical to those of the Warrants being sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering.



The Sponsor and I-Bankers Securities purchased from the Company an aggregate of 5,425,000 Warrants at a price of $ 1.00 per Warrant (a purchase price of $ 5,425,000) in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of the Initial Public Offering (the “Private Placement Warrants”). Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50. The purchase price of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account pending completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination. 



If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, then the proceeds will be part of the liquidating distributions to the public stockholders and the Warrants issued to the Sponsor and I-Bankers Securities will expire worthless.



The warrant liabilities were initially measured at fair value upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and subsequently re-measured at each reporting period using a Modified Black-Scholes model. The Public Warrants were allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value. The Company recognized a loss in connection with changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities of $21,132,500 and a gain of $169,250 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.



Note 8 — Stockholder’s Deficit

 

Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

 

Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 3,140,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding for both periods, excluding 1,159,276 and 1,159,276 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively.

 

Rights — Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a Right will automatically receive one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination, even if the holder of a Right converted all shares held by him, her or it in connection with the Business Combination or an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation with respect to its pre-business combination activities. In the event that the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of the Business Combination, each holder of a Right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its Rights in order to receive the one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of common stock underlying each Right upon consummation of the Business Combination. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of Rights in order to receive his, her or its additional share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination. The shares issuable upon exchange of the Rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of Rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of shares of common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis.



                                                                   23





 

The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of Rights. As a result, the holders of the Rights must hold Rights in multiples of 20 in order to receive shares for all of the holders’ Rights upon closing of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Rights.



Note 9 — Fair Value Measurements

The following table presents information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:

 

Description                                                                            Level 1          Level 2          Level 3     

                                                                                                                                     

Liabilities

The following table presents information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:

 

Description                                                                            Level 1          Level 2          Level 3     

                                                                                                                                     

Liabilities                                                                                                                        

Warrant liability - Public Warrants                                                $    1,495,000  $             —  $            — 

Warrant liability - Private Placement Warrants                                     $            —  $             —  $      705,250 



The Company utilized a back-solve lattice model for the initial valuation of the Public Warrants. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker BREZW. The quoted prices of the Public Warrants were $1.26 and $0.13 per warrant as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

  

The Company utilizes a Modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement warrant liability is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The probability of completing the business combination is derived by taking a sample of other special purpose acquisition companies and calculating the implied probability of completion for each company in the sample set. The average and 1st and 3rd quartiles of the implied probability of completion then formulates the basis for the probability utilized for the Company in the models. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.

 

The aforementioned warrant liabilities are not subject to qualified hedge accounting.



Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.



                                                                   24

Note 10 — Interim Income Tax

  

The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was -0.03% and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was -0.26% respectively. The Company's effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate of 21.00% primarily due to the recognition of gains or losses from the change in the fair value of warrants, non-deductible transaction costs, and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company believes that, at this time, the use of the discrete method for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is more appropriate than the estimated annual effective tax rate method as the estimated annual effective tax rate method is not reliable due to a high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax earnings.



Note 11 — Subsequent Events



The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not, except as described in these consolidated financial statements and below, identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.



                                                                   25

Overview

 

We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 11, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

 

As indicated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $4,487 and $4,228 in cash, respectively, and a working capital deficit of $8,985,992 and $7,849,292, respectively (excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable). We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful.



Results of Operations

 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from June 11, 2020 (inception) through March 31, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account, and changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.



For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $22,015,739, which consisted of a loss of $21,132,500 in the fair value of warrant liabilities and operating costs of $1,047,041, offset by interest income of $169,580 on our Trust Account.



For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $654,261, which consisted of operating costs of $890,129, offset by a gain of $169,250 in the fair value of warrant liabilities and interest income of $68,327 on our Trust Account.



                                                                   26





 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

On November 25, 2020, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (including 1,500,000 units from the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option), generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,425,000 private placement warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,425,000.

 

Following the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $116,725,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $4,099,907 in transaction costs, including $2,300,000 of underwriting fees, $1,322,350 of representative share offering costs, and $477,557 of other offering costs.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash held in an interest-bearing trust account of $13,268,833. On May 5, 2022, the Company held a stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to September 26, 2022 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 6,732,987 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $69,700,628, (the “Redemption”). On May 10, 2022, $109,000 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes.

 

On September 13, 2022, the Company held its annual stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to March 26, 2023 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 3,076,817 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $31,845,056 with 1,690,196 shares remaining. On September 8, 2022, $122,247 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes.

 

At the annual meeting of the Company held on September 13, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “A&R COI”) to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2022, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as March 26, 2023) by which the Company must (a) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination, which we refer to as our initial business combination, or (b) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and redeem all of the shares of common stock of the Company included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that was consummated on November 25, 2020, and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. The amended Trust Agreement  authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors to extend the time to complete the Business Combination up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (for a maximum of six one-month extensions), upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $0.035 for each outstanding public share by the Sponsor or its designees on or prior to September 26, 2022 or such other date as may be extended.  Breeze executed its first one-month extension of September 26, 2022 depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account. On October 21, November 23, and December 20, 2022, January 25, 2023 and February 23, 2023 Breeze executed the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth one-month extensions through March 26, 2023.

The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on March 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. On March 29, 2023, Breeze executed the seventh one-month extension through April 26, 2023.  On April 25, 2023, May 25, 2023, and June 26, 2023 Breeze executed the eighth, ninth and tenth one-month extensions through July 26, 2023. On August 3, 2023 and August 28, 2023, Breeze executed the eleventh and twelfth one-month extensions through September 26, 2023.







The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on September 22, 2023 where the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2023, up to nine (9) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as June 26, 2024), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. On September 27, 2023 Breeze executed the thirteenth one-month extension through October 26, 2023. On October 25, 2023, November 27, 2023, December 27, 2023, January 26, 2024, February 27, 2024, March 26, 2024 and April 26, 2024 Breeze executed the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth one-month extensions through May 26, 2024. On September 27, 2023 $206,650 was withdrawn of interest income from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes. 

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash held in the trust account of $13,268,833, including $169,580 of interest. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. On May 10, 2022, $109,000 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes, on September 8, 2022, $122,247 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes, and on September 27, 2023, $209,650 was withdrawn of interest income from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $629,741 which was due to a net loss of $22,015,739, a non-cash decrease in fair value of warrant liabilities of $21,132,500, interest income of $169,580 on the Trust Account, and a decrease in working capital of $423,078. For the same period cash provided by investing activities was $121,724 which was due to an investment of cash in the Trust Account of $121,724, and net cash provided by financing activities was $751,724 which was due to proceeds from working capital loans and a promissory note from Sponsor of $630,000 and $121,724, respectively.



For the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $586,560 which was due to net loss of $654,261, primarily offset by a non-cash increase in fair value of warrant liabilities of $169,250, interest of $68,327 on the Trust Account, and a decrease in working capital of $305,278. For the same period cash provided by investing activities was $5,222,928 which was due to investment in the Trust Account of $173,001, a redemption of common stock of $5,395,929, and net cash used in financing activities was $4,612,928 which was due to proceeds from a related party working capital loan of $610,000 and proceeds from a related party promissory note of $173,001 and, a redemption of common stock of $5,395,929.

 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $4,487 and $4,228, respectively, in cash held outside the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of $8,985,992 and $7,849,292, respectively (excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable).

 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. However, all working capital promissory notes specifically state that the Sponsor has elected not to covert. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

 

                                                                   27





On November 19, 2021, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) June 26, 2024.

 

On February 1, 2022, the Company signed a Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of March 26, 2023, for a total of up to $1,500,000. On October 1, 2022, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to $4,000,000. On April 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to $5,000,000. On October 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to $6,000,000. On March 1, 2024, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to $7,000,000. As of March 31, 2024, the amount outstanding under this working capital loan was $5,242,109 for direct working capital, and $845,549 for monthly SPAC extension funds for the months of September 2022 through March 2024 for a total of $6,087,658 from Sponsor. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) June 26, 2024.

 

On February 18, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) June 26, 2024.

  

Going Concern



We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.

 

Based upon the above narrative, Management determined that the above conditions and/or events indicate that it may be probable that the Company would be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.  Although Management plans to address this uncertainty through a Business Combination or through obtaining Working Capital Loans, there is no assurance that the Company’s plans to consummate the Business Combination or obtain the Working Capital Loans will be successful.

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company’s cash and working capital as of March 31, 2024 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The agreement includes an obligation to pay a Transaction Success Fee of $20,000 upon the successful completion of the business combination with TV Ammo.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, judgements and the related policies that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below

Warrant Liabilities

In determining the fair value of the Company’s Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants our third party valuation firm uses the most observable inputs available. The valuation approach for our Public Warrants utilizes a back-solve lattice model and for our Private Placement Warrants uses a Modified Black-Scholes model. Some of the inputs used in the models include the dividend yield on the Company’s common stock, expected common stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected business combination date and probability of completing the business combination. Several of these inputs are known and several use judgements. For instance, the probability of completing the business combination is derived by taking a sample of other special purpose acquisition companies and calculating the implied probability of completion for each company in the sample set. The average and 1st and 3rd quartiles of the implied probability of completion then formulates the basis for the probability utilized for the Company in the models. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between these assumptions, impact the Company’s valuation of its Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of these warrants.

Recent Accounting Standards

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.



Item 4. Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024, because of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.



During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that it failed to accurately prepare its income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023. The control deficiencies related to the preparation, reviews and accounting of the Company's income tax provision and related expense represents a material weakness related to financial reporting.

 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



Except as set forth above, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



                                                                   30
