Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements depend upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of our control. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our expectations concerning the outlook for our business, productivity, plans and goals for future operational improvements and capital investments, operational performance, future market conditions or economic performance and developments in the capital and credit markets and expected future financial performance, as well as any information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations.

 

Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results or events may differ materially from those projected or implied in those statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    the sufficiency of our cash and investments to meet our liquidity needs;

           

     ●    our limited operating history and uncertain future prospects and rate of growth due to our limited operating history,

           including our ability to implement business plans and other

           expectations;

           

     ●    our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter;

           

     ●    our ability to maintain and grow the strength of our brand reputation;

           

     ●    the Company’s ability to achieve its objectives;

           

     ●    our ability to manage our growth effectively;

           

     ●    our ability to retain existing and attract new Esports professionals, content creators and influencers;

           

     ●    our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, directors and other key employees or

           independent

           contractors;

           

     ●    our ability to maintain and strengthen our community of brand partners, engaged consumers, content creators, influencers and

           Esports professionals, and the success of our strategic relationships with these and other third

           parties;

           

     ●    our ability to effectively compete within the industry;

           

     ●    our presence on the internet and various third-party mass media platforms;

           

     ●    risks related to data security and privacy, including the risk of cyber-attacks or other security incidents;

           

     ●    risks resulting from our global operations;

           

     ●    our ability to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq;

           

     ●    our securities’ potential liquidity and trading, including that the price of our securities may be volatile;

           

     ●    future issuances, sales or resales of our securities;

           

     ●    the grant and future exercise of registration rights;

 

                                                                                                                                        



                                                                    

 

     ●    our ability to secure future financing, if needed, and our ability to repay any future indebtedness when due;

           

     ●    the ability of the Company to complete offerings on acceptable terms;

           

     ●    the impact of the regulatory environment in our industry and complexities with compliance related to such environment,

           including our ability to comply with complex regulatory

           requirements;

           

     ●    our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting;

           

     ●    our ability to respond to general economic conditions, including market interest rates;

           

     ●    our ability to execute on future acquisitions, mergers or dispositions; and

           

     ●    changes to accounting principles and guidelines.

 

We caution you not to rely on forward-looking statements, which reflect current beliefs and are based on information currently available as of the date a forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements set forth herein speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Other sections of this report describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.

 

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. In the event that any forward-looking statement is updated, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to that statement, related matters, or any other forward-looking statements except to the extent required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. Any corrections or revisions and other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements may appear in our public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which are or will be (as appropriate) accessible at www.sec.gov, and which you are advised to consult.

GAMESQUARE HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

 

1. Corporate information and going concern

 

(a) Corporate information

 

GameSquare Holdings, Inc. (“GameSquare” or the “Company”) is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delawre as of March 7, 2024 (and was a corporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Province of British Columbia) prior to March 7, 2023). The registered head office of the Company is 6775 Cowboys Way, Ste. 1335, Frisco, Texas, USA, 75034.

 

GameSquare, completed its Plan of Merger (the “Merger”) with FaZe Holdings, Inc. (“FaZe”) on March 7, 2024, resulting in the Company acquiring all the issued and outstanding securities of FaZe (see Note 4).

 

GameSquare is a vertically integrated, digital media, entertainment and technology company that connects global brands with gaming and youth culture audiences. GameSquare’s end-to-end platform includes Gaming Community Network (“GCN”), a digital media company focused on gaming and esports audiences, Swingman LLC dba as Zoned, a gaming and lifestyle marketing agency, Code Red Esports Ltd. (“Code Red”), a UK based esports talent agency, FaZe Holdings Inc. (“FaZe”), a lifestyle and media platform rooted in gaming and youth culture whose premium brand, talent network, and large audience can be monetized across a variety of products and services, GSQ dba as Fourth Frame Studios, a creative production studio, Mission Supply, a merchandise and consumer products business, Frankly Media, programmatic advertising, Stream Hatchet, live streaming analytics, and Sideqik a social influencer marketing platform.

 

(b) Going concern

 

These accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, they do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, and therefore be required to realize its assets and liquidate its liabilities and commitments in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Such adjustments could be material. It is not possible to predict whether the Company will be able to raise adequate financing or ultimately attain profit levels of operations.

 

The Company has not yet realized profitable operations and has incurred significant losses to date resulting in an accumulated deficit of $78.7 million as of March 31, 2024 ($73.4 million as of December 31, 2023). The recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and the Company’s continued existence is dependent upon the achievement of profitable operations, or the ability of the Company to raise alternative financing, if necessary. While management has been historically successful in raising the necessary capital, it cannot provide assurance that it will be able to execute its business strategy or be successful in future financing activities. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $14.8 million (as of December 31, 2023, a working capital deficiency of $13.9 million) which is comprised of current assets less current liabilities.

 

These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

 

                                                                   6

 

 

2. Significant accounting policies

 

(a) Basis of presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. In management’s opinion, the interim information contains all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The footnote disclosures related to the interim financial information contained herein are also unaudited. Such financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, and amended on April 30, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).

 

(b) Principles of consolidation

 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling voting interest and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in affiliates where the Company does not exert a controlling financial interest are not consolidated.

 

All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

(c) Use of estimates

 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) valuation of warrant liabilities; (ii) valuation of convertible debt; (iii) contingent liabilities; (iv) share-based compensation; (v) assumptions used in business combinations; and (vi) testing for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements.

 

                                                                   7

 

 

(d) Revenue recognition

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of its services to a customer.

 

There were no significant changes in the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customer and related revenue recognition policies for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The following describes the revenue recognition policies for the revenue streams the Company acquired as a result of the Merger (see Note 4):

 

Brand Sponsorships

 

The Company offers advertisers a full range of promotional vehicles, including but not limited to online advertising, livestream announcements, event content generation, social media posts, logo placement on the Company’s official merchandise, and special appearances of members of the Company’s talent roster. The Company’s brand sponsorship agreements may include multiple services that are capable of being individually distinct; however the intended benefit is an association with the Company’s brand, and the services are not distinct within the context of the contracts. Revenues from brand sponsorship agreements are recognized ratably over the contract term. Payment terms and conditions vary, but payments are generally due periodically throughout the term of the contract. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of billing, management has determined the brand sponsorship agreements generally do not include a significant financing component.

 

Content

 

The Company and its talent roster generate and produce original content which the Company monetizes through Google’s AdSense service. Revenue is variable and is earned when the visitor views or “clicks through” on the advertisement. The amount of revenue earned is reported to the Company monthly and is recognized upon receipt of the report of viewership activity. Payment terms and conditions vary, but payments are generally due within 30 to 45 days after the end of each month.

 

The Company grants exclusive licenses to customers for certain content produced by the Company’s talent. The Company grants the customer a license to the intellectual property, which is the content and its use in generating advertising revenues, for a pre-determined period, for an amount paid by the customer, in most instances, upon execution of the contract. The Company’s only performance obligation is to license the content for use in generating advertising revenues, and the Company recognizes the full contract amount at the point at which the Company provides the customer access to the content, which is at the execution of the contract. The Company has no further performance obligations under these types of contracts and does not anticipate generating any additional revenue from these arrangements apart from the contract amount.

 

Consumer Products

 

The Company earns consumer products revenue from sales of the Company’s consumer products on the Company’s website or at live or virtual events. Revenues are recognized at a point in time, as control is transferred to the customer upon shipment. The Company offers customer returns and discounts through a third-party distributor and accounts for this as a reduction to revenue. The Company does not offer loyalty programs or other sales incentive programs that are material to revenue recognition. Payment is due at the time of sale. The Company has outsourced the design, manufacturing, fulfillment, distribution, and sale of the Company’s consumer products to a third party in exchange for royalties based on the amount of revenue generated. Management evaluated the terms of the agreement to determine whether the Company’s consumer products revenues should be reported gross or net of royalties paid. Key indicators that management evaluated in determining whether the Company is the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    the Company is the party that is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service,

     ●    the Company has inventory risk before the good is transferred to the customer, and

     ●    the Company is the party that has discretion in establishing pricing for the specified good or service.

 

                                                                   8

 

 

Based on management’s evaluation of the above indicators, the Company reports consumer products revenues on a gross basis.

 

Esports

 

League Participation: Generally, The Company has one performance obligation—to participate in the overall Esport event—because the underlying activities do not have standalone value absent the Company’s participation in the tournament or event. Revenue from prize winnings and profit-share agreements is variable and is highly uncertain. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when the uncertainty is resolved.

 

Player Transfer Fees: Player transfer agreements include a fixed fee and may include a variable fee component. The Company recognizes the fixed portion of revenue from transfer fees upon satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation, which coincides with the execution of the related agreement. The variable portion of revenue is considered highly uncertain and is recognized at the point in time when the uncertainty is resolved.

 

Licensing of Intellectual Property: The Company’s licenses of intellectual property generate royalties that are recognized in accordance with the royalty recognition constraint. That is, royalty revenue is recognized at the time when the sale occurs.

 

The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue recognized is the net amount of commission made by the Company.

 

Deferred revenue consists of customer advances for Company services to be rendered that will be recognized as income in future periods.

 

(e) Cash and restricted cash

 

The Company maintains cash deposits with major banks, financial institutions, and other custodians. Deposits at each financial institution are insured in limited amounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). At times cash balances held at financial institutions are more than FDIC insured limits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company’s cash management are included as a component of cash for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Restricted  cash is related to the players liability account within current liabilities and is presented as a separate category on the consolidated balance sheets.

 

(f) Promissory note receivable and allowance for credit losses

 

The Company received a secured subordinated promissory note as part of the purchase consideration received for the sale of Complexity (see Note 4). The promissory note receivable is classified as not held-for-sale and measured at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses, in accordance with ASC 310, Receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses to reflect the expected collectability of the promissory note receivable based on historical collection data and specific risks identified, as well as management’s expectation of future economic conditions. At each reporting date the Company assesses whether the credit risk on its promissory note receivable has increased significantly since initial recognition.

 

The promissory note receivable was initially recorded at its transaction closing date fair value on March 1, 2024 (see Note 4) and no allowance for credit losses had been recognized as of March 31, 2024.

 

(g) Concentration of credit risk

 

The Company places its cash, which may at times be in excess of United States’ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits, with high credit quality financial institutions and attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution.

 

                                                                   9

 

 

The Company had one customer whose revenue accounted for approximately 57% and 0% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

No customer individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

(h) Segment reporting

 

In accordance with the ASC 280, Segment Reporting, the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.

 

The CODM uses gross profit, as reviewed at periodic business review meetings, as the key measure of the Company’s results as it reflects the Company’s underlying performance for the period under evaluation to determine resource allocation. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was organized into the three operating segments, which also represent its three reportable segments: Teams, Agency and Software-as-service (SaaS) + Advertising. 

 

ASC 280 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue.

 

3. Recent accounting pronouncements

 

(a) Pending adoption

 

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires that public business entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied prospectively. Retroactive application is permitted. The Company has not early adopted and continues to evaluate the impact of the provisions of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.

 

(b) Adopted

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The provisions of ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. ASU 2023-07 will be applicable for the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Management is currently evaluating and understanding the requirements under this new standard.

 

4. Acquisitions and divestitures

 

(a) FaZe Merger

 

On March 7, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of FaZe (the Merger). Prior to the Merger, the Company created GameSquare Merger Sub I, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) to effect the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Merger Sub merged with FaZe, with FaZe continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

 

                                                                   10

 

 

The Company acquired all issued and outstanding FaZe common shares in exchange for 0.13091 of a GameSquare common share for each FaZe common share (the “Exchange Ratio”). All outstanding FaZe equity awards and warrants to purchase shares of FaZe common stock were acquired and exchanged for GameSquare equity awards and warrants to purchase GameSquare common stock on substantially the same terms, with exercise prices, where applicable, and shares issuable adjusted for the Exchange Ratio.

 

The Company incurred transaction costs of $1.4 million associated with the Merger. All such costs were expensed as incurred. The loss attributed to FaZe’s operations from the acquisition date to March 31, 2024, was $210 thousand, with revenue of $2.6 million.

 

The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the Company recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values are preliminary and based on the information that was available as of that date.

 

The following preliminary table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition:

Measurement period adjustments

 

Where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination, they may be adjusted in subsequent periods, not to exceed twelve months. The primary areas that are subject to change relate to the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred and purchase price allocations related to the fair values of certain tangible assets, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired during the measurement periods.

 

Goodwill

 

The difference between the estimated acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the estimated values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill of $6.5 million.

 

The goodwill recorded represents the following:

 

               ●    Cost savings and operating synergies expected to result from combining the operations of FaZe with those of the

                     Company.

               ●    Intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition such as the assembled workforce.

 

Goodwill arising from the Merger is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 

                                                                   11

 

 

(b) Sale of Complexity

 

On March 1, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary GameSquare Esports (USA), Inc., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) to sell all of the issued and outstanding equity interest of NextGen Tech, LLC (“Complexity”) to Global Esports Properties, LLC (the “Buyer”) (the “Transaction”).

 

Pursuant to the MIPA, Buyer paid the Company aggregate purchase consideration with a Transaction closing date fair value of $7.9 million in exchange for the equity interests of Complexity, including $0.8 million paid in cash upon closing of the transaction and issuance of a secured subordinated promissory note (the “Note”) with a Transaction closing date fair value of $7.1 million. The Note was valued using a discount rate of 15% (Level 3).

 

As a result of the Transaction during the three months ended March 31, 2024, Complexity met the requirements to reported as discontinued operations (see Note 17). The Company recognized a gain of $3.0 million in net income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss after offsetting the consideration received with the carrying value of the disposed assets and liabilities. Complexity assets and liabilities disposed had a net carrying value of $4.9 million and consist primarily of $2.6 million of accounts receivable, $2.2 million of property and equipment, and $1.8 million of intangible assets, partially offset by $0.8 million of accounts payable $1.4 million of accrued liabilities.

 

The Note has a principal amount of $9.5 million and bears interest at 3.0% per annum. The principal amount of the Note, together with all accrued interest, is due on February 28, 2027. The Note is secured by assets of the Buyer pursuant to a Security Agreement executed in conjunction with the MIPA between the Company and the Buyer.

Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of FaZe was allocated to the Teams operating and reportable segment.



There were no impairment charges related to goodwill incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

                                                                   12

7. Line of credit

 

On September 14, 2023, the Company entered into an accounts receivable financing and security agreement with a maximum availability of $10.0 million for a three-year term with SLR Digital Finance, LLC (the “LOC”). The LOC matures on September 14, 2026. Interest accrues on the outstanding principal amount of the LOC at a rate equal to the greater of Prime plus 4.00% or 9.50%, per annum. The terms of the LOC provide for the lender to fund 85% of the purchased accounts receivable and it includes various service fees.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the outstanding principal, and unpaid accrued interest, on the LOC was $4.2 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense of $0.2 million on the outstanding LOC principal balance.

 

8. Convertible debt

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has two convertible debt instruments: a $1.3 million convertible debenture issued to Three Curve Capital LP (“Three Curve CD”) and a $5.7 million convertible debenture issued to King Street Partners LLC (“King Street CD”). The Company elected the FVO for recognition of the Three Curve CD and King Street CD as permitted under ASC 825.

 

Certain registration rights were included in the King Street CD. If the Company does not have an effective registration statement on file with the SEC within either 110 days (if registered on a Form S-3) or 150 days (if registered on a Form S-1) of the December 29, 2023, registering the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of the King Street CD, or fails to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, then liquidated damages would accrue equal to 1% of the outstanding principal of the King Streed CD for every 30 days that the registration statement is not effective. The maximum penalty is equal to 9% of the original principal amount of $5.8 million, or $0.5 million.

 

                                                                   14

 

 

The Company accounts for such damages in accordance with ASC subtopic 825-20, Registration Payment Arrangements (“ASC 825-20”). ASC 825-20 specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument, should be separately recognized and accounted for as a contingency in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies. The registration statement is expected to be declared effective during 2024 and no contingent liability has been recognized in relation to this registration payment arrangement.

9. Shareholders’ Equity

 

(a) Description of the Company’s securities

 

The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares, with no par value. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote in respect of each common share held at shareholder meetings of the Company.

 

(b) Activity for the periods presented

 

On March 7, 2024, 10,132,884 common shares of the Company were issued for the completion of the Merger (see Note 4).

 

In conjunction with the Merger, on March 7, 2024, the Company completed a private placement public in public equity financing (the “PIPE Financing”) with certain investors in which the Company offered 7,194,244 units at a purchase price of $1.39 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million. Each unit consisted of one share of the Company’s common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.15 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of 7,194,224 common shares of the Company and warrants to purchase up to 1,079,136 shares of the Company pursuant to the PIPE Financing. Each warrant has an exercise price of $1.55 per share and expire on March 7, 2029 (see Note 12).

 

On March 24, 2023, 9,109 common shares were issued in settlement of outstanding amounts payable of $0.1 million.

 

On March 10, 2023, 29,359 common shares of the Company were issued to settle contingent consideration on a prior acquisition.

 

10. Net loss per share

 

As the Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the inclusion of certain Options, unvested stock units, warrants, and contingent shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share would be anti-dilutive and, accordingly, were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation.

 

                                                                   16

11. Share-based compensation

 

The Company grants share purchase options (“Options”) for the purchase of common shares to its directors, officers, employees and consultants.

 

Options may be exercisable over periods of up to 10 years as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Option price for shares that are the subject of any Option shall be fixed by the Board when such Option is granted but shall not be less than the market value of such shares at the time of grant.

 

The Omnibus Plan allows the Company to award restricted share units to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries upon such conditions as the Board may establish, including the attainment of performance goals recommended by the Company’s compensation committee. The purchase price for common shares of the Company issuable under each Restricted Share Unit (“RSU”) award, if any, shall be established by the Board at its discretion. Common shares issued pursuant to any RSU award may be made subject to vesting conditions based upon the satisfaction of service requirements, conditions, restrictions, time periods or performance goals established by the board.

 

The TSXV requires the Company to fix the number of common shares to be issued in settlement of awards that are not options. The maximum number of Shares available for issuance pursuant to the settlement of RSU shall be an aggregate of 2,861,658 Shares.

13. Related party transactions

 

(a) Convertible debenture with a director of the Company as counterparty

 

On September 1, 2022, Engine extended convertible debentures that were due to expire in October and November 2022 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 million. Key terms include (a) maturity date of August 31, 2025, (b) interest rate of 7% (interest to be paid in full at maturity) and (c) conversion price of $4.40. The convertible debenture is beneficially held by a director of the Company (see Note 8).

 

14. Commitments and contingencies

 

In April 2020, Engine announced its renegotiation of the acquisition of Allinsports. The revised purchase agreement provided for the acquisition of 100% of Allinsports in exchange for the issuance of 241,666 common shares of the Engine and other considerations, including payments of $1,200,000 as a portion of the purchase consideration. In September 2020, Engine advised the shareholders of Allinsports that closing conditions of the transaction, including the requirement to provide audited financial statements, had not been satisfied.

 

                                                                   19

 

 

In response, in November 2020, the shareholders of Allinsports commenced arbitration in Alberta, Canada seeking, among other things, to compel Engine to complete the acquisition of Allinsports without the audited financial statements, and to issue 241,666 common shares of Engine to those shareholders. As alternative relief, the shareholders of Allinsports sought up to $20.0 million in damages. A hearing in this matter was held in May of 2021, and by a decision dated September 30, 2021, the Arbitrator determined that the closing of the transaction had previously occurred and directed Engine to issue 241,666 common shares. In conjunction with completion of the Arrangement (see Note 4), the Company assumed this obligation to issue 241,666 common shares. The Company is pursuing regulatory approval to issue the shares and is also pursuing relief against Allinsports shareholders for various alleged breaches of the share purchase agreement. The Company recognized a liability for the arbitration ruling of $1.5 million, which represented the fair value of the common shares directed to be delivered as of April 11, 2023, the closing date of the Arrangement. The liability is recorded as arbitration reserve on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. This liability will be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.

 

By Order to Continue dated May 5, 2022, Engine was substituted in as the plaintiff in a matter pending in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, seeking recovery of $2.1 million (€1.9 million) of principal and additional amounts of accrued interest under promissory notes acquired by Engine. The matter is in the discovery stage.

 

The outcomes of pending litigations in which the Company is involved are necessarily uncertain as are the Company’s expenses in prosecuting and defending these actions. From time to time the Company may modify litigation strategy and/or the terms on which it retains counsel and other professionals in connection with such actions, which may affect the outcomes of and/or the expenses incurred in connection with such actions.

 

The Company is subject to various other claims, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records provisions for losses when claims become probable, and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operations, or liquidity.

 

15. Revenue and segmented information

 

The CODM uses gross profit, as reviewed at periodic business review meetings, as the key measure of the Company’s results as it reflects the Company’s underlying performance for the period under evaluation to determine resource allocation. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was organized into the three operating segments, which also represent its three reportable segments: Teams, Agency and Software-as-service (SaaS) + Advertising.

 

                                                                   20

16. Fair value measurements

 

The carrying value of cash approximates fair value. The carrying amount of other current assets and liabilities, such as accounts and other receivables and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts, and such current assets and liabilities are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

(a) Fair values measured on a non-recurring basis

 

The Company’s non-financial assets, such as property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, are recorded at fair value upon a business combination and are remeasured at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. The Company’s investment, accounted for under the measurement alternative of ASC 321, is remeasured at fair value only upon an observable price change or if an impairment charge is recognized. The Company uses unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that are significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations require management’s judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. The Company determines the fair value of its held and used assets, goodwill and intangible assets using an income, cost or market approach as determined reasonable.

Recent Developments

 

Merger Agreement

 

On March 7, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), GameSquare Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (and prior to the Domestication (as defined below), a British Columbia corporation) (the “Company” or “GameSquare”), consummated the previously announced merger (the “Closing”) of FaZe Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FaZe”), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 19, 2023 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, FaZe and GameSquare Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of GameSquare (“Merger Sub”), as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 19, 2023, by and among the Company, FaZe and Merger Sub (the “Amendment to Merger Agreement”). The consummation of the Merger involved (i) prior to the Closing, the continuance of GameSquare from the laws of the Province of British Columbia to the laws of the State of Delaware so as to become a Delaware corporation (the “Domestication”) and (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with and into FaZe, with FaZe continuing as the surviving corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GameSquare (the “Merger”), as well as the other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

 

                                                                   25

 

 

Merger Consideration

 

At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”): (i) each outstanding share of FaZe common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “FaZe Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in treasury by FaZe or held directly by GameSquare or Merger Sub (which such shares were cancelled)) was converted into the right to receive 0.13091 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a fully paid non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of GameSquare (the “GameSquare Common Stock”) and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fraction shares of FaZe Common Stock, subject to applicable withholding, (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of FaZe Common Stock.

 

Treatment of Equity Awards

 

In addition, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of the outstanding FaZe equity awards, including options to purchase shares of FaZe Common Stock, each share of FaZe Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse of restrictions, and each FaZe restricted stock unit convertible into shares of FaZe Common Stock, was assumed by GameSquare and converted into GameSquare equity awards on substantially the same terms, except that the assumed equity awards will cover a number of shares of GameSquare Common Stock and, if applicable, have an exercise price determined using the Exchange Ratio.

 

Also at the Effective Time, all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of FaZe Common Stock were assumed by GameSquare and converted into warrants to purchase shares of GameSquare Common Stock on substantially the same terms, except that the assumed warrants cover a number of shares of GameSquare Common Stock, and have an exercise price, determined using the Exchange Ratio.

 

Post-Closing Governance

 

In connection with the Merger and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) increased the size of the Board from six to nine members and appointed Paul Hamilton and Nick Lewin (each, a “New Director” and collectively, the “New Directors”), who were previously members of FaZe’s board of directors, to serve on the Board, in each case, to hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal. Following the appointment of the New Directors, there remains one vacancy on the Board. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, such vacancy is to be filled at such time that the Board duly elects an individual to serve in such capacity in accordance with the Bylaws and the terms of the Merger Agreement. It has not yet been determined on which committees of the Board Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Lewin will serve.

 

PIPE Financing

 

Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Merger, the Company completed its previously announced private placement in public equity financing (the “PIPE Financing”). In connection with the PIPE Financing, the Company entered subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the Company issued to the PIPE Investors an aggregate of 7,194,244 units at a purchase price per unit of $1.39, for aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million. Each unit consists of one share of GameSquare Common Stock and a warrant to purchase 0.15 shares of GameSquare Common Stock. As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of 7,194,224 shares of GameSquare Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”) and warrants to purchase up to 1,079,136 shares of GameSquare Common Stock (the “PIPE Warrants) pursuant to the PIPE Financing. Each whole PIPE Warrant is exercisable for one share of GameSquare Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.55 per share for a period of five years after the Closing Date.

 

                                                                   26

 

 

The PIPE Shares and PIPE Warrants are subject to a four month hold period under Canadian securities laws expiring four months following the Closing Date. The PIPE Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any U.S. state securities laws, and were issued pursuant to and in accordance with the exemption from registration under the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws.

 

The Company also entered into Registration Rights Agreements with the PIPE Investors (the “Registration Rights Agreements”). The Registration Rights Agreements provide, among other things, that the Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than 150 days after the Closing Date (the “Filing Deadline”), file with the SEC (at the Company’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares and the shares of GameSquare Common Stock underlying the PIPE Warrants issued to the PIPE Investors, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day following the Filing Deadline if the SEC notifies the Company that it will “review” such registration statement and (ii) the fifth business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing) by the SEC that such registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.

 

The Company had previously entered into a backstop agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”) with Goff Jones Strategic Partners, LLC (formerly known as Goff & Jones Lending Co, LLC) (“Goff Jones”), to purchase common stock to ensure the PIPE was fully subscribed. The Backstop Agreement was originally announced on October 20, 2023. A total of $6.0 million of securities were issued to Goff Jones in connection with the Backstop Agreement.

 

Complexity Membership Interest Purchase Agreement

 

On March 1, 2024, Global Esports Properties, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”), GameSquare Esports (USA), Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Seller”) and sole member of NextGen Tech, LLC, a Texas limited liability company doing business as Complexity Gaming, and GameSquare Holdings, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the province of Ontario (“Beneficial Owner”) (together, the “Parties”) entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) for the purchase of all issued and outstanding interests (the “Interests”) of NextGen Tech, LLC, a Texas limited liability company doing business as Complexity Gaming (the “Transaction”).

 

The purchase price for the acquired Interests was $10.4 million, subject to final determination and adjustment pursuant to the purchase price adjustment mechanism set forth in the MIPA (the “Purchase Price”). $0.8 million of the Purchase Price was paid in cash at closing and the remainder was paid at closing by delivery of a secured subordinated promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of the Seller in the principal amount of $9.6 million (the “Principal Amount”). Under the Note, the Company is required pay the Principal Amount of the Note, together with all accrued interest (accrued at a rate equal to 3% per annum), fees, premium, charges, costs, and expenses no later than thirty-six (36) months from the date of the Note.

 

The Note is secured pursuant to a Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”), which provides for a security interest in Buyer’s collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement) to secure any and all indebtedness, obligations, liabilities, and undertakings under or in respect of the Note.

 

The Parties’ obligation to complete the Transaction contemplated by the MIPA is subject to certain conditions, including approval by TSXV, which is still outstanding. Accordingly, the Transaction described herein is subject to risk of completion.

 

The MIPA contains customary representations, warranties, indemnification obligations and agreements of the Parties.

 

                                                                   27

 

 

Current Market Conditions

 

GameSquare is pursuing organic growth opportunities, as well as M&A growth opportunities. From August 2020 to March 2024, the Company has completed five acquisitions and divested two non-core assets. GameSquare’s organic growth strategy focuses on growing audience and reach within its digital agencies, media network, and teams segments. GameSquare’s digital agencies, teams, and services segments serve the gaming and esports market, and more broadly sports and entertainment through content creation, audience development and growing brand relationships. The digital agency industry is highly fragmented, and these businesses are generally characterized by high revenue growth with healthy earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins, which management believes positions the Company well for sustainable growth through organic efforts and presents significant opportunities to grow through accretive acquisitions.

 

The combination of Engine Gaming’s best-in-class technology assets with GameSquare’s award-winning agency and creative capabilities, allows the Company to offer unparalleled insight into consumer behaviors. It also allows GameSquare to develop data-driven creative strategies, and measure and optimize campaigns towards customer acquisition goals in real-time - creating impactful marketing solutions that drive ROI for its customers.

 

The Company has invested in its sales organization and continues to see significant growth in the number, and the size, of requests for proposals within its agency businesses. The Company’s financial profile compares very favorably against its esports peers, as well as other companies seeking to engage with youth audiences.

 

The Company believes enterprise growth may come as a result of synergistic approaches to combining the strengths of its multiple SaaS companies that it can present as a unified offering to the market.

 

The following is a summary of the Company’s financial performance highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. This summary should be considered in the context of the additional disclosures in this MD&A which further highlight Company results by segment.

Management’s use of Non-GAAP Measures

 

This MD&A contains certain financial performance measures, including “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA,” that are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, see the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

 

We believe EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define “EBITDA” as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income taxes; and (iii) interest expense.

 

                                                                   31

 

 

Adjusted EBITDA

 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted to exclude extraordinary items, non-recurring items and other non-cash items, including, but not limited to (i) share based compensation expense, (ii) transaction costs related to merger and acquisition activities, (iii) arbitration settlement reserves and other non-recurring legal settlement expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, primarily comprised of employee severance resulting from integration of acquired businesses, (v) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, (vii) change in fair value of assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis, and (viii) gains and losses from discontinued operations.

 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

 

A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure determined under US GAAP is set out below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Overview

 

The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Continuing operations, as intended, are dependent on management’s ability to raise required funding through future equity issuances, its ability to acquire business interests and develop profitable operations or a combination thereof, which is not assured, given today’s volatile and uncertain financial markets. We may revise programs depending on our working capital position.

 

Our approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. Our liquidity and operating results may be adversely affected if our access to the capital market is hindered, whether as a result of a downturn in stock market conditions generally or as a result of conditions specific to the Company.

 

We regularly evaluate our cash position to ensure preservation and security of capital as well as maintenance of liquidity. As we do not presently generate sufficient revenue to cover costs, managing liquidity risk is dependent upon the ability to reduce monthly operating cash outflow and secure additional financing. The recoverability of the carrying value of the assets and our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to raise financing in the near term, and ultimately the achievement of profitable operations.

 

As of March 31, 2024, cash and restricted cash totaled $7.8 million, compared to $3.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

 

We have plans to raise additional funds. While management has been historically successful in raising the necessary capital, it cannot provide assurance that it will be able to execute its business strategy or be successful in future financing activities.

 

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our ability to raise additional funds through financing, those related to consumer demand and acceptance of our products and services, our ability to collect payments as they become due, achieving our internal forecasts and objectives, the economic conditions of the United States and abroad.



 

                                                                   32

 

 

Sources and Uses of Cash

 

Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily by issuing equity and debt, including the proceeds of the acquisition of Engine. As of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash in the amount of $7.2 million, available borrowings under our line of credit as well as new debt and/or equity issuances.

 

As discussed in recent developments above, we obtained gross proceeds of $10.0 million from the PIPE Financing on March 7, 2024.

 

Operating Activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities was $8.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with $0.7 million used in operating activities in the comparative period. The use of funds in operating activities is described in the Results of Operations section above.

 

Investing Activities

 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Net cash used in investing activities was $120 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Financing Activities

 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was primarily due to PIPE Financing on March 7, 2024. There was no cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Commitments and Contingencies

 

Management commitments

 

The Company is party to certain management contracts. These contracts require payments of approximately $0.6 million to be made upon the occurrence of a change in control and termination without cause to certain officers of the Company. The Company is also committed to payments upon termination without cause of approximately $1.1 million pursuant to the terms of these contracts. As a triggering event has not taken place, these amounts have not been recorded in these consolidated financial statements.

 

Former activities

 

The Company was previously involved in oil and gas exploration activities in Canada, the United States and Colombia. The Company ceased all direct oil and gas exploration activities in 2014. While management estimated that the exposure to additional liabilities from its former oil and gas activities over and above the reclamation deposits held in trust for the Alberta Energy Regulator of $0.3 million to be remote, the outcome of any such contingent matters is inherently uncertain.

 

Litigation and arbitration

 

We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. We record provisions for losses when claims become probable, and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations, or liquidity.

 

                                                                   33

 

 

Revenue recognition

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of its services to a customer.

 

The following provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers, including significant payment terms and related revenue recognition policies:

 

Talent representation service revenues

 

Talent representation service revenue is recorded on completion of the event in which the talent management service has been provided.

 

Influencer promotional fees

 

Influencer marketing and promotional fees are recognized over the period during which the services are performed. Revenue and income from custom service contracts are determined on the percentage of completion method, based on the ratio of contract timepassed in the reporting period over estimated total length of the contract.

 

Consulting fees and other revenues

 

Consulting fees and other revenues are recognized when the services have been performed.

 

Software-as-a-service

 

The Company enters into license agreements with customers for its content management system, video software, and mobile applications (Frankly), e-sports data platform (Stream Hatchet) and an influencer marketing platform (SideQik). These license agreements, generally non-cancellable, without paying a termination penalty, and multiyear, provide the customer with the right to use the Company’s application solely on a Company-hosted platform or, in certain instances, on purchased encoders. The license agreements also entitle the customer to technical support.

 

Revenue from these license agreements is recognized ratably over the license term. Early termination fees are recognized when a customer ceases use of agreed upon services prior to the expiration of their contract. These fees are recognized in full on the date the customer has completed their migration of the Company’s solutions and there is no continuing service obligation to the customer.

 

The Company charges its customers for the optional use of its content delivery network to stream and store videos. The revenue is recognized as earned based on the actual usage because it has stand-alone value and delivery is in control of the customer. The Company also charges its customers for the use of its ad serving platform to serve ads under local advertising campaigns. The Company reports revenue as earned based on the actual usage.

 

Advertising

 

Under national advertising agreements with advertisers, the Company sources, creates, and places advertising campaigns that run across the Company’s network of publisher sites. National advertising revenue, net of third-party costs, is shared with publishers based on their respective contractual agreements. The Company invoices national advertising amounts due from advertisers and remits payments to publishers for their share. Depending on the agreement with the publisher, the obligation to remit payment to the publisher is based on either billing to the advertiser or the collection of cash from the advertiser.

 

National advertising revenue is recognized in the period during which the ad impressions are delivered. The Company reports revenue earned through national advertising agreements either on a net or gross basis. The Company applies judgement in recognizing revenue earned through national advertising agreements on a net or gross basis based on the criteria as disclosed below.

 

Under national advertising agreements wherein the Company does not bear inventory risk and only has credit risk on its portion of the revenue, national advertising revenues are accounted for on a net basis and the publisher is identified as the customer. In select national advertising agreements with its publishers, the Company takes on inventory risk and additional credit risk. Under these agreements, the Company either a) provides the publisher with a guaranteed minimum gross selling price per advertising unit delivered, wherein the greater of the actual selling price or guaranteed minimum selling price is used in determining the publisher’s share or b) provides the publisher with a fixed rate per advertising unit delivered, wherein the publisher is paid the fixed rate per advertising unit delivered irrespective of the actual selling price. Under these national advertising agreements, national advertising revenues are accounted for on a gross basis with the advertiser identified as the customer and the publisher identified as a supplier, with amounts billed to the advertiser reported as revenue and amounts due to the publisher reported as a revenue sharing expense, within expenses.

 

                                                                   34

 

 

Also included in advertising revenue is advertising revenue generated by the Company’s various owned and operated properties.

 

Brand Sponsorships

 

The Company offers advertisers a full range of promotional vehicles, including but not limited to online advertising, livestream announcements, event content generation, social media posts, logo placement on the Company’s official merchandise, and special appearances of members of the Company’s talent roster. The Company’s brand sponsorship agreements may include multiple services that are capable of being individually distinct; however the intended benefit is an association with the Company’s brand, and the services are not distinct within the context of the contracts. Revenues from brand sponsorship agreements are recognized ratably over the contract term. Payment terms and conditions vary, but payments are generally due periodically throughout the term of the contract. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of billing, management has determined the brand sponsorship agreements generally do not include a significant financing component.

 

Content

 

The Company and its talent roster generate and produce original content which the Company monetizes through Google’s AdSense service. Revenue is variable and is earned when the visitor views or “clicks through” on the advertisement. The amount of revenue earned is reported to the Company monthly and is recognized upon receipt of the report of viewership activity. Payment terms and conditions vary, but payments are generally due within 30 to 45 days after the end of each month.

 

The Company grants exclusive licenses to customers for certain content produced by the Company’s talent. The Company grants the customer a license to the intellectual property, which is the content and its use in generating advertising revenues, for a pre-determined period, for an amount paid by the customer, in most instances, upon execution of the contract. The Company’s only performance obligation is to license the content for use in generating advertising revenues, and the Company recognizes the full contract amount at the point at which the Company provides the customer access to the content, which is at the execution of the contract. The Company has no further performance obligations under these types of contracts and does not anticipate generating any additional revenue from these arrangements apart from the contract amount.

 

Consumer Products

 

The Company earns consumer products revenue from sales of the Company’s consumer products on the Company’s website or at live or virtual events. Revenues are recognized at a point in time, as control is transferred to the customer upon shipment. The Company offers customer returns and discounts through a third-party distributor and accounts for this as a reduction to revenue. The Company does not offer loyalty programs or other sales incentive programs that are material to revenue recognition. Payment is due at the time of sale. The Company has outsourced the design, manufacturing, fulfillment, distribution, and sale of the Company’s consumer products to a third party in exchange for royalties based on the amount of revenue generated. Management evaluated the terms of the agreement to determine whether the Company’s consumer products revenues should be reported gross or net of royalties paid. Key indicators that management evaluated in determining whether the Company is the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:

 

     ●    the Company is the party that is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service,

           

     ●    the Company has inventory risk before the good is transferred to the customer, and

           

     ●    the Company is the party that has discretion in establishing pricing for the specified good or service.

 

Based on management’s evaluation of the above indicators, the Company reports consumer products revenues on a gross basis.

 

Esports

 

League Participation: Generally, The Company has one performance obligation—to participate in the overall Esport event—because the underlying activities do not have standalone value absent the Company’s participation in the tournament or event. Revenue from prize winnings and profit-share agreements is variable and is highly uncertain. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when the uncertainty is resolved.

 

Player Transfer Fees: Player transfer agreements include a fixed fee and may include a variable fee component. The Company recognizes the fixed portion of revenue from transfer fees upon satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation, which coincides with the execution of the related agreement. The variable portion of revenue is considered highly uncertain and is recognized at the point in time when the uncertainty is resolved.

 

Licensing of Intellectual Property: The Company’s licenses of intellectual property generate royalties that are recognized in accordance with the royalty recognition constraint. That is, royalty revenue is recognized at the time when the sale occurs.

 

The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue recognized is the net amount of commission made by the Company.

 

Deferred revenue consists of customer advances for Company services to be rendered that will be recognized as income in future periods.

 

                                                                   35

 

 

Income taxes

 

Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.

 

Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at year end, adjusted for amendments to tax payable with regards to previous years.

 

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates, and jointly controlled entities to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the financial position reporting date applicable to the period of expected realization or settlement.

 

A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized.

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

 

Investments

 

Investments in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns an interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant influence.

 

In accordance with ASC 321 “Investments—Equity Securities” (“ASC 321”), equity securities which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% ownership interest) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either at fair value or using the measurement alternative which is at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. All gains and losses on investments in equity securities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

                                                                   36

 

 

Equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative, the Company assesses the securities for impairment indicators, at least annually, or more frequently if there are any indicators of impairment. If the assessment indicates that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value of the investment will be recorded.

 

Business combinations

 

The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the relevant acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires the Company to perform valuations with significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill

 

Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets. The Company assesses for impairment of asset groups, including intangible assets, at least annually, or more frequently if there are any indicators for impairment.

 

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

 

When a triggering event that occurred during the reporting period is identified, or when the annual impairment test is required, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If the Company determines it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, an impairment test is not necessary. If an impairment test is necessary, management estimates the fair value of the Company. If the carrying value of the Company exceeds its fair value, goodwill is determined to be impaired, and an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value of the Company will be recorded. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, further testing is unnecessary.

 

Fair value option for convertible debt

 

The Company elected the Fair Value Option (“FVO”) for recognition of its convertible debt as permitted under ASC 825, Financial Instruments. Under the FVO, the Company recognizes the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The FVO may be applied instrument by instrument, but it is irrevocable. As a result of applying the FVO, any direct costs and fees related to the convertible debt is recognized in operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred and not deferred. Changes in fair value of the convertible debt is recognized as a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 

                                                                   37

 

 

Contingencies

 

The Company estimates loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies, which states that a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available before the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (ii) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company including, without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments as of the balance sheet date that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, the timing of their adoptions and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this Item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024. Material weaknesses relating to the Design and Implementation of Control Activities and Monitoring Activities were identified. The Company did not have sufficient resources with the relevant expertise to perform an effective risk assessment process, design and implement controls supported by documentation and provide evidence that such controls designed was based on the COSO Framework.

 

The material weaknesses in risk assessment, control activities and monitoring activities contributed to the following material weaknesses: (i) the Company did not complete a documented risk assessment, and (ii) the Company did not identify all risks and design relevant controls related to system of internal controls. As a consequence of the aggregation of the foregoing deficiencies in the Company’s DC&P and ICFR design, the Company did not have effective control activities related to the design of process-level and management review control activities. Aside from these deficiencies, management believes that the Company’s consolidated financial statements for three months ended March 31, 2024, present fairly in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Company does not believe and is not aware of any circumstance in which the potential weaknesses have impacted the Company’s financial reporting and as a result, there were no material adjustments to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024. In addition, there were no changes to previously released financial results. However, if the collective deficiencies were deemed to create a material weakness, a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

Management’s Remediation Measures

 

To address the deficiencies identified, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee, has implemented, or will implement, remediation measures to further address the deficiencies in the design of its DC&P and ICFR. The Company intends to complete such remedial measures by December 31, 2025. Management has also performed an initial risk assessment using a top-down, risk-based approach with respect to the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, compensating controls have been applied to a number of areas where the risks of material misstatement are considered moderate to high. The Company is engaging outside resources to strengthen the business process documentation and help with management’s self assessment and testing of internal controls. Although the Company can give no assurance that these actions will remediate these deficiencies or that additional deficiencies or a material weaknesses will not be identified in the future, management believes the foregoing efforts will, when implemented, strengthen our DC&P and ICFR. Management will take additional remedial actions as necessary as they continue to evaluate and work to improve the Company’s control environment.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   38

 

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

The Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of its business.

 

In April 2020, Engine announced its renegotiation of the acquisition of Allinsports. The revised purchase agreement provided for the acquisition of 100% of Allinsports in exchange for the issuance of 241,666 common shares of the Engine and other considerations, including payments of $1,200,000 as a portion of the purchase consideration. In September 2020, Engine advised the shareholders of Allinsports that closing conditions of the transaction, including the requirement to provide audited financial statements, had not been satisfied.

 

In response, in November 2020, the shareholders of Allinsports commenced arbitration in Alberta, Canada seeking, among other things, to compel Engine to complete the acquisition of Allinsports without the audited financial statements, and to issue 241,666 common shares of Engine to those shareholders. As alternative relief, the shareholders of Allinsports sought up to $20.0 million in damages. A hearing in this matter was held in May of 2021, and by a decision dated September 30, 2021, the Arbitrator determined that the closing of the transaction had previously occurred and directed Engine to issue 241,666 common shares. In conjunction with completion of the Arrangement (see Note 4), the Company assumed this obligation to issue 241,666 common shares. The Company is pursuing regulatory approval to issue the shares and is also pursuing relief against Allinsports shareholders for various alleged breaches of the share purchase agreement. The Company recognized a liability for the arbitration ruling of $1.5 million, which represented the fair value of the common shares directed to be delivered as of April 11, 2023, the closing date of the Arrangement. The liability is recorded as arbitration reserve on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. This liability will be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.

 

By Order to Continue dated May 5, 2022, Engine was substituted in as the plaintiff in a matter pending in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, seeking recovery of $2.1 million (€1.9 million) of principal and additional amounts of accrued interest under promissory notes acquired by Engine. The matter is in the discovery stage.

 

The outcomes of pending litigations in which the Company is involved are necessarily uncertain as are the Company’s expenses in prosecuting and defending these actions. From time to time the Company may modify litigation strategy and/or the terms on which it retains counsel and other professionals in connection with such actions, which may affect the outcomes of and/or the expenses incurred in connection with such actions.

 

                                                                   39

 

 

The Company is subject to various other claims, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records provisions for losses when claims become probable, and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operations, or liquidity.
