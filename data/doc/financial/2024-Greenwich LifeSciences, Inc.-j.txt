GREENWICH LIFESCIENCES, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

 

1. Organization and Description of the Business

 

Greenwich LifeSciences, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2006 under the name Norwell, Inc. In March 2018, Norwell, Inc. changed its name to Greenwich LifeSciences, Inc. In February 2023, Greenwich LifeSciences Europe Limited was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary in Ireland. The Company is developing a breast cancer immunotherapy focused on preventing the recurrence of breast cancer following surgery.

 

2. Going Concern

 

The Company has prepared its financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred net losses since its inception and has negative operating cash flows. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $5,505,975. For the foreseeable future, the Company’s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional capital.

 

3. Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of the Company contained elsewhere herein.

 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as reported in the Company’s Form 10-K have been omitted.

 

Leases

 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842), which significantly amends the way companies are required to account for leases. Under the updated leasing guidance, some leases that did not have to be reported previously are now required to be presented as an asset and liability on the balance sheet. In addition, for certain leases, what was previously classified as an operating expense must now be allocated between amortization expense and interest expense. The Company elected to adopt this update using the modified retrospective transition method and prior periods have not been restated. The current monthly rent is approximately $2,626. The month-to-month sub-lease is from a related party and the underlying lease expires in May of 2024. Any right of use asset and liability is deemed to be nominal as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share

 

As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had common stock equivalents related to warrants outstanding to acquire 20,174 shares of the Company’s common stock.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had common stock equivalents related to options outstanding to acquire 1,498,128 shares of the Company’s common stock.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has no common stock equivalents related to convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.

 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per common share for the periods indicated:

License Obligation, Legal Expenses, and Manufacturing Agreements

 

The Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Henry M. Jackson Foundation (“HJF”) in April 2009, as amended, pursuant to which it acquired exclusive marketing rights to GP2, the Company’s product candidate. In consideration for such licensed rights, the Company issued HJF 202,619 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $0.267 per share, which is amortized over 15 years at $3,607 per year. Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, the Company is required to pay an annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments based on sales of GP2 and to reimburse HJF for patent expenses related to GP2. The Company currently depends on third-party contract manufacturers for all required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidate for the Company’s clinical trials. Accrued interest is owed to HJF, which totals $220,845 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Legal Proceedings

 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. Any of these claims could subject the Company to costly legal expenses and, while management generally believes that there will be adequate insurance to cover different liabilities at such time the Company becomes a public company and commences clinical trials, the Company’s future insurance carriers may deny coverage or policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage the Company’s reputation and business. The Company is currently not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding the future financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “should,” “plan,” “expect,” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

 

In addition, our business and financial performance may be affected by the factors that are discussed under “Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on April 15, 2024. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

 

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

 

The following discussion and analysis is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information set forth in the financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.

 

Overview

 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on our Phase III clinical trial, Flamingo-01, which is evaluating GLSI-100, an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences. GP2 is a 9 amino acid transmembrane peptide of the HER2/neu protein, a cell surface receptor protein that is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including expression in 75% of breast cancers at low (1+), intermediate (2+), and high (3+ or over-expressor) levels. The combination of GP2 + GM-CSF is called GLSI-100. We are currently expanding Flamingo-01 into Europe with plans to open up to 150 sites globally. Flamingo-01 is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLSI-100 in HER2/neu positive patients with residual disease or high-risk pathologic complete response at surgery and who have completed both neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant trastuzumab based treatment.

 

To date, we have not generated any revenue and we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were approximately $8.9 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and $2.5 million and $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing the drug in our pipeline, planning and preparing for clinical trials and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and corresponding increased operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our pipeline. Our costs may further increase as we conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for and prepare to commercialize our product candidate. We expect to incur significant expenses to continue to build the infrastructure necessary to support our expanded operations, clinical trials, commercialization, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. We will also experience increased costs associated with operating as a public company.

 

                                                                  -9-                                                                   

 

 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

Research and Development Expenses

 

Research and development expenses increased by $366,606, or 20%, to $2,194,513 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $1,827,907 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in clinical expenses.

 

General and Administrative Expenses

 

General and administrative expenses decreased by $70,487, or 17%, to $342,688 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $413,175 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Since our inception in 2006, we have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities. We have not yet achieved commercialization of our product and have a cumulative net loss from our operations. We will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

 

We will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and/or debt securities; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful at raising additional capital in the future. If our plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, we may have to further modify our business plan, which may require us to raise additional capital. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was our cash, which totalled $5,505,975 and $6,989,424, respectively, and additional loans and accrued unreimbursed expenses from related parties. Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and related party loans. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations, funding of research and development, including our clinical trials, and general working capital requirements.

 

Cash Flow Activities for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

We incurred net losses of $2,473,195 and $2,124,902 during the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in cash compensation, clinical, and manufacturing expenses.

 

Operating Activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities was $1,782,565 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1,556,807 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Investing Activities

 

We did not use or generate cash from investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

                                                                  -10-                                                                  

 

 

Financing Activities

 

Between January 1, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company completed At The Market (“ATM”) offerings pursuant to its ATM agreement with Jefferies, in which it issued and sold a total of 27,117 shares of its common stock at an average offering price of $12.26 per share for gross proceeds of $332,351 and net proceeds of $299,116, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses borne by the Company, which totalled $33,235.

 

Between April 1, 2024 and May 8, 2024, the Company completed At The Market (“ATM”) offerings pursuant to its ATM agreement with Jefferies, in which it issued and sold a total of 4,713 shares of its common stock at an average offering price of $17.08 per share for gross proceeds of $80,482 and net proceeds of $72,434, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses borne by the Company, which totalled $8,049.

 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

 

As of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material contractual obligations, other than employment and shareholder agreements and the license for GP2 from HJF.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

As of March 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as described by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses in the periods presented.

 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, particularly given the significant social and economic disruptions and uncertainties associated with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the COVID-19 control responses.

 

Recent Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The main objective of the standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The update is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s audited financial statements and related disclosures.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

 

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The main objective of the amendment is to modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of various Topics in the Codification. Certain amendments represent clarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. to eliminate disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded. The effective date for each amendment will be when the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.

 

JOBS Act

 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

 

We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.

 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information required under this Item 3.

 

                                                                  -11-                                                                  

 

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer has concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping. Under the direction of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we are developing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.
