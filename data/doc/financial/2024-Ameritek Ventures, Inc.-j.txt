Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 2, of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.

 

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “proposed,” “intended,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other “forward-looking” information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

2.SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 

 

Basis of Accounting

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared under accrual of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ("US GAAP"). These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein.

 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

 

Long-lived Assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized as equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.

 

Property and Equipment

Equipment is recorded at its acquisition cost, which includes the costs to bring the equipment to the condition and location for its intended use, and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset as follows:

 

Furniture and fixtures                                                                                                                                                     5 years

Computers and equipment                                                                                                                                                  3-5 years

Website development                                                                                                                                                        3 years

Leasehold improvements                                                                                                                                                     5 years

 

Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

 

Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets due to transfer of ownership after the lease term has expired.

 

Maintenance and repairs will be charged to expenses as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations. 

 

Property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever impairment indicators are prevalent. The Company will assess the recoverability of equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment, if any, will be measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Under FASB ASC 820-10-05, the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheets are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company has debt instruments that require fair value measurement on a recurring basis.

Intangible Assets and Intellectual Property

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit of five to fifteen years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into consideration events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. The Company’s accumulated amortization expense on intangible assets totaled $10,045 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $441,326 for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

(a)Product Development 

During the fourth quarter of 2022, certain historical accounts have been reclassified to comply with their treatment according to ASC. What was classified as goodwill in 2021 is classified as product development for 2022. Upon further consideration, discussion and review, the Company has reverted to its previous classification of goodwill, separating goodwill from product development during 2023. Goodwill is not being amortized.

 

(b)Patent 

The Company has a US patent 9217598B2 for FlexFridge, a foldable refrigerator, acquired with the Bozki merger. The patent is not being amortized because we have not put it into production yet. However, we will amortize it when it goes into production. 

Ameritek Ventures sold in the first quarter of 2022 a drone patent in exchange for 3,500,000 common shares per share Canadian to ZenaTech, Inc, a related party, at the exchange rate of 1.2691 $US to CAN$, as listed by https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/. Ameritek realized $661,887 revenue from this sale equally from the period January 1 through December 31, 2022.

 

Goodwill

The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach, and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. 

 

The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company's evaluation of goodwill completed during the past periods resulted in no impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Change in accounting policy for goodwill during financial statements made during fiscal year 2023

 

The Company acquired Interactive Systems, Inc. in May 2021. The cost of the acquisition in excess of net tangible assets was $775,761. Of this amount, $362,721 was associated with product development and amortized over a period of just under two years, which corresponds to the useful life of the asset. The remaining amount of $413,039 is associated with goodwill. Product development cost was determined based on the cost the Company would have incurred to develop the software acquired. Amortization expense was recorded correctly during the period since acquisition. 

 

The Company incorrectly recorded the net product development cost as goodwill on the balance sheet and in the associated footnotes. Accordingly, goodwill on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 was reduced by $42,457 and product development cost was increased by a net amount of $42,457. The amount of the reclass as of December 31, 2022 included gross intangible of $362,721 and accumulated amortization of $320,264. Product development costs associated with this asset as of December 31, 2021 included gross intangible of $362,721 and accumulated amortization of $150,435, which is a net asset of $212,286.

 

During the fourth quarter of 2022, certain historical accounts have been reclassified to comply with their treatment according to ASC. What was classified as goodwill in 2021 is classified as product development for 2022. Upon further consideration, discussion and review, the Company has reversed its previous classification of goodwill, separating goodwill from product development. There was no change in the accounting treatment. The Company has made various acquisitions and mergers historically. In the years of acquisitions/mergers, the Company has treated excess consideration paid in acquisition as product development (intangible other than goodwill) or goodwill. Although the same treatment was applied under the account title ‘Goodwill’ until September 2022, but was treated as product development, an intangible other than goodwill. In December 2022, the Company changed the nomenclature of this account from goodwill to product development. The previous year's figures as of December 31, 2022 are for twelve months in the balance sheet and have not been reinstated for the adjustments for change in the accounting of goodwill and product development. This is because of the change in the adjustments as stated in the above paragraphs that have been carried out in the current year. 

 

The Company changed its accounting policy of classification of excess amount paid in the various acquisitions and mergers from product development (intangible other than goodwill) to goodwill for the financial statements as of June 30, 2023 and revised the useful life of reclassified product development cost in case of Interactive Systems, Inc. 

 

The Company went to its original classification of goodwill in 2023. It does notcurrently amortize goodwill. 

There is no effect in the year ending December 31, 2023 due to going back to the original treatment period of goodwill.

 

Beneficial Conversion Features

From time to time, the Company may issue convertible notes that may contain an imbedded beneficial conversion feature. A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of warrants if related warrants have been granted. 

 

The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is recorded as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method.

Basic and Diluted Net Earnings per Share

Basic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, 

consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock options. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

 

Earnings per Share

The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.

 

Dividends

The Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the period shown.

 

Revenue Recognition

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”

 

Performance Obligations

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance obligations are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.

 

Our Company sells software with the following terms, twelve months, six months, three months and one month. Ameritek earns its revenue with the passage of time. Any unearned revenue is classified as deferred revenue. For each reporting period we prepare a schedule to separate the revenue earned from the deferred revenue and book the deferred amount. Deferred revenue are payments received from customers for products or services that have not been delivered yet. There are no costs associated with the deferred revenue since all the costs are incurred in day-to-day operations and through the passage of time.

 

We had $441,324 of outstanding performance obligations comprised of deferred revenue as of March 31, 2024. Ameritek expects to recognize approximately 25% in the first quarter of 2024, 25% in the second quarter of 2024 and the remaining thereafter. The amount transferred to revenue from deferred revenue during the first three months of 2024 was $151,004.

 

Revenue Recognition

The Company designs and sells various software and maintenance programs to business enterprises including, among others, warehouse distribution to printing and battery manufacturing companies, and marketing services to financial services and insurance companies, printing, or advertising companies. Prior to shipment, each software product is tested extensively to meet Company specifications. The software is shipped fully functional via electronic delivery but requires some installation and setup.

 

Installation is a standard process, outlined in the owner's manual, consisting principally of setup, calibrating, and testing the software. A purchaser of the software could complete the process using the information in the owner's manual, although it would probably take significantly longer than it would take the Company’s technicians to perform the tasks. Although other vendors do not install the Company’s software, they do provide largely interchangeable installation services for a fee. Historically, the Company has never sold the software without installation. Most installations are performed by the Company within 7 to 24 days of shipment and are included in the overall sales price of the software. In addition, the customer must pay for support contracts and training packages, depending on their desired level of service. The Company is the only manufacturer of the software and it only sells software on a standalone basis directly to the end user.

 

The sales price of the arrangement consists of the software, installation, and training and support services, which the customer is obligated to pay in full upon delivery of the software. In addition, there are no general rights of return involved in these arrangements. Therefore, the software is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting.

 

The Company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price for the software because it does not sell the software separately (without installation services and support contracts). In addition, third-party evidence of selling price does not exist as no vendor separately sells the same or largely interchangeable software. Therefore, the Company uses its best estimate of selling price when allocating such arrangement consideration.

 

In estimating its selling price for the software, the Company considers the cost to produce the software, profit margin for similar arrangements, customer demand, effect of competitors on the Company’s software, and other market constraints. When applying the relative selling price method, the Company uses its best estimate of selling price for the software, and third-party evidence of selling price for the installation. Accordingly, without considering whether any portion of the amount allocable to the software is contingent upon delivery of the other items, the Company allocates the selling price to the software, support, and installation.

 

The Company doesn’t currently provide product warranties, but if it does in the future it will provide for specific product lines and accrue for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the revenue is recognized.

 

Collection Policy

When all collections activities are exhausted and an account receivable is deemed uncollected, the company creates a reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on management experience, which may involve obtaining a legal opinion on its collectability, the company will then write off the amount uncollectible by reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts.

 

Income Taxes

The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes as prescribed by the FASB Accounting Standard Codification, ("ASC"), 740 (Income Taxes). This method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax return and financial statement reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities.

 



10



As required by ASC 740-10, "Income Taxes", the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Management does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions which would have a material impact on the financial statements. The Company has elected to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. To date, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

 

Advertising

Advertising is expensed when incurred. Ameritek spent $40,467 and $9,851, on advertising for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s financials properly reflect the change. The Company currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are studying, and feel may be applicable.

 

Bansal & Co. LLP served as our principal independent public accountant for reporting fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 

3.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 



Under FASB ASC 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.

 

The Company does not have any financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

 

Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

 

Level 2 – Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

 

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

 

The following schedules summarize the valuation of financial instruments at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Meridian Pacific Holdings, LLC filed a lawsuit against certain directors, officers, affiliates, and the Company for breach of contract and fraud, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles on May 6, 2024.

The judge in this case dismissed all claims against Ameritek Ventures, Inc. on October 19, 2023.

 

The Company filed a lawsuit in the Clark County, Nevada, court against Clinton L. Stokes, III, the former owner of the Company, to settle the matter of shares ownership and that of if the asset coming from Fiber Optic Assets was purchased free and clear of any encumberment from Meridian Financial Group, LLC on March 6, 2023.

still pending. There is no trial date set for this case. This litigation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company.

 

1.INCOME TAXES 

 

The Company accounts for income taxes at each calendar year-end under FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC 740 "Income Taxes." ASC 740 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, referred to as temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year-end are determined using the currently enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.

The Company did not have any eligible net operating income (or loss) carry forwards as the Company has not filed the appropriate federal and state income tax returns so any accumulated net operating income (or loss) could be subject to the respective tax agency disallowance for the fiscal year ended 2023. Any actual net operating income would be limited by the accelerated depreciation and basis reduction of noncash assets acquired. 

 

The Company did not pay any income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Results of Operations

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023

 

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

 

Results of Operations

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023

 

Ameritek had operating revenue of $215,922 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $242,320 for the same period ended 2023, a decrease of $26,398, or 11%, considered normal fluctuation. The Company operational activity settled into normal activity levels.

 

Total operating expenses decreased as the Company is now using the proprietary server from Epazz, Inc. and not loaning cloud space from third party vendors. Total general and administrative expenses were $153,566 for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 27% or $56,985 as compared to expenses incurred during the same three-month period in 2023. The changes that occurred during this period were due to development and support expenses being lower by $16,876 or 14% in 2024 since Ameritek had less software and programming done than in 2023; general and administrative expenses had an increase of 6% to $40,752 from $38,403; and, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $42,458, or 81%, booked at $10,045 for the first three months of 2024 from $52,503 in 2023. This change was due to changing the goodwill classification back to goodwill from product development costs recorded as goodwill and described in detail in the financial statements footnote 2.

 

Net operating income before other income was $62,356 for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to a net income of $31,769 for 2023, a positive net change of $62,746.

 

Interest expense was $42,639 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $38,526, an 11% increase compared to the same 2023 period. 

 

Ameritek had an increase in net income of $26,454 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 period. The Company had a net income of $19,697 during the first three months of 2024 as compared to a net loss of $(6,757) realized during the same period of 2023. This change was due to the factors explained above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Cash Flow

 

The Company currently funds its operations, including working capital and capital expenditures, and acquisitions through cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and financing activities as necessary. We expect that cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and other sources of liquidity, such as issuing equity or debt securities, subject to market conditions, will be available and sufficient to meet all foreseeable cash requirements. The following is a summary of the changes in the Company’s cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:

 

                                                                                                                Three months ended

                                                                                                                     March 31,

                                                                          Change ($)                      2024                         2023

Cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities            $                 (99,833)$                       (16,784)$                  83,049

Cash flow (used in) provided by investing activities            $                        –$                              –$                       –

Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities            $                   96,639$                         13,411$                (83,228)

 

Operating activities

 

Cash flow used in operating activities was $(16,784) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to a cash provided by operating activities of $83,049 for the same period of 2023. Net operating income increased by $26,454 during 2024 as compared to the same 2023 period. Amortization and depreciation decreased by $42,458 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, due to incorrectly showing goodwill as product development. Another item affecting this section was the amortization of the line of credit commitment fees of $1,848 for 2024 as compared to none in 2023.

Deferred revenue increased by $321,930 due to more service revenue being recorded at the end of 2024 as compared to 2023. This amount was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $279,699 and accounts payable of $127,340, while the accrued interest stayed about the same at around $29,500. 

 

Investing Activities

 

There were no investing activities during the three months ending March 31, 2024, or 2023. 

 

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities was $13,411 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, while cash used in financing activities was $(83,229) for the same 2023 period. This difference represents an increase of $96,639 of proceeds from long-term debt, because of an increase in long-term debt funds of $25,750 and an increase of $70,889 of the long-term debt funds as a repayment of long-term debt.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company had $2,245 in cash as of March 31, 2024, as compared with $572 as of March 31, 2023. Ameritek continues to rely on borrowings to finance its working capital needs.

 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

Management did not contemplate any accounting standards and interpretations issued which are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, operations or cash flows during the three months ended March 31, 2024, or for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk‌

 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the material weaknesses described below.

Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management concluded that we had “material weaknesses” (as such term is defined below) in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the Evaluation Date:

 

           1)      lack of a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal

                   control and procedures;

                   and

                   

           2)     inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.

 

A “material weakness” is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.

 

A system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION‌

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings‌

 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as discussed below, we are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us.

 

Meridian Pacific Holdings, LLC filed a lawsuit against certain directors, officers, affiliates, and the Company for breach of contract and fraud, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles on May 6, 2019. The lawsuit alleges that certain officers of the Company misrepresented the business and asked for financing the business for approximately $1.6 million for operations from Meridian Pacific and never delivered the fiber optic assets promised. The judge in this case dismissed all claims against Ameritek Ventures, Inc. on October 19, 2023.

 

The Company filed a lawsuit in the Clark County, Nevada, court against Clinton L. Stokes, III, the former owner of the Company, to settle the matter of shares ownership and that of if the asset coming from Fiber Optic Assets was purchased free and clear of any encumberment from Meridian Financial Group, LLC on March 6, 2023. Meridian Financial Group, LLC has a claim on the assets in the business of fiber optics previously owned by Clinton L. Stokes III. This case is still pending. There is no trial date set as of the date of this filing. This litigation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company.
