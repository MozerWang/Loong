Forward Looking Information
 
This annual report contains statements about future events and expectations that are characterized as “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs, assumptions, and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to be materially different from the expectations of future results, performance, and financial condition we express or imply in such forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Except as required by federal securities laws, we disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations. The Company focused on implementing a new operational direction.  After a thorough evaluation process, the Company found that there is a substantial long-term demand for specific commodities relating to battery and new energy technologies. This presents a timely and unique opportunity based on rising demand characteristics.  By capitalizing on market trends and current sustainable energy government mandates and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, we will focus on bringing a vertically-integrated solution to market.
 
Asset Sale
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved an asset sale of the assets related to the legacy MiniMelts brand for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of its shareholders. These MiniMelts assets generated 100% of the revenue reported during the year ended December 31, 2019. Part of the proceeds from the sale was used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes.
 
Employees
 
As of September 24, 2021, the Company had one full-time employee and a part time employee. 
 
Websites

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
 
An investment in our securities is subject to numerous risks, including the Risk Factors described below. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also materially affect our business. In such case, we may not be able to proceed with our planned operations and your investment may be lost entirely. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements. An investment in our securities should only be acquired by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment without adversely affecting their standard of living or financial security.
 
We have a limited operating history and may not be able to achieve financial or operational success.
 
We were founded in March 2007, initiated our first operating business in October 2009, exited from our first operating business in March 2013, and acquired another operating business in January 2014, which we modified, sold certain operating assets and retained others. Our current focus in the renewable energy sector will rely heavily on our management teams market knowledge. We management does have operating history with respect to this new corporate direction we have to identify, acquire and operate a new line of business. As a result, we may not be able to achieve sustained financial or operational success, given the risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays and difficulties associated with an early-stage business in an evolving market.
 
Our growth strategy includes acquisitions that entail significant execution, integration and operational risks.
 
We are pursuing a growth strategy based in part on acquisitions, with the objective of creating a combined company that we believe can achieve increased cost savings and operating efficiencies through economies of scale especially in the integration of administrative services. We will seek to make additional acquisitions in the future to increase our revenue.
 
This growth strategy involves significant risks. There is significant competition for acquisition targets in our markets. Consequently, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisitions or may have difficulty finding attractive businesses for acquisition at reasonable prices. If we are unable to identify future acquisition opportunities, reach agreement with such third parties or obtain the financing necessary to make such acquisitions, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to make such acquisitions. 
 
If we are unable to develop and market new offerings or fail to predict or respond to emerging trends, our revenue and any profitability will suffer.
 
Our future success will depend on our management team’s implementation of their new business plan and the success of the initial key renewal energy projects. The volatility of natural resources may also affect the viability of projects.
 
 We depend on key management, product management, technical and marketing personnel for continued success.
 
Our success and future growth depend, to a significant degree, on the skills and continued services of our management team, including Andrew Boutsikakis, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pat Avery, our Chief Operating Officer. Our ongoing success also depends on our ability to identify, hire and retain skilled and qualified technical and marketing personnel in a highly competitive employment market. As we develop and acquire new products and services, we will need to hire additional employees. Our inability to attract and retain well-qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel may have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
2
 
 
We may be required to seek additional funding, and such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
 
We may seek additional funding, however due to a number of factors beyond our expectations or control, including a shortfall in revenue, increased expenses, a need for working capital for growth, increased investment in capital equipment or the acquisition of businesses, services or technologies. The required funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business would be harmed. Even if we were able to find outside funding sources, we might be required to issue securities in a transaction that could be highly dilutive to our investors or we may be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today. We may also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to generate or raise capital that is sufficient to fund our operations, we may be required to curtail operations, reduce our services, defer or cancel expansion or acquisition plans or cease operations in certain jurisdictions or completely.
 
The termination, non-renewal or renegotiation on materially adverse terms of our contracts or relationships with one or more of our significant host locations, product suppliers and partners could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain contractual relationships with our host locations in profitable locations. Our typical host location agreement ranges from one to three years and automatically renews until we or the host retailer gives notice of termination. Certain contract provisions with our host locations vary, including product and service offerings, the commission fees we are committed to pay each host location, and the ability to cancel the contract upon notice after a certain period of time. We strive to provide direct and indirect benefits to our host locations that are superior to, or competitive with, other providers or systems or alternative uses of the floor space that our kiosks occupy. If we are unable to provide our host retailers with adequate benefits, we may be unable to maintain or renew our contractual relationships on acceptable terms, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
 
If we cannot execute on our renewable energy strategy.
 
Our strategy is based upon leveraging our core competencies in the renewable energy space and relationships with certain land surveyors and mineral distributors and refiners. To be competitive, we need to locate, develop, or otherwise provide, sought after minerals and service offerings that are accepted by the market and establish third-party relationships necessary to develop and commercialize such product and service offerings. We are exploring new businesses to enter, and new products and services to offer, however, the complexities and structures of these new businesses could create conflicting priorities, constrain limited resources, and negatively impact our core businesses. We may use our financial resources and managements’ time and focus to invest in other companies’ offerings in the renewable energy sector, or we may seek to grow businesses organically.  We may enter into joint ventures through which we may expand our offerings. 
 
Litigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions, investigations or other legal proceedings could result in material rulings, decisions, settlements, fines, penalties or publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our industry has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, party to class actions, regulatory actions, investigations, arbitration, mediation and other legal proceedings. The outcome of such proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs, regulatory bodies or other parties may seek very large or indeterminate amounts of money from us or substantial restrictions on our business activities, and the results, including the magnitude, of lawsuits, actions, settlements, decisions and investigations may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise finalize lawsuits, regulatory actions, investigations, arbitrations, mediations or other legal proceedings may be significant and such proceedings may divert management’s time. In addition, there may be adverse publicity associated with any such developments that could decrease consumer acceptance of our products and services. As a result, litigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions or investigations involving us may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
3
 
 
We are subject to substantial federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulation specific to our business.
 
Our business is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulation, including those relating to copyright law, federal and state laws around rare earths and the renewable energy sector, The application of existing laws and regulations, changes in laws or enactment of new laws and regulations, that apply, or may in the future apply, to our current or future products or services, changes in governmental authorities’ interpretation of the application of various government regulations to our business, or the failure or inability to gain and retain required permits and approvals could materially and adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, many jurisdictions require us to obtain certain licenses in connection with the operations of our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be granted all necessary licenses or permits in the future, that current licenses or permits will be renewed or that regulators will not revoke current licenses or permits. Given the unique nature of our business and new products and services we may develop or acquire in the future, the application of various laws and regulations to our business is uncertain. Further, as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and action with regard to many aspects of our business increase, we expect that our costs of complying with the applicable legal requirements may increase, perhaps substantially.
 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or permits, loss of approved status, termination of contracts, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability. The occurrence of one or more of these events, as well as the increased cost of compliance, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
If we cannot manage our growth effectively, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
As we begin to scale our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations-
 
This growth may place significant demands on our operational, financial and administrative infrastructure and our management. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we anticipate the need to integrate, as appropriate, and improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, both those relating to providing attractive and efficient consumer products and services and those relating to our administration and internal systems, processes and controls. This integration and expansion of our administration, processes, systems and infrastructure may require us to commit and will continue to cause us to commit, substantial financial, operational and technical resources to managing our business.
 
Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management and operational resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization, including otherwise effectively growing our business lines, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
 
We may not have the ability to pay interest on our Notes, to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change or to settle conversions of the Notes, as may be required.
 
If a fundamental change occurs under the indenture governing our Notes, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, upon satisfaction of certain conversion conditions (including conditions outside of our control, such as market price or trading price) and proper conversion of the Notes by a holder, we will be required to make cash payments. Depending on the amount and timing of the payment requirements, we may not have been able to meet all of the obligations relating to Note conversions, which could have had a material adverse effect.
 
4
 
 
Further, if we fail to pay interest on, carry out the fundamental change repurchase obligations relating to, or make payments (including cash) upon conversion of, the Notes, we will be in default under the indenture governing the Notes. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. If the repayment of indebtedness were to be accelerated, including after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not, among other things, have sufficient funds to repay indebtedness or pay interest on, carry out our repurchase obligations relating to, or make cash payments upon conversion of, the Notes.
 
Conversion of our convertible notes into common stock will result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
 
Upon satisfaction of certain conversion conditions (including conditions outside of our control, such as market price or trading price) and proper conversion of the Notes by a holder, we may be required to deliver shares of our common stock to a converting holder. If additional shares of our common stock are issued due to conversion of some or all of the outstanding Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted. Further, any sales in the public market of any shares of common stock issued upon conversion or hedging or arbitrage trading activity that develops due to the potential conversion of the Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
 
Competitive pressures could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The nature and extent of consolidations and bankruptcies, which often occur during or as a result of economic downturns, in markets where we install our kiosks, particularly the supermarket and other retailing industries, could adversely affect our operations, including our competitive position, as the number of installations and potential retail users of our kiosks could be significantly reduced. See the risk factor below entitled, “Events outside of our control, including the current economic environment, has negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, consumers’ use of our products and services.”
 
Our business can be adversely affected by severe weather, natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, power failures, telecommunication loss and terrorist attacks.
 
A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. While we have taken steps to protect the security of critical business processes and systems and have established certain back-up systems and disaster recovery procedures, any disruptions, whether due to inadequate back-up or disaster recovery planning, failures of information technology systems, interruptions in the communications network, or other factors, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition, our operational and financial performance is a direct reflection of consumer use of and the ability to operate and service our kiosks used in our business. Severe weather, natural disasters and other events beyond our control can, for extended periods of time, significantly reduce consumer use of our products and services as well as interrupt the ability of our employees and third-party providers to operate and service our kiosks.
 
Our failure to meet consumer expectations with respect to pricing our products and services may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
Demand for our products and services may be sensitive to pricing changes. We evaluate and update our pricing strategies from time to time and changes we institute may have a significant impact on, among other things, our revenue and net income (loss).

Risks Related to our Securities
 
Since our common stock is thinly traded it is more susceptible to extreme rises or declines in price, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price paid.
 
Since our common stock is thinly traded, its trading price is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
 
     ●    trading volume of our shares;
 
     ●    number of securities analysts, market-makers and brokers following our common stock;
 
     ●    changes in, or failure to achieve, financial estimates by securities analysts;
 
     ●    new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors;
 
     ●    actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;
 
     ●    conditions or trends in our business industries;
 
     ●    announcements by us of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
 
     ●    additions or departures of key personnel;
 
     ●    sales of our common stock; and
 
     ●    general stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-traded, and particularly microcap, companies.
 
The stock markets often experience significant price and volume changes that are not related to the operating performance of individual companies, and because our common stock is thinly traded it is particularly susceptible to such changes. These broad market changes may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of how well we perform as a company. In addition, securities class action litigation has often been initiated following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial legal fees, potential liabilities and the diversion of management’s attention and resources from our business. Moreover, our shares are currently quoted on the OTC Pink and, further, are subject to the penny stock regulations. Price fluctuations in such shares are particularly volatile and subject to manipulation by market-makers, short-sellers and option traders.
 
Our common stock may be considered “penny stock”, further reducing its liquidity.
 
Our common stock may be considered “penny stock”, which will further reduce the liquidity of our common stock. Our common stock is likely to fall under the definition of “penny stock,” trading in the common stock is limited because broker-dealers are required to provide their customers with disclosure documents prior to allowing them to participate in transactions involving the common stock. These disclosure requirements are burdensome to broker-dealers and may discourage them from allowing their customers to participate in transactions involving our common stock, thereby further reducing the liquidity of our common stock.
 
“Penny stocks” are equity securities with a market price below $5.00 per share other than a security that is registered on a national exchange, included for quotation on the NASDAQ system or whose issuer has net tangible assets of more than $2,000,000 and has been in continuous operation for greater than three years. Issuers who have been in operation for less than three years must have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,000.
 
Rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act require broker-dealers engaging in transactions in penny stocks, to first provide to their customers a series of disclosures and documents including:
 
     ●    A standardized risk disclosure document identifying the risks inherent in investment in penny stocks;
 
     ●    All compensation received by the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction; and
 
     ●    Current quotation prices and other relevant market data; and Monthly account statements reflecting the fair market value of
           the
           securities.
 
These rules also require that a broker-dealer obtain financial and other information from a customer, determine that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for such customer and deliver a written statement to such customer setting forth the basis for this determination.

Investors should not anticipate receiving cash dividends on our common stock, thereby depriving investors of yield on their investment.
 
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our common stock and intend to retain future earnings, if any, to support our operations and to finance expansion. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. Such failure to pay a dividend will deprive investors of any yield on their investment in our common stock.
 
Our indemnification of officers and directors and limitations on their liability could limit our recourse against them.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain broad indemnification and liability limiting provisions regarding our officers, directors and employees, including the limitation of liability for certain violations of fiduciary duties. Stockholders therefore will have only limited recourse against these individuals.
 
If we fail to implement and maintain proper and effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and public reports could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.
 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Company to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We have identified our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that material weaknesses exists in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses consist of an insufficient complement of qualified accounting personnel and controls associated with segregation of duties and ineffective controls associated with identifying and accounting for complex and non-routine transactions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, there may be errors in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and in the accompanying footnote disclosures that could require restatements. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and disclosure, which could negatively impact our stock price.
 
We do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 
We have additional common stock and preferred stock available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 600,000,000 shares of our common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The common stock and the preferred stock can be issued by the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval. As of September 24, 2021, there were 226,604,039 shares of our common stock outstanding. Further, as of September 24, 2021, there were convertible notes outstanding that can be converted into approximately 113 million shares of our common stock.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans
 
On July 22, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and on July 26, 2011, stockholders holding a majority of shares of the Company approved, by written consent, the Plan and the issuance under the Plan of 5,000,000 shares. On November 16, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 10,000,000 shares to be made available for issuance under the Plan. Accordingly, the total number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Plan is 15,000,000 shares. Awards may be granted to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors of the Company and its related companies. Such options may be designated at the time of grant as either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Stock based compensation includes expense charges related to all stock-based awards. Such awards include options, warrants and stock grants. Generally, the Company issues stock options that vest over three years and expire in 5 to 10 years.

The Company records share based payments under the provisions of FASB ASC 718. Stock based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on certain assumptions. The Company estimated the expected volatility based on data used by peer group of public companies. The expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate assumption was determined using the equivalent U.S. Treasury bonds yield over the expected term. The Company has never paid any cash dividends and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company assumed an expected dividend yield of zero.
 
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2020 regarding equity compensation plans under which the equity securities are authorized for issuance.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Certain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements”. Except for the historical information contained herein, this report contains forward-looking statements (identified by the words “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “hope,” “strategy” and similar expressions), which are based on our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those discussed under Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and those described herein that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements, and the following:
 
     ●    Our limited operating history with our business model;
           
     ●    The low cash balance and limited financing currently available to us. We may in the near future have a number of obligations
           that we will be unable to meet without generating additional income or raising additional
           capital;
           
     ●    Further cost reductions or curtailment in future operations due to our low cash balance and negative cash flow;
           
     ●    Our ability to effect a financing transaction to fund our operations which could adversely affect the value of our stock;
           
     ●    Our limited cash resources may not be sufficient to fund continuing losses from operations;
           
     ●    The failure of our products and services to achieve market acceptance; and
           
     ●    The inability to compete in our market, especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and
           financial
           resources.
 
The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report.
 
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations. The Company focused on implementing a new operational direction. After a thorough evaluation process, the Company found that there is a substantial long-term demand for specific commodities relating to battery and new energy technologies. This presents a timely and unique opportunity based on rising demand characteristics. By capitalizing on market trends and current sustainable energy government mandates and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, we will focus on bringing a vertically-integrated solution to market. 
 
Results of Operations
 
For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
 
Revenue
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had no revenue, compared to revenues of $80,233 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue was due to asset sale (see note 1), resulting in no sales activity during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
10
 
 
Cost of Goods Sold
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had no cost of goods sold compared to cost of goods sold $88,965 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2019 was (11)%, The decrease in 2020 was because all inventory was liquidated during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 prior to the sale of the MiniMelts assets (see Note 1).
 
Selling Expenses
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had no selling expenses, compared to $143,323 during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company expensed $115,000 for sponsorship and media commitment fees in connection with the Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had no sales and there were no fees recorded under the agreement with MLB as it expired on December 31, 2019.
 
General and Administrative Expenses
 
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $245,813, a decrease of $575,309 or 70%, compared to $821,122 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to decrease in in stock compensation expenses and professional fees as a result of our reduction in operations as we contemplated our business restructuring.
 
Gain on Settlement of Liability
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a gain on settlement of liabilities of $156,709. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on settlement of liabilities of $11,000.
 
Loss on Asset Impairment
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $192,705. No such impairments were noted during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Gain on Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the amount $34,986, as compared to a loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $3,069,702 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Amortization of Debt Discount and Deferred Financing Costs
 
Amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $171,513, compared to $4,432 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The majority of the debt discount was fully amortized at December 31, 2019, leaving only a minimal amount remaining to be amortized during 2020. At December 31, 2020, there was $0 in unamortized debt discount.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $622,797, as compared to $611,294 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Gain on Sale of Asset
 
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company sold certain equipment and recorded $12,074 and $27,465, respectively, in loss on sale of assets.
 
11
 
 
Net Loss
 
As a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,896,150 as compared to $3,932,313 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company had net loss of $3,932,313 during the year ended December 31, 2020, has accumulated losses totaling $18,130,455, and has a working capital deficit of $8,117,241 at December 31, 2020. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
 
The Company will need to raise additional financing in order to fund their operations for the next 12 months, and to allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing.
 
Operating Activities
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used $40,394 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of the Company’s net loss of $3,932,313, offset by change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $3,069,702, loss on sale of asset of $12,074, share-based compensation of $5,772, $4,432 in amortization and accretion of debt discount, gain on settlement of liabilities of $11,000, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $810,939.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company used $751,637 of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of the Company’s net loss of $1,896,150, offset by gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $34,986, loss on sale of asset of $27,465, loss on asset impairment of $192,705, share-based compensation of $285,379, $100,188 in depreciation expense, $171,513 in amortization and accretion of debt discount, loss on default of convertible notes of $42,625, gain of settlement of debt $156,709 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $516,333.

The Company used $296,508 in repayments of promissory notes, $64,300 in repayment of convertible notes, and $189,936 in repayments of capital lease obligations.
 
12
 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on its financial condition, financial statements, revenues or expenses.
 
Inflation
 
Although the Company’s operations are influenced by general economic conditions, it does not believe that inflation had a material effect on its results of operations during the last two years as it is generally able to pass the increase in material and labor costs to its customers or absorb them as it improves the efficiency of its operations.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events different from those assumptions. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; estimating therefore, requires the exercise of judgment. Thus, accounting estimates change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired or as additional information is obtained. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
 
     ●    Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
           assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities
           occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
           basis
 
     ●    Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for
           substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that the Company
           values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the
           term of the derivative instruments, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which
           transactions are executed in the
           marketplace.
 
     ●    Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
           measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). Level 3
           instruments include derivative warrant instruments. The Company does not have sufficient corroborating evidence to support
           classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 1 or Level
           2.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants issued by the Company contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (Formerly U-Vend, Inc. and Subsidiaries)
 
 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BoxScore Brands, Inc. (the Company) (Formerly U-Vend Inc, Inc. and Subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
Substantial Doubt About the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s has suffered recurring losses from operations since inception and, as of December 31, 2019, has negative working capital and a stockholders’ deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
BoxScore Brands, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BoxScore Brands, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
Going Concern Considerations
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses since inception and has not achieved profitable operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Critical Audit Matter
 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Going Concern – Disclosure
 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. As noted in “Going Concern Considerations” above, the Company has a history of recurring net losses, a significant accumulated deficit and currently has net working capital deficit. At December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $18,130,455. The Company has contractual obligations, such as commitments for repayments of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, convertible notes payable, and amounts due under capital lease (collectively “obligations”). Currently, management’s forecasts and related assumptions illustrate their ability to meet the obligations through management of expenditures, implementation of a new operational direction, obtaining additional debt financing, and issuance of capital stock for additional funding to meet its operating needs. Should there be constraints on the ability to implement its new business operations or access financing through stock issuances, the Company will continue to manage cash outflows and meet the obligations through debt financing.
 
We identified management’s assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter. Management made judgments to conclude that it is probable that the Company’s plans will be effectively implemented and will provide the necessary cash flows to fund the Company’s obligations as they become due. Specifically, the judgments with the highest degree of impact and subjectivity in determining it is probable that the Company’s plans will be effectively implemented include its ability to manage expenditures, its ability to access funding from the capital market, its ability to obtain debt financing, and the successful implementation of its new operational direction. Auditing the judgments made by management required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort.
 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included the following, among others: (i) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to access funding from the capital market; (ii) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to manage expenditures (iii) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to obtain debt financing, and (iv) evaluating the planned implementation of its new business operational direction.

BOXSCORE BRANDS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
 
Note 1 – Nature of the Business
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations. The Company focused on implementing a new operational direction. After a thorough evaluation process, the Company found that there is a substantial long-term demand for specific commodities relating to battery and new energy technologies. This presents a timely and unique opportunity based on rising demand characteristics. By capitalizing on market trends and current sustainable energy government mandates and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, we will focus on bringing a vertically-integrated solution to market.
 
Asset Sale
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved an asset sale of the assets related to the legacy MiniMelts brand for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of its stockholders. These MiniMelts assets generated 100% of the revenue reported during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, MiniMelts sales accounted for approximately $1,100,000, or 85%, of the revenue reported during that period. Part of the proceeds from the sale was used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes.
 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s fiscal year ends is December 31.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BoxScore Brands, Inc. and the operations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries U-Vend America, Inc., U-Vend Canada, Inc. and U-Vend USA LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events different from those assumptions. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; estimating, therefore, requires the exercise of judgment. Thus, accounting estimates change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, or as additional information is obtained.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. Equipment has estimated useful lives between three and seven years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
 
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.
 
F-9
 
 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Basic earnings per share reflect the actual weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed including the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares had been issued. In a loss period, the calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share is considered to be the same, as the impact of potential common shares is anti-dilutive.
 
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, there were approximately 166 million and 160 million shares, respectively, potentially issuable under convertible debt agreements, options, and warrants that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the Company’s losses during the periods presented.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants issued by the Company contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
 
     ●    Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
           assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities
           occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
           basis
 
     ●    Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for
           substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that the Company
           values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term
           of the derivative instruments, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which transactions
           are executed in the
           marketplace.
 
     ●    Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
           measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 instruments
           include derivative warrant instruments. The Company does not have sufficient corroborating evidence to support classifying
           these assets and liabilities as Level 1 or Level
           2.
 
F-10
 
 
Certain of the Company’s debt and equity instruments include embedded derivatives that require bifurcation from the host contract under the provisions of ASC 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging.” Certain warrants were issued between June 2013 and December 2014 were derivative liabilities outside the exception of applying ASU 2017-11, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features.” When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-11 on its consolidated financial statements and reclassified $118,675 as equity from derivative liabilities. The estimated fair value of the derivative warrant instruments was calculated using a Black Scholes valuation model.
 
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” that requires all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, and non-employees to be measured at grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued, and recognized as expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally equivalent to the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The measurement date for the non-forfeitable awards to nonemployees that vest immediately is the date the award is issued.
 
Gain on Settlement of Liabilities
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020 creditors forgave aggregate amount of $11,000 associated with accrued expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019 creditors forgave aggregate amount of $156,709, of which approximately $64,000 were associated accrued expenses, $45,000 related to conversion of approximately $105,000 of accounts payable to a $60,000 convertible note, and $47,000 was connected to forgiveness of accounts payable.
 
Other Amounts due to Related Parties
 
Amounts due from related parties represent past amounts owed for compensation and operating expenses paid by the related party on behalf of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reclassified approximately $185,000 from due to related parties to accrued expenses, as a result of the individual no longer being an officer of the Company during 2019, and paid net $63,370 to related parties, resulting in a balance of $67,022 owed at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, this amount was reclassed to accrued expenses.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenue is recognized at the time each vending transaction occurs, the payment method is approved, and the product is disbursed from the machine. Wholesale revenue, including revenue earned under contracts with major sports organizations, are recognized at the time the products are delivered to the customer based on the agreement with the customer. We recognize revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control for promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue recognition principles, an entity is required to identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied (i.e., either over time or at a point in time). ASC 606 further requires that companies disclose sufficient information to enable readers of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
 
F-11
 
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the liability method, future tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized, or the liability settled.
 
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax law and rates on the date of enactment.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception, (ASU 2017-11).” Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2017-11 on its consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption the Company derecognized 39,512,502 number of warrants based on review of contracts that determined the derivative treatment was specific to a feature in the instrument that reduced the strike price if the Company issued additional shares for an amount less than the strike price. As a result of this analysis the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $118,675 on January 1, 2019.
 
The Company has examined all other recent accounting pronouncements and determined that they will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Note 3 – Going Concern
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company reported net loss of $3,932,313 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and has incurred accumulated losses totaling $18,130,455 through December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company has incurred negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. The Company has relied on the proceeds from loans and private sales of its stock, in addition to its revenues, to finance its operations. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
 
With the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic, the reduction of foot traffic and closure of retail locations, management has been proactively looking at new business models and opportunities to stabilize revenues and continue to grow the company. Until the Company can generate significant cash from operations, its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. The Company hopes to raise additional financing, potentially through the sale of debt or equity instruments, or a combination, to fund its operations for the next 12 months and allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. These conditions have raised substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements, which has not been alleviated.

At December 31, 2020, the Company has available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $11.9 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Of the federal net operating loss carryforward, $8.6 million, if not utilized earlier, expires through 2037 and $3.3 million will carryforward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire through 2040, if not utilized earlier. Due to the uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and utilize the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset the net operating loss carryforwards, as well as the total net deferred tax assets.
 
Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“Section 382”) imposes limitations on the availability of a company’s net operating losses and other corporate tax attributes as certain significant ownership changes occur. As a result of the historical equity instrument issuances by the Company, a Section 382 ownership change may have occurred and a study will be required to determine the date of the ownership change, if any. The amount of the Company’s net operating losses and other tax attributes incurred prior to any ownership change may be limited based on the Company’s value. A full valuation allowance has been established for the Company’s deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and any other corporate tax attributes.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no unrecognized uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized uncertain tax positions in tax expense.
 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as the states of California, Florida, Illinois and New York. The tax years 2017-2020 generally remain open to examination by the U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. In addition, the 2016 tax year is still open to examination by the state of California.

ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the chief executive officer and our chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s chief executive officer also acting as chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes using the 2013 COSO framework, an integrated framework for the evaluation of internal controls issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, to identify the risks and control objectives related to the evaluation of our control environment.
 
Our chief executive officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that material weaknesses exist in our internal control over financial reporting based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.
 
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weakness as of December 31, 2020: insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting. Because of this material weakness, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020.
 
14
 
 
To remediate our internal control weakness, management intends to implement the following measures:
 
     ●    Add sufficient accounting personnel or outside consultants to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate
           preparation of the financial
           statements.
 
     ●    Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel or outside consultants, develop and maintain adequate written accounting
           policies and
           procedures.
 
To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analyses and other post-closing procedures and retained the services of a consultant to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
 
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation requirements by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the year ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
 
The design of any system of control is based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all future events, no matter how remote, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may not deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Directors Compensation
 
The Company’s non-employee directors do not currently receive cash compensation for their services as directors although they are provided reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board meetings. In order to attract and retain qualified persons to our Board, in July 2011, the Company granted its non-employee directors stock options through its Equity Incentive Plan. During 2011, each non-employee director received 2,500 stock options at an exercise price of $60.00, vesting equally over a three year period, and with an expiration date of ten years from date of grant. In 2015, the Company granted each of its non-employee directors 500,000 stock options at an exercise price of $0.20, one third of the options vesting immediately and the balance over a two year period, and with an expiration date of five years from the date of grant.
 
Equity Incentive Plan
 
On July 22, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and on July 26, 2011, stockholders holding a majority of shares of the Company approved, by written consent, the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of options intended to qualify as “incentive stock options” and “non-statutory stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, together with the grant of bonus stock and stock appreciation rights, at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Incentive stock options are issuable only to our eligible officers, directors and key employees. Non-statutory stock options are issuable only to our non-employee directors and consultants. Upon stockholder approval of the Plan, a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock or appreciation rights may be issued under the Plan. The Plan will be administered by our full Board of Directors. Under the Plan, the Board will determine which individuals shall receive options, grants or stock appreciation rights, the time period during which the rights may be exercised, the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the rights and the option price. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 2,500 options outstanding under the Plan to employees, directors and outside consultants.
 
On November 22, 2017, stockholders of the Company holding a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock approved, by written consent, an increase in the number of shares reserved under the Plan by 10,000,000 shares. After this increase of 10,000,000 shares, the total number of shares of common stock reserved under the Plan totals 15,000,000 shares. On November 16, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the increase of the 10,000,000 shares reserved under the Plan.
 
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that liability of directors to us for monetary damages is eliminated to the full extent provided by Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a director is not personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) for authorizing the unlawful payment of a dividend or other distribution on our capital stock or the unlawful purchases of our capital stock; (iv) a violation of Delaware law with respect to conflicts of interest by directors; or (v) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit.
 
The effect of this provision in our Certificate of Incorporation is to eliminate our rights and our stockholders’ rights (through stockholders’ derivative suits) to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director (including any breach resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior) except in the situations described in clauses (i) through (v) above. This provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the rights of our security holders to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director’s duty of care or any liability for violation of the federal securities laws.

ITEM 13 - CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
 
Director Independence
 
As our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink, we are not subject to the rules of any national securities exchange which require that a majority of a listed company’s directors and specified committees of the board of directors meet independence standards prescribed by such rules. However, we consider a majority of our Board members (consisting of Messrs. Hentschel, White and Levinthal) to be independent directors under NYSE American stock exchange rules.
