UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited - Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

  

1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

 

Business Description:

 

ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and AV streaming solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability.

 

Basis of Presentation:

 

The fiscal year for ClearOne is the twelve months ending on December 31. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

 

These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited. Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. 

 

Significant Accounting Policies:

 

The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to these policies during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.



Recent accounting pronouncements:



In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” on the topic of income taxes. The standard requires additional disclosure for income taxes. These requirements include: (i) requiring a public entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation; (ii) disclosure of additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate); (iii) annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes; (iv) annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received); (v) annual disclosure of income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (vi) annual disclosure of income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. For public entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company will adopt this guidance in fiscal 2025 and is in the process of evaluating the new requirements. As a result, the Company has not yet determined the impact this new ASU will have on its disclosures.



The Company has determined that recently issued accounting standards, other than the above discussed, will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

 

                                                                   7

Liquidity:

 

As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $18,544 compared to $17,835 as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital was $21,395 as of March 31, 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $433 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $59,888 compared to $60,321 of cash was provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company believes, although there can be no assurance, that the current cash position and effective management of working capital, will provide the liquidity needed to meet our operating needs through at least May 17, 2025. The Company also believes that its strong portfolio of intellectual property and its solid brand equity in the market will enable it to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet its short and long-term financing needs; however, there can be no assurance that, if needed, the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary funds through equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. If the Company needs additional capital and is unable to secure financing, it may be required to further reduce expenses, or delay product development and enhancement.

3. Loss Per Share

 

Loss per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Stock options, warrants and the convertible portion of senior convertible notes are considered to be potential common stock. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

 

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect. 



The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share:

Debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2024 were not deemed impaired at acquisition and subsequent declines in fair value are not deemed attributed to declines in credit quality. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the securities will receive a full recovery of par value, although there can be no assurance that such recovery will occur. The available-for-sale marketable securities with continuous gross unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

Long-term inventory represents inventory held in excess of our current (next 12 months) requirements based on our recent sales and forecasted level of sales. We expect to sell the above inventory, net of reserves, at or above the stated cost and believe that no loss will be incurred on its sale, although there can be no assurance of the timing or amount of any sales. 

 

Net loss incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value and write-off of obsolete inventory for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Issue of Common Stock and Warrants



On September 12, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers named therein, pursuant to which the Company issued 3,623,189 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share at an offering price of $2.76 per share. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $10,000 and net proceeds of $9,288 after deducting placement agent fees and related offering expenses. In a concurring private placement the Company also issued to the same purchasers warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 3,623,189 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.76 per share. Each warrant became immediately exercisable and will expire on March 15, 2027. 



On January 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Edward D. Bagley, an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement 1,538,461 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price of $1.30 per share of Common Stock. The consideration for the Shares is the cancellation and termination of Mr. Bagley’s outstanding bridge loan to the Company in the principal amount of $2,000 originally issued on July 2, 2021 and amended and restated on September 11, 2021. Mr. Bagley is an affiliate of the Company and the Company’s single largest stockholder.

9. Share-based Compensation

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 217,810 options with contractual lives of ten years and 370,000 options with contractual lives of six years offered under the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), which was restated and approved by the shareholders on December 12, 2015. As of March 31, 2024, the 2007 Plan had 857,044 authorized unissued options.

 

The Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of the share-based payments on the date of grant using an option-pricing model with assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the risk-free interest rate of the awards, the expected life of the awards, the expected volatility over the term of the awards, and the expected dividends of the awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of share-based payments granted under the guidelines of ASC Topic 718. 

 

In applying the Black-Scholes methodology to 160,000 options granted in June 2023, the Company used the following assumptions: 

 

Risk free interest rate, average                              3.91% 

Expected option life, average                               5 years 

Expected price volatility, average                           91.47% 

Expected dividend yield                                          0%

10. Income Taxes

 

The Company recorded a full valuation allowance against U.S Federal and State deferred tax assets, which results in no income tax benefit for losses in these jurisdictions. The full domestic valuation allowance was recorded as management concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets are not realizable due to the Company's recent pre-tax losses and other sources of negative evidence. Provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 mostly represents income tax expense (benefit) recorded for jurisdictions outside the United States.



The Company had approximately $968 of uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not possible to forecast the payment of this liability for any particular year, therefore, it is reflected in other long-term liabilities.



11. Fair Value Measurements

 

The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 

 

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

 

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled. 

 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs. 

 

The Company’s financial instruments are valued using observable inputs. The following table sets forth the fair value of the financial instruments re-measured by the Company as of March 31, 2024:

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

 

ClearOne is a global Company that designs, develops and sells conferencing, collaboration, and AV networking solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer a high level of functionality, reliability and scalability. We derive a major portion of our revenue from audio conferencing products and microphones by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel. We have extended our total addressable market from the installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets – microphones, video collaboration and AV networking. We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development. 



                                                                   17

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

On March 11, 2024, we announced a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share of ClearOne common stock, payable on April 10, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 2, 2024.

On January 23, 2024 we launched the DIALOG® 20 USB wireless microphone system at Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) 2024, a major global audiovisual expo. ClearOne’s booth at ISE 2024 recorded a 319% increase in unique visitors compared to the number of unique visitors the Company’s booth recorded in 2023. The DIALOG® UVHF Wireless Microphone System also received AV Technology Magazine’s Best in Show award at ISE 2024, having previously garnered other notable industry awards in 2023.

We continued our programs to cut costs and to speed up product development that we believe will enable us to get back to a growth path.

Overall revenue decreased by 13% in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from the audio conferencing category. The revenue decline was also caused by significantly reduced demand for our products in many regions including USA, Europe and China when compared to 2023-Q1 revenues. We believe this revenue decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of past production shortages. We believe that lack of product availability has caused some of our channel partners to purchase and install competing brands. Historically, we have seen a lag of several months between the time that our professional conferencing products are specified for installation and the date when those products are installed. Since our product availability was constrained through a significant part of Q4 2023, we believe our revenue could be impacted negatively by these market dynamics through much of Q2 2024. We have also faced sales headwinds from our products’ lack of Microsoft Teams certification, despite their longtime functional compatibility with this platform. Our work through early 2024 has focused on mitigating these impacts through maintaining consistent dialogues, product demonstrations, and feedback cycles with end users and channel partners, along with improving our visibility at key industry events. We believe our revenue performance in 2024-Q1 also was to a small extent impacted negatively due to increased costs associated with electronic raw materials that have affected the global manufacturing of high tech products. We expect these increased costs in various degrees to continue through 2024 and 2025.

Our gross profit margin increased to 31.8% during the first quarter of 2024 from 31.5% during the first quarter of 2023. The marginal increase in gross profit is mainly due to savings in freight cost wherein air shipments were reduced and replaced by ocean shipments wherever feasible.

Net loss increased from $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in net loss was mainly due to (a) a decrease in revenues partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and (b) a recognition of $1.35 million from a one-time legal settlement of a contract dispute in first quarter of 2023.

We believe, although there can be no assurance, that we can return to generating operating profits through our strategic initiatives namely product innovation and cost reduction.

Industry conditions

We operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry which is dominated on the one hand by a few players with respect to certain products like traditional video conferencing appliances while on the other hand influenced heavily by a fragmented reseller market consisting of numerous regional and local players. The industry is also characterized by venture capitalist-funded start-ups and private companies willing to fund cumulative cash losses in order to gain market share and achieve certain non-financial goals. It has become increasingly important to have higher interoperability with other products in the audio visual market as well as certifications from leading video conferencing service providers like Microsoft and Zoom.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Economic conditions, challenges and risks

 

The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors vary within each product category. Our installed professional audio conferencing products, which is our flagship product category, continue to be ahead of the competition despite the reduction in revenues. Our strength in this space is largely due to our fully integrated suite of products consisting of DSP mixers, wide range of professional microphone products and video collaboration products. Despite our strong leadership position in the installed professional audio conferencing market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the limited size of the market, pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market due to higher margins, and the lack of certifications from Microsoft. Notably, the Microsoft Teams device certification program is closed to new meeting room devices and solutions. Although we have requested admission into this certification program on multiple occasions ClearOne has been denied admission by Microsoft so far.



Our video products and beamforming microphone arrays, especially highly advanced BMA 360 and BMA-CT are critical to our long-term growth. We face intense competition in this market from well-established market leaders as well as emerging players rich with marketing funds. We expect our strategy of making our products more interoperable with other audio-visual products, continuing to improve the quality of our high-end audio conferencing products and microphones, and offering a wide range of innovative professional cameras will generate growth in the near future. 

 

We derive a significant portion of our revenue (approximately 70% in the first three months of 2024) from international operations and expect this trend to continue in the future. Most of our revenue from outside the U.S. is billed in U.S. dollars and is not exposed to any significant currency risk. However, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk if the U.S. dollar is strong against other currencies as it will make U.S. Dollar denominated prices of our products less competitive.

 

Deferred Product Revenue

 

Deferred product revenue decreased to $26 thousand on March 31, 2024 compared to $30 thousand on December 31, 2023.

 

A detailed discussion of our results of operations follows below.

Revenue

 

Our revenue decreased to $3.6 million in 2024-Q1 compared to $4.2 million in 2023-Q1 due to a 35% decline in audio conferencing and a 19% decline in video products, offset by a 31% increase in microphones. Except for BMA all other product categories suffered revenue declines year over year. Our traditional ceiling mics, personal audio conferencing products, and video cameras suffered revenue declines due to lack of demand. During the first quarter of 2024, revenues from Asia including India and the Middle East as a whole increased by 18% while all other regions suffered revenue loss. During 2024-Q1 revenues from Americas declined by 30% and from Europe and Africa declined significantly by 42%.

Cost of goods sold includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers, the repackaging of our products, our manufacturing and operations organization, property and equipment depreciation, warranty expense, freight expense, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expenses.



Our gross profit margin increased from 31.5% during 2023-Q1 to 31.8% during 2024-Q1. The marginal increase was due to saving in freight cost wherein air freight was controlled by replacing air freight with ocean freight.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Our profitability in the near-term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional installed audio-conferencing products. We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory, our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs. Our long-term inventory includes approximately $0.2 million of Converge Pro and Beamforming microphone array products, $1.0 million of cameras, and $1.6 million of raw materials that will be used primarily for manufacturing professional audio conferencing products and BMA microphones. Any business changes that are adverse to these product lines could potentially impact our ability to sell our long-term inventory in addition to our current inventory. 

 

Operating Expenses

 

Operating expenses include sales and marketing (“S&M”) expenses, research and product development (“R&D”) expenses and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses. Total operating expenses in 2024-Q1 was $3.2 million compared to $3.5 million in 2023-Q1. The following contains a more detailed discussion of expenses related to sales and marketing, research and product development, general and administrative, and other items. 

Sales and Marketing - S&M expenses include selling, customer service, and marketing expenses such as employee-related costs, allocations of overhead expenses, trade shows, and other advertising and selling expenses.

 

S&M expenses in 2024-Q1 increased marginally to $1.3 million from $1.2 million for 2023-Q1. The increase was primarily due to increase in trade-show related expenses.



Research and Product Development - R&D expenses include research and development, product line management, engineering services, and test and application expenses, including employee-related costs, outside services, expensed materials, depreciation, and an allocation of overhead expenses.

 

R&D expenses decreased to $0.9 million in 2024-Q1 compared to $1.0 million for 2023-Q1. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in legal expenses and project related expenses.

  

General and Administrative - G&A expenses include employee-related costs, professional service fees, allocations of overhead expenses, litigation costs, and corporate administrative costs, including costs related to finance and human resources teams.

 

G&A expenses decreased to $1.0 million in 2024-Q1 compared to $1.3 million in 2023-Q1. The reduction was primarily due to (a) a decrease in legal expenses, (b) and a decrease in insurance expenses, (c) and a reduction in employee related expenses.

 

Interest Expense



Interest expense decreased to $0.0 million in 2024-Q1 compared to $0.3 million in 2023-Q1. The interest expense declined due to repayment of all the debts in full in 2023.



                                                                   21

Other income (expense), net

 

Other income (expense), net includes interest income, foreign currency changes and gain or loss on disposal of assets. Other income for 2024-Q1 included $0.2 million of interest income received on marketable securities. Other income in 2023-Q1 included a receipt of $1.35 million from a one-time legal settlement of a contract dispute.

 

Provision for income taxes

 

During each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize any benefit from the losses incurred due to setting up a full valuation allowance.

 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $18.5 million compared to $17.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital was $21.4 million and $39.1 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $59.9 million from $60.3 million of net cash used by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in cash inflow was primarily due to $56.4 million in receipts from legal settlements, the receipt of $4.5 million from the return of a bond deposited with a court, and a $1.3 million refund of income taxes with interest in the three months ended March 31, 2023. These receipts were partially offset by operating losses.

 

Net cash provided by investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.3 million compared to $0.1 million of net cash used in investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in sale of marketable securities (net of purchases) by $0.3 million and an increase in purchase of property and equipment by $0.06 million. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of capitalized legal expenses of $0.03 million. 



Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.007 million compared to $2.2 million used in payments of principal amounts due on senior convertible debt in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $18.5 million compared to $17.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital was $21.4 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company believes, although there can be no assurance, that the current cash position and effective management of working capital, will provide the liquidity needed to meet our operating needs through at least May 17, 2025. The Company also believes that its strong portfolio of intellectual property and its solid brand equity in the market will enable it to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet its short and long-term financing needs; however, there can be no assurance that, if needed, the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary funds through equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. If the Company needs additional capital and is unable to secure financing, it may be required to further reduce expenses, or delay product development and enhancement.



As of March 31, 2024, we had open purchase orders of approximately $4.5 million mostly for the purchase of inventory.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had inventory totaling $15.6 million, of which non-current inventory accounted for $4.2 million. This compares to total inventories of $13.8 million, which includes non-current inventory of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

 

                                                                   22
