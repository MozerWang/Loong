We focus on digital publishing, advertising technology, consumer insights, creative and media services.



During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two business units of Big Village (Big Village Insights, Inc. and Big Village Agency LLC (together, referred to as the "Big Village Entities")), in an all-cash transaction funded by the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility (the "Big Village Acquisition"). 



Digital Publishing



Our digital publishing division focuses on developing content that attracts an audience and monetizes that audience through advertising. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families, and more broadly, women. The portfolio consists of popular websites including Mom.com, Cafemom.com, LittleThings.com, and MamasLatinas.com. This demographic is highly sought after by brands and their advertising agencies.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and in accordance with rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, such unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations. The consolidated results of operations for periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future periods. The consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023, was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report. 

Going Concern and Liquidity

Historically, the Company has incurred losses, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately $154.6 million as of March 31, 2024. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were $920,000 and $(1.0) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately a $13.3 million working capital deficit, inclusive of $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents.



The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its liquidity needs through a combination of factors. The Company is currently exploring several strategic alternatives, including restructuring or refinancing its debt, or seeking additional debt, including borrowing under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Agreement or raising equity capital. The ability to access the capital market is also dependent upon the stock volume and market price of the Company's stock, which cannot be assured. Other measures include reducing or delaying certain business activities, reducing general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount. The ultimate success of these plans is not guaranteed.



The Company's current cash and working capital, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is not expected to be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations over the next twelve months. As a result, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to meet its financial needs and continue as a going concern.



The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company exceeded the federally insured limit of $250,000 for interest and non-interest-bearing accounts.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

There were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Use of Estimates 



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Our consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.



Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, allowance for current expected credit losses, the determination of the relative selling prices of our services, percentage of completion for revenue recognition, estimates of amortization period for intangible assets, estimates of depreciation period for property and equipment, discount rates used in the valuation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, litigation reserves, the valuation of equity-based transactions, valuation of the Center Lane Senior Secured Facility carrying value regarding debt modification or extinguishment, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. While these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current events and actions that may affect us in the future, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Foreign Currency



We translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, which have a functional currency in the respective country’s local currency, to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and actual exchange rates for revenue, costs and expenses on the date of the transaction. Translation gains and losses as a result of consolidation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are included within “general and administrative expense” on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Concentrations of Credit Risk



Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high credit-quality financial institutions. Such deposits may be in excess of federally insured limits. In addition, the Company maintains various bank accounts in Thailand and Israel, with some level of insurance. We perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of financial institutions. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.



We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and require no collateral from our customers. We maintain an allowance for current expected credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable balances.



The Company generates revenue as follows:



•the selling of advertisements placed on our owned and managed sites and on partner websites where we earn a share of the revenue,

•facilitating the seamless, real-time exchange of advertisements on a large scale, bridging networks of buyers (referred to as "DSPs") and networks of sellers (referred to as "SSPs"),

•serving advertisers through providing access to premium resources and leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns, where revenue is derived from the planning and execution of creative and media marketing campaigns, and

•providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insights to address customers' strategic issues, where revenue is primarily derived from providing a single integrated service for such research.

Reclassification



As of and for the year ending December 31, 2023, certain amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. Changes were made for foreign currency translation from operating activities to showing the cash and cash equivalent impact only as a separate line item below financing activities, right of use asset and liability showing a net position instead showing a separate line item for asset and liabilities and reclassification on other operating activities line items for accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Changes were made for other expenses under finance income (expense), to general and administrative expense, which impacted our loss from operations.

These reclassifications had no impact on the previously reported net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Effective Accounting Pronouncements Adopted



In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The FASB reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock instruments and made certain disclosure amendments to improve the information provided to users. The new standard is effective January 1, 2024 (early adoption is permitted, but not earlier than January 1, 2021). This standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period March 31, 2024.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and if triggering events are noted prior to the annual assessment. Impairment is deemed to occur when the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit exceeds the implied value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit.



During the year ended December 31, 2023, an impairment assessment was performed on goodwill for the Ad Network, Owned & Operating and Insights reporting units. The assessment used a qualitative assessment which includes consideration of the economic, industry and market conditions in addition to the overall financial performance of the Company and these assets. Our qualitative assessment concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the Ad Network and Owned & Operating reporting units was less than the carrying value, hence, we performed a quantitative analysis. Our assessment for the Insights reporting unit did not have such a conclusion, hence a quantitative analysis was not required.



In a quantitative test, the fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis and further analyzed using other methods of valuation. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our long-term projections. Assumptions used in our impairment testing are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. Our discount rate is based on a market participant debt structure and cost of capital. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge of the reporting unit’s goodwill would be necessary. 



At December 31, 2023, our quantitative analysis showed that the implied fair value of our goodwill for the Ad Network and Owned & Operating reporting units was less than its carrying value which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $14.1 million. 



There was no triggering event or impairment for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

NOTE 10 – CENTRE LANE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY



Effective June 1, 2020, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire 100% of Wild Sky Media, a subsidiary of the Company (the “Purchase Agreement”). To finance this acquisition, the Company obtained a first lien senior secured credit facility from Centre Lane Partners Master Credit Fund II, L.P. (“Centre Lane Partners”) in the amount of $16.5 million, comprised of $15.0 million of initial indebtedness, repayment of Wild Sky’s existing accounts receivable factoring facility of approximately $900,000 and approximately $500,000 of expenses.



On April 4, 2023, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Centre Lane Partners, pursuant to which they would provide financing in the form of a senior secured credit facility for the acquisition of the Big Village Entities. 



On April 20, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into the Seventeenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Seventeenth Amendment”) with Centre Lane Partners. The Credit Agreement was amended, as provided in the Seventeenth Amendment, to provide for an additional term loan amount of $26.3 million to, among other things, finance the Acquisition. This term loan, which was provided by BV Agency, LLC, matures on April 20, 2026 and was issued at a discount of 5% or $1.3 million. Interest of 15% payable under the note is payable-in-kind in lieu of cash payment up to April 30, 2024, then 5% payable quarterly in cash and 10% payable-in-kind in lieu of cash payment until maturity of April 20, 2026.



As part of the Seventeenth Amendment, the Company is required to pay an amendment fee of 2% of the principal amount of the existing initial principal plus amendments one to eight ("First In Last Out Loans") and amendments nine to sixteen ("Last In First Out Loans"), totaling $706,000, additionally, an exit fee of $18,000 of the loan to finance the Big Village Acquisition. The outstanding principal on these at April 20, 2023 was $31.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively. These fees total $724,000 and are due and payable at maturity. Additionally, the maturity dates were extended to April 20, 2026.



Also, in connection with the Seventeenth Amendment, on April 20, 2023, the Company issued 21,401,993 shares of common stock of the Company to BV Agency, LLC, an entity beneficially owned by Centre Lane Partners. The shares valued $1.9 million, based on a per share price of $0.09, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock at close of market on April 19, 2023. The issuance of the shares of common stock were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. As of March 31, 2024, BV Agency, LLC and Centre Lane Partners own approximately 12.4% and 8.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively.



On July 28, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into the Nineteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Nineteenth Amendment”) with Centre Lane Partners. The Credit Agreement was amended, as provided in the Nineteenth Amendment, to provide for an additional term loan amount of $2.0 million to, among other things, finance the

integration and further growth of the Company post-Acquisition. This term loan is part of the last in first out loans and matures on June 28, 2024. 



Including the Nineteenth Amendment, Centre Lane Partners subsequently loaned the Company an additional $38.0 million to provide liquidity to fund operations beginning in April 2021 (as amended, the “Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility”). This Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility has been determined to qualify as a related party transaction as shares were issued to Centre Lane Partners as part of the transaction. A related party is a party that can exercise significant influence over the Company in making financial and/or operating decisions.



The original note issued under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility initially bore interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum, with payments of 2.5% of outstanding principal beginning on June 30, 2023.

amount of the original loan. As of March 31, 2024, there were nineteen amendments to the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility. 



Consistent with FASB ASC Topic 470 Debt, (“ASC 470”), the Company is required to perform an analysis of the change in each amendment to determine whether the change is a modification or an extinguishment of debt. Under a modification, no gain or loss is recorded, and a new effective interest rate is established based on the carrying value of the debt and revised cash flow. If the debt is extinguished, the old debt is derecognized and the new debt is recorded as fair value, which becomes the new carrying value. A gain or loss is recorded for the difference between the net carrying value of the original debt and the fair value of the new debt, additionally, in the event the transaction is with a related party, this gain or loss should be recognized against additional paid in capital. Interest expense is recorded based on the effective interest rate of the new debt. A debt is considered extinguished if the present value of the new cash flows under the term of the new debt is at least 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the old debt.



In connection with the Seventeenth Amendment, the Company determined that the change was an extinguishment consistent with ASC 470, Debt, the old debt of $35.5 million was derecognized and the new debt of $62.7 million was recognized at estimated fair value. A gain on extinguishment was recognized against additional paid in capital of $671,000, as Centre Lane Partners is a related party.

NOTE 15 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS



The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).



The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:



Level 1: Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are accessible at the reporting date. Because valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.



Level 2: Valuation is determined from pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Observable inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or

liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.



Level 3: Valuation is based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Level 3 inputs includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value generally require significant management judgment or estimation.

Fair Value Considerations



Financial instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of cash, accounts receivable, other liabilities and accounts payable. The Company believes that the carrying value of its current financial instruments approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 10% Convertible Promissory Note approximates the fair value due to their nature and level of risk.

The Company has certain non-financial assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when there is an indicator of impairment, and they are recorded at fair value only when impairment is recognized. These assets include goodwill and intangible assets, net.



The below table shows the quantitative information for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:

Goodwill and Intangibles Assets



Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, and if triggering events are noted prior to the annual assessment. Impairment is deemed to occur when the carrying value associated with the reporting unit exceeds the implied value associated with the reporting unit.



We estimated the fair value of our reporting units utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flow method), which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. 



Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility



The Company is required to perform an analysis of the change in each amendment to determine whether the change is a modification or an extinguishment of debt. Under a modification, no gain or loss is recorded, and a new effective interest rate is established based on the carrying value of the debt and revised cash flow. If the debt is extinguished, the old debt is derecognized and the new debt is recorded as fair value, which becomes the new carrying value.



Amendment seventeen was considered an extinguishment. The Company utilized a third party valuation company to calculate the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the amendment and determine if it was considered substantially different by at least a 10% difference from the present value of the remaining cash flow of the original debt instrument.

NOTE 16– COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation



In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Company, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. When a loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Company will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Company will then continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of any such accrued liability.

Ladenburg



On July 11, 2023, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. (“Ladenburg”) filed an action against the Company for breach of contract in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Case No. 9:23-cv-81019-AMC. Ladenburg alleges that it entered into an Investment Banking Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Company on September 1, 2020. According to Ladenburg, that Agreement provided that Ladenburg would be the exclusive investment advisor and banker for the Company. Ladenburg alleges that the Agreement entitles them to a fee for any financing transactions (debt financing or merger and acquisition transactions) that the Company engages in during the term of the contract. In April 2023, the Company informed Ladenburg of the impending Big Village Acquisition. Ladenburg now seeks $1.5 million, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees and expenses as a result of that acquisition and debt financing, claiming that it is entitled to a fee. The Company disputes the allegations and disputes that Ladenburg is entitled to receive any fee since it did not perform any work pertaining to such acquisition. The outcome of this matter is not determinable as of the date of issuance of these financial statements.

Other Litigation



Other litigation is defined as smaller claims or litigation that are neither individually nor collectively material. It does not include lawsuits that relate to collections.



The Company is party to various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, separate from normal course accounts receivable collections matters. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these litigations and other legal proceedings, the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of these matters, and it is reasonably possible that some of them could be resolved unfavorably to the Company. As a result, it is possible that the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular fiscal period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of pending litigation or contingencies. The outcome is not determinable as of the issuance of these financial statements.

Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Conversion or exercise of the potential common shares is not reflected in diluted earnings per share unless the effect is dilutive. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding common share equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method, and if-converted method, as applicable.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC.

Business Overview

Organization and Nature of Operations



Bright Mountain Media, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Bright Mountain” or “we”) has an end-to-end digital media and advertising services platform that efficiently connects brands with targeted consumer demographics. We focus on digital publishing, advertising technology, consumer insights, creative and media services. 



During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two business units of Big Village (Big Village Insights, Inc. and Big Village Agency LLC (together, referred to as the "Big Village Entities")), in an all-cash transaction funded by the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility (the "Big Village Acquisition"). 



Digital Publishing



Our digital publishing division focuses on developing content that attracts an audience and monetizes that audience through advertising. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families, and more broadly, women. The portfolio consists of popular websites including Mom.com, Cafemom.com, LittleThings.com, and MamasLatinas.com. This demographic is highly sought after by brands and their advertising agencies. We use internal and external technologies to constantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the content we create. Our publishing division monetizes its audiences through both direct and programmatic advertising sales. 



Advertising Technology



Our advertising technology division focuses on delivering targeted ads to audiences on owned and operated sites as well as third-party publishers in a cost-effective manner through the deployment of proprietary technologies. By developing our own proprietary technology stack, we are able to pass along efficiencies to both the demand and supply side of the ecosystem. Our goal is to enable and support a streamlined, end-to-end advertising model that addresses both demand (buy side) and publisher supply (sell side) programmatic sales and delivery of digital advertisements using an array of audience targeting tools and advertising formats (display, audio, video, CTV, in-app). Programmatic advertising relies on software programs that leverage data and proprietary algorithms to match the optimal selection of an ad with a bid price offered by advertisers.



Consumer Insights



Our consumer insights division focuses on providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insight to address customers' strategic issues. We provide cutting-edge and dynamic research, offering clients a comprehensive perspective on their consumers. This insight extends to strategic guidance on the optimal timing and channels to effectively connect with target audiences. Our cutting-edge approach combines advanced data analytics and comprehensive market research, to uncover actionable insights that drive informed decision-making.



Creative Services



Our creative services division transforms data into award-winning campaigns. We are uniquely able to leverage insights teams with highly strategic media planning and buying teams to ensure brands not only position their advertising precisely, but also yield impactful business results. Our goal is to combine data-driven decisions with creativity fueled by a deep understanding of modern culture.

Table of Contents

Media Services



Our media services division focuses on advertisers and agencies by providing access to premium inventory, leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns. Our aim is to empower clients to access the most sought-after advertising spaces across diverse platforms tailored to their specific needs and preferences. Our data-driven approach ensures that ad placements are not only well-targeted, but also continuously optimized for maximum efficiency and ROI. Our commitment to combining premium inventory access with data-driven programmatic campaign optimization makes us an indispensable partner in the success of our clients' advertising and marketing endeavors. 



The Company generates revenue through:



•the selling of advertisements placed on our owned and managed sites and on partner websites where we earn a share of the revenue;



•facilitating the seamless, real-time exchange of advertisements on a large scale, bridging networks of buyers (referred to as "DSPs") and networks of sellers (referred to as "SSPs");



•serving advertisers through providing access to premium resources and leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns, where revenue is derived from the planning and execution of creative and media marketing campaigns; and



•providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insights to address customers' strategic issues, where revenue is primarily derived from providing a single integrated service for such research. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance



Seasonal Fluctuations. Typically advertising technology companies report a material portion of their revenues during the third and fourth calendar quarter as a result of back-to-school and holiday-related advertising spend. We continue to experience this trend in our advertising technology division. Because of seasonal fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the results of any quarter or full year will be indicative of results for future years or quarters. 



Limited Number of Customers. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer represented 14.9% of revenue; there was no such concentration for the three months ended March 31, 2023.



Managing Industry Dynamics. We operate in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry. Advances in programmatic advertising technologies, and the efficient and automated method of purchasing ads online, has enabled publishers to auction their ad inventory to more buyers simultaneously, in real time. As advertisers stay ahead of evolving trends in consumer engagement with digital media, an expansive opportunity for innovation emerges. Our commitment to understanding customer needs empowers us, and our continuous pursuit of innovation enables swift adaptation to industry shifts. This approach not only facilitates the development of cutting-edge solutions, but also does so in a cost-effective manner. 



As regulatory concerns accelerate the impact on existing industry standards, companies are actively seeking new methods to finely tailor their messages to target audiences. Tech companies will be limited in how they monetize personal information for advertising purposes. This trend is exemplified by two imminent developments: (1) the anticipated erosion of Google's third-party cookies and (2) the data security measures integrated into Apple iPhones. Consequently, companies must explore innovative methods to better understand their target audiences and have the tools to effectively engage with them.

Revenue



Our revenue showed an overall increase of $10.9 million, or 731%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, which was driven by $9.4 million in revenue as a result of the Big Village Acquisition, and was partially offset by macroeconomic factors, coupled with an overall reduction in spending by some customers due to inflationary concerns, which led to lower than normal rates and lower earnings. The macroeconomic impacts significantly reduced direct sales by digital publishing customers as well as traffic on our website, which resulted in lower revenue in these divisions.

 administrative

 expense



General and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 53%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to a combination of factors as discussed below.



Personnel Cost



Personnel cost increased by approximately $747,000, or 43%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This change is mainly driven by an increase in head count as a result of the acquisition of the Big Village Entities during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in head count was partially offset by a decrease in the Company's head count by a net amount of 23 employees or 12%, including nine employees that were 

38





terminated as a reduction in force. The Company incurred severance cost of approximately $8,000 in connection with this reduction.



The Company incurred severance cost of approximately $122,000 associated with an headcount reduction during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Financing and other expense, net increased by $1.8 million, or 197%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was largely attributable to a $1.8 million increase in interest expense related to the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, which reflected higher principal and fees due to the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility amendments during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure



Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements and for use within management's discussion and analysis based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company's financial performance, but non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 



All of the items included in the reconciliation from net loss before taxes to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, etc.) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance (e.g., M&A costs, income taxes, gain on sale of investments, loss on disposal of assets, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the Company's operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business.



We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.



Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company's performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. The following table summarizes total current assets, total current liabilities and net working capital (deficit) as of March 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.





(in thousands)                                                                                     March 31, 2024   December 31, 2023

As of March 31, 2024, we had a cash balance of $4.9 million compared with a cash balance of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s liquidity needs, and a discussion of how it intends to meet those needs, is discussed below. See –“Going Concern.”



Going Concern

Historically, the Company has incurred losses, which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately $154.6 million as of March 31, 2024. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were $920,000 and $(1.0) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $13.3 million, inclusive of $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents.



The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its liquidity needs through a combination of factors. During the next year, we anticipate that we will need approximately $10.3 million to meet our contractual obligations in addition to amounts needed for our working capital needs. The Company is currently exploring several strategic alternatives, including restructuring or refinancing its debt, or seeking additional debt, including borrowing under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Agreement or raising equity capital. The ability to access the capital markets is also dependent upon the volume and market price of the Company's stock, which cannot be assured. Other measures include reducing or delaying certain business activities, or reducing general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount. The ultimate success of these plans is not guaranteed.



The Company's current cash and working capital, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is not expected to be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations over the next twelve months. As a result, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to meet its financial needs and continue as a going concern.

Financing Arrangement Summary



Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility



On June 5, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement between themselves, the lenders party thereto and Centre Lane Partners Master Credit Fund II, L.P., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (“Centre Lane Partners”), as amended (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement has been amended numerous times to change the terms, including the amounts outstanding, the interest rate, the maturity date and other payment terms.



The outstanding principal owed to Centre Lane Partners was $72.5 million and $70.2 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and matures on April 20, 2026. Of the amount outstanding at March 31, 2024, $879,000, $3.0 million, $879,000, $879,000 and $879,000 are due on March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024 December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, respectively. The balance of $66.0 million is due in 2025 or later.



The amount due under the Credit Agreement bears interest of 7.0% per annum plus the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). At March 31, 2024, the SOFR was 5.33%, thus the overall interest rate on this facility was 12.33% per annum at March 31, 2024.



Interest is paid in kind at 12.33% per annum on approximately $35.2 million of the amount owed under the Credit Agreement, and at 15% per annum on $30.3 million of the amount owed under the Credit Agreement. With respect to the remaining $7.0 million owed under the facility, interest is paid in kind at 4% per annum and in cash at the SOFR plus 3.0% (for a total interest rate of 8.33% per annum at March 31, 2024).



Effective July 1, 2024, the $35.2 million outstanding under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility will bear interest at 7.0% per annum, plus the SOFR plus 5.0%. 



For a full description of the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, see Note 10, "Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility," to the consolidated financial statements.



10% Convertible Promissory Note



During November 2018, the Company issued a 10% convertible promissory note (the "Convertible Note") in the amount of $80,000 to the Chairman of the Board, a related party. The Convertible Note is unsecured, matured five years from issuance and was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $0.40 per share. The outstanding principal and interest of the Convertible Note was due and payable in November 2023. At March 31, 2024, approximately $121,000 inclusive of principal and interest is due and payable, and the outstanding principal continues to accrue interest.



For a full description of the Convertible Note, see Note 11, "10% Convertible Promissory Note" to the consolidated financial statements.

Operating Activities



Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from customers from revenue. Our primary uses of our operating cash, are for cost of revenue expenses, personnel-related expenditures and other general administrative expenses.



For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was $920,000. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during the period were our net loss of $4.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $481,000 for amortization of intangible assets, $615,000 of amortization of debt discount, $2.2 million in interest paid in kind on the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, $65,000 for stock option compensation expense, and a $2.3 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $2.2 million decrease in accounts receivables partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $123,000, a $138,000 increase in interest payable on the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, and a $1.7 million increase in deferred revenue.



For the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $1.0 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during the period were our net loss of $3.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $386,000 for amortization of intangible assets, $305,000 of amortization of debt discount, $789,000 in interest paid in kind on the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, $25,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $188,000 for the recoveries of expected credit losses, and a $1.4 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $2.5 million increase in accounts receivable and a $142,000 increase in prepaid and other current assets, offset by a $1.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense, a $72,000 decrease in interest payable on the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, and a $237,000 decrease in deferred revenue.

Investing Activities



Cash used in investing activities of $2,000 and $5,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was due entirely to the purchase of property and equipment.

Financing Activities



During the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 the Company raised $0 and $1.5 million, respectively, of debt financing from the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility, which was used primarily to fund our working capital.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments



The Company leases its corporate offices in Boca Raton, Florida under a long-term non-cancellable lease agreement which was signed on June 14, 2022, with a lease term of five years beginning upon completion of improvements to the office space by the landlord, which was completed on September 12, 2022. The annual base rent is $100,000, with a provision for a 3% increase on each anniversary of the rent commencement date. The Company has the option to renew the lease for one additional five-year term. See Note 12, Leases for details regarding the Company’s lease.

There were no other material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments from those disclosed above and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to shareholders.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 

42





presented. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.



Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, allowance for current expected credit losses, the determination of the relative selling prices of our services, percentage of completion for revenue recognition, estimates of amortization period for intangible assets, estimates of depreciation period for property and equipment, discount rates used in the valuation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, litigation reserves, the valuation of equity-based transactions, valuation of the Center Lane Senior Secured Facility carrying value regarding debt modification or extinguishment, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.



Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or otherwise complex. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recent accounting pronouncements are detailed in the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Smaller Reporting Company Status

We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even though we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.



As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include information otherwise required by this Item 3 to Form 10-Q.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (its principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (its principal financial officer), have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of and for the period ended March 31, 2024, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting described below, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.



Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, senior management and other personnel, to provide 

43





reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.



Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). 



As the Company integrates the operations acquired through the Big Village Acquisition, there is a risk of identifying deficiencies in our overall internal controls. Our focus is on implementing and maintaining effective financial management systems and internal controls, on an ongoing process. However, given that all such controls are not yet fully operational, management has concluded that a material weakness exists in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, rendering them ineffective at December 31, 2023.



As set forth below, management will take steps to remediate the material weaknesses identified below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below, we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.



Outlined below are the material weaknesses identified by management, along with the remedial actions planned.



Material Weaknesses



A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2023, management identified certain material weaknesses.



As the Company continues to integrate the operations assumed as part of the Big Village Acquisition, we have identified deficiencies in our overall internal controls, specifically as identified below:



•Inadequate controls related to revenue recognition, cost of revenue, and the accounts payable and accrual process

leading to potential omission or misstatement of material transactions impacting financial statements; and



•Ineffectiveness of the Company’s information technology systems and controls concerning financial information.



To address these weaknesses, the Company has initiated a remediation plan comprising the following measures: 



•Updating the information technology general controls ("ITGC") risk assessment to incorporate operations from the Big Village Acquisition;



•Examination of information technology systems to ascertain necessary updates to support the financial reporting process;



•Collaboration with a third-party company to ensure SOX compliance, establish and document controls related to revenue recognition, accounts payable, and other processes to enhance internal controls over financial reporting; and



•Expansion of our finance department through the hiring of certified public accountants with prior auditing experience, knowledge of SEC filings and technical issues. In the year ended December 31, 2023, two additional certified public accountants were onboarded, tasked with month end close oversights and SEC reporting. We believe this will strengthen our finance department as we work towards strong internal controls and provide 

44





guidance beyond the finance functions for those we rely on to provide information to support our financial reporting process.



We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.



45





Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



Other than the matters set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures



In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
