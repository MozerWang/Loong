CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding:

 

          ●    we have generated no significant revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain;

 

          ●    if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our

                product development and you will likely lose your entire

                investment;

 

          ●    our financial situation creates doubt whether we will continue as a going concern;

 

          ●    we may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all;

 

          ●    even if we can raise additional funding, we may be required to do so on terms that are dilutive to you.;

 

          ●    the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals

                for the commercialization of our future product candidates, if

                any;

 

          ●    we may encounter substantial delays in completing our clinical studies which in turn will require additional costs, or

                we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory

                authorities;

 

          ●    if our future pre-clinical development and future clinical Phase I/II studies are unsuccessful, we may be unable to

                obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize, our product candidates on a timely basis or at

                all;

 

          ●    even if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully

                commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from their sales, if any, may be

                limited;

 

          ●    adverse events involving our products may lead the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency to delay or deny

                clearance for our products or result in product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial

                results;

 

          ●    certain technologies are subject to licenses from LLU and Stanford (as defined below), each of which are revocable in

                certain circumstances, including in the event we do not achieve certain payments and milestone deadlines. Without

                these licenses, we may not be able to continue to develop our product

                candidates;

 

          ●    if we were to lose our CLIA certification or state laboratory licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension

                or limitation, we would no longer be able to offer our assays (including our AditxtScore™ platform), which would limit

                our revenues and harm our business. If we were to lose, or fail to obtain, a license in any other state where we are

                required to hold a license, we would not be able to test specimens from those

                states;

 

          ●    our results of operations will be affected by the level of royalty and milestone payments that we are required to pay

                to third

                parties;

 

          ●    we face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before

                or more successfully than we

                do;

 

          ●    our technologies and products under development, and our business, may fail if we are not able to successfully

                commercialize them and ultimately generate significant revenues as a

                result;

 

ii

 

 

          ●    customers may not adopt our products quickly, or at all;

 

          ●    the failure to obtain or maintain patents, licensing agreements and other intellectual property could materially impact

                our ability to compete

                effectively;

 

          ●    some of our intellectual property may be subject to “march-in” rights by the U.S. federal government;

 

          ●    we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future;

 

          ●    we have issued a significant number of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, options and warrants and may

                continue to do so in the future. The vesting and, if applicable, exercise of these securities and the sale of the

                shares of common stock issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in

                downward pressure on the price of our common

                stock;

 

          ●    future sales or issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, including, potentially as a result of future

                acquisitions or strategic transactions, including the transaction with Cellvera Global, could result in significant

                dilution;

 

          ●    while we have entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Cellvera Global, we cannot assure you that the transaction

                contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement will be consummated or, that if such transaction is consummated, that it

                will be accretive to stockholder

                value;

 

          ●    we may engage in future acquisitions or strategic transactions, including the transaction with Cellvera Global, which

                may require us to seek additional financing or financial commitments, increase our expenses and/or present significant

                distractions to our

                management;

 

          ●    we received the determination from Nasdaq that we regained compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements,

                however, we remain subject to a panel monitor of our ongoing compliance until December 29, 2024 and if we fail to

                comply with such requirements during the panel monitor, it could result in the delisting of our securities by Nasdaq;

                and

 

          ●    exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.

 

All of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if such results, changes, or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us following this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company surveys, market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications, articles, and surveys. Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys, and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. While we believe that such studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources.

On December 6, 2021, the Company completed a public offering for net proceeds of $16.0 million (the “December 2021 Offering”). As part of the December 2021 Offering, we issued 4,123 units consisting of shares of the Company’s common stock and warrant to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and 4,164 prefunded warrants. The warrant issued as part of the units had an exercise price of $2,300.00 and the prefunded warrants had an exercise price of $0.04.

The April Pre-Funded Warrants (and shares of common stock underlying the April Pre-Funded Warrants) were offered by the Company pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-257645), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13, 2021. Concurrently with the sale of the April Pre-Funded Warrants, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in a concurrent private placement, for each April Pre-Funded Warrant purchased by the investor, such investor received from the Company an unregistered warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase two shares of Common Stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $34.40 per share, and are exercisable for a three year period. In addition, the Company issued a warrant to the placement agent to purchase up to 2,378 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $61.00 per share.

Risks and Uncertainties

 

The Company has a limited operating history and is in the very early stages of generating revenue from intended operations. The Company’s business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide along with local, state, and federal governmental policy decisions. A host of factors beyond the Company’s control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse conditions may include: changes in the biotechnology regulatory environment, technological advances that render our technologies obsolete, availability of resources for clinical trials, acceptance of technologies into the medical community, and competition from larger, more well-funded companies. These adverse conditions could affect the Company’s financial condition and the results of its operations.

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN ANALYSIS

 

Management Plans

 

The Company was incorporated on September 28, 2017 and has not generated significant revenues to date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $14,868,694 and negative cash flow from operating activities of $5,960,931. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s cash balance was $88,671.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $1.8 million of availability to sell under its shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Upon the filing of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K on April 16, 2024, the Company’s aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates was below $3.0 million. As a result, the maximum amount that the Company can sell under its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 during any 12 month period is equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates of the Company.

 

On November 21, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Public Float Rule. On December 29, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule but will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. 

 

If we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants would likely be significantly adversely affected. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.

 

The Company continues to actively pursue numerous capital raising transactions with the objective of obtaining sufficient bridge funding to meet the Company’s existing capital needs as well as more substantial capital raises to meet the Company’s longer-term needs.

 

In addition, factors such as stock price, volatility, trading volume, market conditions, demand and regulatory requirements may adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise capital in an efficient manner. Because of these factors, the Company believes that this creates substantial doubt with the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

In addition to the shelf registration, the Company has the ability to raise capital from equity or debt through private placements or public offerings pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. We may also secure loans from related parties.

 

The financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed herein. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to complete clinical studies and implement the business plan, generate sufficient revenues and to control operating expenses. In addition, the Company is consistently focused on raising capital, strategic acquisitions and alliances, and other initiatives to strengthen the Company.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes related thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aditxt, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and, one majority owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates underlying the financial statements include the collectability of notes receivable, the reserve on insurance billing, value of preferred shares issued, our investments in preferred shares, estimation of discounts on non-interest bearing borrowing, and the fair value of stock options and warrants.

 

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

 

     Level 1    - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the

                   measurement

                   date.

 

     Level 2    - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for

                   identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that

                   are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market

                   data.

 

     Level 3    - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market

                   participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available

                   information.

 

The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820.

 

Due to the short-term nature of all financial assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet dates. (See Note 9)

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

 

The Company maintains its cash accounts at financial institutions which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At times, the Company may have deposits in excess of federally insured limits.

 

Substantially all the Company’s accounts receivable are with companies in the healthcare industry, individuals, and the U.S. government. However, concentration of credit risk is mitigated due to the Company’s number of customers. In addition, for receivables due from U.S. government agencies, the Company does not believe the receivables represent a credit risk as these are related to healthcare programs funded by the U.S. government and payment is primarily dependent upon submitting the appropriate documentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, liquid investments.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory consists of laboratory materials and supplies used in laboratory analysis. We capitalize inventory when purchased. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. We periodically perform obsolescence assessments and write off any inventory that is no longer usable.

 

Fixed Assets

 

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures for furniture, office equipment, laboratory equipment, and other assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. The costs of fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease life of the related assets.

 

Useful lives assigned to fixed assets are as follows:

 

Computers                                                           Three years to five years

Lab Equipment                                                       Seven to ten years

Office Furniture                                                    Five to ten years

Other fixed assets                                                  Five to ten years

Leasehold Improvements                                              Shorter of estimated useful life or remaining lease term

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. For intangible assets that have finite lives, the assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, the assets are tested periodically for impairment.

As of December 31, 2023                                                                                                     22,711,221

As of March 31, 2024                                                                                                    $   22,711,221 

 

This investment is included in its own line item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

 

Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net.

 

10

 

 

We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and business forecasts and lower valuations in recently completed or anticipated financings, and recognize a charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. For equity method investments, we record impairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-than-temporary.

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company determines if receivables are past due based on days outstanding, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible by management. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of zero and zero, respectively. Accounts receivable is made up of billed and unbilled of $273,802 and $153,242 as of March 31, 2024 and $236,605 and $171,721 as of December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Income Taxes

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

 

Offering Costs

 

Offering costs incurred in connection with equity are recorded as a reduction of equity and offering costs incurred in connection with debt are recorded as a reduction of debt as a debt discount. Equity instruments issued as offering costs have zero net effect on the Company’s equity.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

In accordance with ASC 606 (Revenue From Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps:

 

     1)   Identify the contract with a customer

 

     2)   Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 

     3)   Determine the transaction price

 

     4)   Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract

 

     5)   Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

 

Revenues reported from services relating to the AditxtScore™ are recognized when the AditxtScoreTM report is delivered to the customer. The services performed include the analysis of specimens received in the Company’s CLIA laboratory and the generation of results which are then delivered upon completion.

 

11

 

 

The Company recognizes revenue in the following manner for the following types of customers:

 

Client Payers:

 

Client payers include physicians or other entities for which services are billed based on negotiated fee schedules. The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience and the period of time the receivable has been outstanding.

 

Cash Pay:

 

Customers are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. Collection of billings is subject to credit risk and the ability of the patients to pay.

 

Insurance:

 

Reimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on fee for service schedules. Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, collection experience, and the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements.

 

Leases

 

Under Topic 842 (Leases), operating lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. The Company has operating leases consisting of office space, laboratory space, and lab equipment.

 

Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the lease liabilities and right of use (“ROU”) assets.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense recognized includes the compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted to employees, officers, and directors based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718. ASC 718 is also applied to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled during the periods reported. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite vesting period and over the nonemployee’s period of providing goods or services.

 

Patents

 

The Company incurs fees from patent licenses, which are reflected in research and development expenses, and are expensed as incurred. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred patent licensing fees of $61,666 and $60,000, respectively.

 

Research and Development

 

We incur research and development costs during the process of researching and developing our technologies and future offerings. We expense these costs as incurred unless such costs qualify for capitalization under applicable guidance. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred research and development costs of $8,145,266 and $1,387,541, respectively.

 

Non-controlling Interest in Subsidiary

 

Non-controlling interests represent the Company’s subsidiary’s cumulative results of operations and changes in deficit attributable to non-controlling shareholders. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $138,967 and $0 in net loss attributable to non-controlling interest in Pearsanta. The Company owns approximately 90.2% of Pearsanta, Inc., as of March 31, 2024.

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share

 

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for each period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable of common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the common stock equivalents. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. As of March 31, 2024, 45,572 stock options, 0 unvested restricted stock units, 5,097,080 warrants, 22,280 shares of preferred series A-1 stock, 6,000 shares of preferred series B-1, and 2,625 shares of preferred series B-2 stock were excluded from dilutive earnings per share as their effects were anti-dilutive.

As the January 2024 Secured Notes and September 2024 Secured Notes did not contain a stated interest rate, the Company calculated an imputed interest rate of 26.7% based on the Company’s weighted average cost of capital for the period in which the January 2024 Secured Notes and September 2024 Secured Notes were outstanding. This amounted to approximately $1.8 million which was recorded as a discount to be amortized over the life of the January 2024 Secured Notes and September 2024 Secured Notes.

 

Secured Notes Amendments and Assignment

 

On January 2, 2024, the Company and certain holders of the secured notes (the “Holders”) entered into amendments to the January 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 1 to January 2024 Secured Notes”), pursuant to which the maturity date of the January 2024 Notes was extended to January 5, 2024.

 

On January 5, 2024, the Company and the Holders entered into amendments to the January 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 2 to January 2024 Secured Notes”) and amendments to the September 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 1 to September 2024 Secured Notes”), pursuant to which the Company and the Holders agreed that in consideration of a principal payment in the aggregate amount of $1 million on the January 2024 Secured Notes and in increase in the aggregate principal balance of $250,000 on the September 2024 Secured Notes, that the maturity date of the January 2024 Secured Notes would be further extended to January 31, 2024.

 

On January 31, 2024, the Company and the Holders entered into amendments to the January 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 3 to January 2024 Secured Notes”), pursuant to which the maturity date of the January 2024 Notes was extended to February 29, 2024. In addition, on January 31, 2024, the Company and the Holders entered into amendments to the September 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 2 to September 2024 Secured Notes”), pursuant to which the Company and the Holders agreed that in consideration of a principal payment in the aggregate amount of $1.25 million on the January 2024 Secured Notes and in increase in the aggregate principal balance of $300,000 on the September 2024 Secured Notes.

Pursuant to Amendment No. 3 to the January 2024 Secured Notes, the Company was required to make the Additional Consideration payment no later than February 9, 2024. As a result of the Company’s failure to make the Additional Consideration payment by February 9, 2023, the January 2024 Secured Notes and the September 2024 Secured Notes were in default and the entire principal balance of the January 2024 Secured Notes and the September 2024 Secured Notes, without demand or notice, were due and payable.

 

As a result of the defaults on the January 2024 Secured Notes and the September 2024 Secured Notes, the Company was in default on the Business Loan and Security Agreement dated January 24, 2024 (the January Business Loan”), which had a current balance of approximately $5.2 million, and the Business Loan and Security Agreement dated November 7, 2023 (the “November Business Loan”) which had a current balance of approximately $2.7 million.

 

On February 26, 2024, the Company and the Holders entered into an Assignment Agreement (the “February Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company assigned all remaining amounts due under the January 2024 Secured Notes, the September 2024 Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) back to the Holders. The Company recognized a $208,670 loss on the transfer of these notes. In connection with the February Assignment Agreement, the Company and the Holders entered into a payoff letter (the “Payoff Letter”) and amendments to the January 2024 Secured Notes (“Amendment No. 4 to January 2024 Secured Notes”), pursuant to which the maturity date of the January 2024 Secured Notes was extended to March 31, 2024 and the outstanding balance under the Notes, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the February Assignment Agreement as applied pursuant to the Payoff Letter, was adjusted to $250,000. On April 15, 2024, the Company repaid the $250,000.

 

NOTE 8 – LEASES

 

Our lease agreements generally do not provide an implicit borrowing rate; therefore, an internal incremental borrowing rate is determined based on information available at lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments. We used the incremental borrowing rate on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for all leases that commenced prior to that date. In determining this rate, which is used to determine the present value of future lease payments, we estimate the rate of interest we would pay on a collateralized basis, with similar payment terms as the lease and in a similar economic environment.

 

Our corporate headquarters is located in Richmond, Virginia, where we lease approximately 25,000 square feet. The lease expires in August 31, 2026, subject to extension. As of March 31, 2024 the Company is 4.75 months in arrears on this lease.

 

On March 6, 2024, the Company received correspondence from 532 Realty Associates, LLC (the “Landlord”) that the Company is in default under that certain Agreement of Lease dated November 3, 2021 by and between the Landlord and the Company (the “New York Lease”) for failure to pay Basic Rent and Additional Rent (as each term is defined in the New York Lease) in the aggregate amount of $40,707 (the “Past Due Rent”).

 

We also lease approximately 5,810 square feet of laboratory and office space in Mountain View, California. The lease expires in August 31, 2024, subject to extension. As of March 31, 2024 the Company is 4 months in arrears on this lease.

 

Additionally, we lease approximately 3,150 square feet of office space in Melville, New York. The lease expires in December 31, 2025, subject to extension. As of March 31, 2024 the Company is 4 months in arrears on this lease.

 

The overdue amounts represent a payable of $413,300 which are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 9 – COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES

 

License Agreement with Loma Linda University

 

On March 15, 2018, as amended on July 1, 2020, we entered into a LLU License Agreement directly with Loma Linda University.

 

Pursuant to the LLU License Agreement, we obtained the exclusive royalty-bearing worldwide license in and to all intellectual property, including patents, technical information, trade secrets, proprietary rights, technology, know-how, data, formulas, drawings, and specifications, owned or controlled by LLU and/or any of its affiliates (the “LLU Patent and Technology Rights”) and related to therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (the ADI™ technology). In consideration for the LLU License Agreement, we issued 13 shares of common stock to LLU.

 

20

 

 

Pursuant to the LLU License Agreement, we are required to pay an annual license fee to LLU. Also, we paid LLU $455,000 in July 2020 for outstanding milestone payments and license fees. We are also required to pay to LLU milestone payments in connection with certain development milestones. Specifically, we are required to make the following milestone payments to LLU: $175,000 on March 31, 2022; $100,000 on March 31, 2024; $500,000 on March 31, 2026; and $500,000 on March 31, 2027. In lieu of the $175,000 milestone payment due on March 31, 2023, the Company paid LLU an extension fee of $100,000. The Company did not make the March 31, 2024 payment; the Company intends to obtain an extension for this payment. Upon payment of this extension fee, an additional year will be added for the March 31, 2023 milestone. Additionally, as consideration for prior expenses incurred by LLU to prosecute, maintain and defend the LLU Patent and Technology Rights, we made the following payments to LLU: $70,000 at the end of December 2018, and a final payment of $60,000 at the end of March 2019. We are required to defend the LLU Patent and Technology Rights during the term of the LLU License Agreement. Additionally, we will owe royalty payments of (i) 1.5% of Net Product Sales (as such terms are defined under the LLU License Agreement) and Net Service Sales on any Licensed Products (defined as any finished pharmaceutical products which utilizes the LLU Patent and Technology Rights in its development, manufacture or supply), and (ii) 0.75% of Net Product Sales and Net Service Sales for Licensed Products and Licensed Services (as such terms are defined under the LLU License Agreement) not covered by a valid patent claim for technology rights and know-how for a three (3) year period beyond the expiration of all valid patent claims. We also are required to produce a written progress report to LLU, discussing our development and commercialization efforts, within 45 days following the end of each year. All intellectual property rights in and to LLU Patent and Technology Rights shall remain with LLU (other than improvements developed by or on our behalf).

 

The LLU License Agreement shall terminate on the last day that a patent granted to us by LLU is valid and enforceable or the day that the last patent application licensed to us is abandoned. The LLU License Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement or by us upon 90 days written notice to LLU. LLU may terminate the LLU License Agreement in the event of (i) non-payments or late payments of royalty, milestone and license maintenance fees not cured within 90 days after delivery of written notice by LLU, (ii) a breach of any non-payment provision (including the provision that requires us to meet certain deadlines for milestone events (each, a “Milestone Deadline”)) not cured within 90 days after delivery of written notice by LLU and (iii) LLU delivers notice to us of three or more actual breaches of the LLU License Agreement by us in any 12-month period. Additional Milestone Deadlines include: (i) the requirement to have regulatory approval of an IND application to initiate first-in-human clinical trials on or before March 31, 2023, which will be extended to March 31, 2024 with a payment of a $100,000 extension fee, (ii) the completion of first-in-human (phase I/II) clinical trials by March 31, 2024, (iii) the completion of Phase III clinical trials by March 31, 2026 and (iv) biologic licensing approval by the FDA by March 31, 2027. The Company has not initiated clinical trials to date and the Company intends to obtain an extension to commence human trials by March 31, 2025.

 

License Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University

 

On February 3, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “February 2020 License Agreement”) with Stanford regarding a patent concerning a method for detection and measurement of specific cellular responses. Pursuant to the February 2020 License Agreement, we received an exclusive worldwide license to Stanford’s patent regarding use, import, offer, and sale of Licensed Products (as defined in the agreement). The license to the patented technology is exclusive, including the right to sublicense, beginning on the effective date of the agreement, and ending when the patent expires. Under the exclusivity agreement, we acknowledged that Stanford had already granted a non-exclusive license in the Nonexclusive Field of Use, under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory (as those terms are defined in the February 2020 License Agreement”). However, Stanford agreed to not grant further licenses under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory. On December 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the February 2020 License Agreement which extended our exclusive right to license the technology deployed in AditxtScoreTM and securing worldwide exclusivity in all fields of use of the licensed technology.

 

21

 

 

We were obligated to pay and paid a fee of $25,000 to Stanford within 60 days of February 3, 2020. We also issued 10 shares   of the Company’s common stock to Stanford. An annual licensing maintenance fee is payable by us on the first anniversary of the February 2020 License Agreement in the amount of $40,000 for 2021 through 2024 and $60,000 starting in 2025 until the license expires upon the expiration of the patent. The Company is required to pay and has paid $25,000 for the issuances of certain patents. The Company will pay milestone fees of $50,000 on the first commercial sales of a licensed product and $25,000 at the beginning of any clinical study for regulatory clearance of an in vitro diagnostic product developed and a potential licensed product. The Company paid a milestone fee for a clinical study for regulatory clearance of an in vitro diagnostic product developed and a potential licensed product of $25,000 in March of 2022. We are also required to: (i) provide a listing of the management team or a schedule for the recruitment of key management positions by March 31, 2020 (which has been completed), (ii) provide a business plan covering projected product development, markets and sales forecasts, manufacturing and operations, and financial forecasts until at least $10,000,000 in revenue by June 30, 2020 (which has been completed), (iii) conduct validation studies by September 30, 2020 (which has been completed), (iv) hold a pre-submission meeting with the FDA by September 30, 2020 (which has been completed), (iv) submit a 510(k) application to the FDA, Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”), or a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”) by March 31, 2021 (which has been completed), (vi) develop a prototype assay for human profiling by December 31, 2021 (which has been completed), (vii) execute at least one partnership for use of the technology for transplant, autoimmunity, or infectious disease purposes by March 31, 2022 (which has been completed) and (viii) provided further development and commercialization milestones for specific fields of use in writing prior to December 31, 2022.

 

In addition to the annual license maintenance fees outlined above, we will pay Stanford royalties on Net Sales (as such term is defined in the February 2020 License Agreement) during the of the term of the agreement as follows: 4% when Net Sales are below or equal to $5 million annually or 6% when Net Sales are above $5 million annually. The February 2020 License Agreement may be terminated upon our election on at least 30 days advance notice to Stanford, or by Stanford if we: (i) are delinquent on any report or payment; (ii) are not diligently developing and commercializing Licensed Product; (iii) miss certain performance milestones; (iv) are in breach of any provision of the February 2020 License Agreement; or (v) provide any false report to Stanford. Should any events in the preceding sentence occur, we have a thirty (30) day cure period to remedy such violation.

On July 11, 2023, the Company filed a certificate of designation (the “Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of Delaware, effective as of the time of filing, designating the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the share of Preferred Stock. The Certificate of Designation provides that the share of Preferred Stock will have 250,000,000 votes and will vote together with the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as a single class exclusively with respect to any proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The Preferred Stock will be voted, without action by the holder, on any such proposal in the same proportion as shares of common stock are voted. The Preferred Stock otherwise has no voting rights except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

The Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company. The Preferred Stock has no rights with respect to any distribution of assets of the Company, including upon a liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. The holder of the Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive dividends of any kind.

 

The outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at any time (i) if such redemption is ordered by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion or (ii) automatically upon the effectiveness of the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation implementing a reverse stock split. Upon such redemption, the holder of the Preferred Stock will receive consideration of $1,000 in cash. As of December 31, 2023, the share has been redeemed and the consideration has been paid.

 

On July 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Subscription and Investment Representation Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Amro Albanna, its Chief Executive Officer, who is an accredited investor (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell one (1) share of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), to the Purchaser for $1,000 in cash. The sale closed on July 11, 2023. The Subscription Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and certain indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. See Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation incorporated by reference to this document. On August 17, 2023, the share was redeemed.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

In October 2017, our Board of Directors adopted the Aditx Therapeutics, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of equity awards to directors, employees, and consultants. The Company is authorized to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to awards granted under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan is administered by our Board of Directors, and expires ten years after adoption, unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. All shares of our common stock pursuant to awards under the 2017 Plan have been awarded.

 

On February 24, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted the Aditx Therapeutics, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards (collectively, the “Awards”). Eligible recipients of Awards include employees, directors or independent contractors of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.

The 2021 Plan was submitted and approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, held on May 19, 2021.

Warrants

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the fair value of each warrant granted was estimated using the assumption and/or factors in the Black-Scholes Model as follows:

 

Exercise price                                                                                                          $        5.23 

Expected dividend yield                                                                                                             0%

Risk free interest rate                                                                                                          3.97%

Expected life in years                                                                                                            5.0 

Expected volatility                                                                                                               219%

 

The risk-free interest rate assumption for warrants granted is based upon observed interest rates on the United States Government Bond Equivalent Yield appropriate for the expected term of warrants.

 

The Company determined the expected volatility assumption for warrants granted using the historical volatility of comparable public companies’ common stock. The Company will continue to monitor peer companies and other relevant factors used to measure expected volatility for future warrant grants, until such time that the Company’s common stock has enough market history to use historical volatility.

 

The dividend yield assumption for warrants granted is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The Company has never declared nor paid any cash dividends on its common stock, and the Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

 

The Company recognizes warrant forfeitures as they occur, as there is insufficient historical data to accurately determine future forfeitures rates.

NOTE 11 – INCOME TAXES

 

The Company has incurred losses since inception. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company did not provide any provision for income taxes as the Company incurred losses during such period. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company has considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets using a “more likely than not” standard. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Based on the Company’s review of this evidence, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2023, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

Appili Arrangement Agreement

 

On April 1, 2024 (the “Execution Date”), the Company, entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”), subject to various closing conditions, with Adivir, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Adivir” or the “Buyer”), and Appili Therapeutics, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Appili”), pursuant to which, Adivir will acquire all of the issued and outstanding Class A common shares of Appili (the “Appili Shares”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. The acquisition of the Appili Shares (the “Arrangement”) will be completed by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporation Act.

 

At the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”), each Appili Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appili Shares held by a registered holder of Appili Shares who has validly exercised such holder’s dissent rights) will be deemed to be assigned and transferred by the holder thereof to the Buyer in exchange for (i) $0.0467 in cash consideration per share for an aggregate cash payment of $5,668,222 (the “Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 0.002745004 of a share of common stock of Aditxt or an aggregate of 332,876 shares (the “Consideration Shares” and together with the Cash Consideration, the “Transaction Consideration”). In connection with the transaction, each outstanding option and warrant of Appili will be cashed-out based on the implied in-the-money value of the Transaction Consideration, which is expected to result in an additional aggregate cash payment of approximately $341,000 (based on the number of issued and outstanding options and warrants and exchange rates as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement). 

 

Promissory Note

 

On April 10, 2024, Sixth Borough Capital Fund, LP (“Sixth Borough) loaned $230,000 to the Company. The loan was evidenced by an unsecured promissory note (the “April Sixth Borough Note”).

On May 9, 2024, at which point the balance of the loan was $35,256, Sixth Borough loaned an additional $20,000 to the Company bringing the balance of the loan to $55,256.03. Additionally, the maturity date of the April Sixth Borough Note was extended to June 9, 2024.

 

EvoFem Reinstatement and Fourth Amendment to the Merger Agreement

 

On April 26, 2024, the Company received notice from Evofem (the “Termination Notice”) that Evofem was exercising its right to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the Company’s failure to provide the Initial Parent Equity Investment (as defined in the Merger Agreement, as amended).

 

On May 2, 2024, the Company, Adifem, Inc. f/k/a Adicure, Inc. and Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (“Evofem”) entered into the Reinstatement and Fourth Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”) in order to waive and amend, among other things, the several provisions listed below.

           Evofem’s Series F-1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series F-1 Preferred Stock”), equal to forty percent

           (40%) of the gross proceeds of such Parent Subsequent Capital Raise divided by 1,000, up to a maximum aggregate amount of

           $2,500,000 or 2,500 shares of Series F-1 Preferred Stock. A maximum of$1,500,000 shall be raised prior to June 17, 2024 and

           $1,000,000 prior to July 1, 2024 (the “Parent Capital

           Raise”).

           and

           Amount has not been paid to the Company by July 1, 2024, or (d) Aditxt does not pay any portion of the Parent Equity

           Investment within five calendar days after each closing of a Parent Subsequent Capital

           Raise.

 

Equity Line of Credit

 

On May 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “ELOC Purchase Agreement”) with an equity line investor (the “ELOC Investor”), pursuant to which the ELOC Investor has agreed to purchase from the Company, at the Company’s direction from time to time, in its sole discretion, from and after the date effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined below) and until the termination of the ELOC Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, shares of the Company’s common stock having a total maximum aggregate purchase price of $150,000,000 (the “ELOC Purchase Shares”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the ELOC Purchase Agreement.

 

In connection with the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Investor (the “ELOC Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares of common stock issued to the ELOC Investor pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement (the “Registration Statement”) by the later of (i) the 30th calendar day following the closing date, and (ii) the second business day following Stockholder Approval (defined below).

 

The Company may, from time to time and at its sole discretion, direct the ELOC Investor to purchase shares of its common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the ELOC Purchase Agreement at a purchase price per share based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the time of sale as computed under the ELOC Purchase Agreement. There is no upper limit on the price per share that the ELOC Investor could be obligated to pay for common stock under the ELOC Purchase Agreement. The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of its common stock to the ELOC Investor, and the ELOC Investor has no right to require us to sell any shares to it under the ELOC Purchase Agreement. Actual sales of shares of common stock to the ELOC Investor under the ELOC Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of its common stock and determinations by the Company as to available and appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The ELOC Investor may not assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the ELOC Purchase Agreement.

Under the applicable Nasdaq rules, in no event may the Company issue to the ELOC Investor under the ELOC Purchase Agreement more than 332,876 shares of common stock, which number of shares is equal to 19.99% of the shares of the common stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the ELOC Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of common stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules (“Stockholder Approval”), or (ii) the average price per share paid by the Investor for all of the shares of common stock that the Company directs the ELOC Investor to purchase from the Company pursuant to the ELOC Purchase Agreement, if any, equals or exceeds the official closing sale price on the Nasdaq Capital Market immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable purchase notice to the Investor and (B) the average of the closing sale prices of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital market for the five business days immediately preceding the delivery of such purchase notice.

 

In all cases, the Company may not issue or sell any shares of common stock to the ELOC Investor under the ELOC Purchase Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of the Company’s common stock then beneficially owned by the ELOC Investor and its affiliates, would result in the ELOC Investor beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

 

The net proceeds under the ELOC Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its stock to the ELOC Investor. The Company expects that any proceeds received by it from such sales to the Investor will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

 

As consideration for the ELOC Investor’s commitment to purchase shares of common stock at the Company’s direction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company shall pay the Investor a commitment fee as outlined in the ELOC Purchase Agreement, which is payable on the later of (i) January 2, 2025 and (ii) the trading day following the date on which Stockholder Approval is obtained.

 

The ELOC Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the ELOC Investor, limitations and conditions regarding sales of ELOC Purchase Shares, indemnification rights and other obligations of the parties.

 

There are no restrictions on future financings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the ELOC Purchase Agreement other than a prohibition (with certain limited exceptions) on entering into a dilutive securities transaction during certain periods when the Company is selling common stock to the ELOC Investor under the Purchase Agreement. The ELOC Investor has agreed that it will not engage in or effect, directly or indirectly, for its own account or for the account of any of its affiliates, any short sales of the Company’s common stock or hedging transaction that establishes a net short position in the Company’s common stock during the term of the ELOC Purchase Agreement.

 

The Company has the right to terminate the ELOC Purchase Agreement at any time after the Commencement Date (as defined in the ELOC Purchase Agreement), at no cost or penalty, upon three trading days’ prior written notice to the Investor. The Company and the ELOC Investor may also agree to terminate the ELOC Purchase Agreement by mutual written consent, provided that no termination of the ELOC Purchase Agreement will be effective during the pendency of any purchase that has not then fully settled in accordance with the ELOC Purchase Agreement. Neither the Company nor the ELOC Investor may assign or transfer the Company’s respective rights and obligations under the ELOC Purchase Agreement.

 

May Private Placement

 

On May 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “May PIPE Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to such investors in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) (i) an aggregate of 4,186 shares of the Company’s Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C-1 Preferred Stock”), (ii) an aggregate of 4,186 shares of the Company’s Series D-1 Preferred Stock (the “Series D-1 Preferred Stock”), and (iii) warrants (the “May PIPE Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,613,092 shares of the Company’s common stock.

The May PIPE Warrants are exercisable commencing six months following the initial issuance date at an initial exercise price of $2.47 per share and expire five years from the date of issuance.

 

On May 2, 2024, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the investors (the “May PIPE Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “May PIPE Registration Statement”) covering the resale of the shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 (the “Common Stock”) issuable upon conversion of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Shares”) and upon exercise of the May PIPE Warrants (the “May PIPE Warrant Shares”) (i) on the later of (x) the 30th calendar day after the closing date, or (y) the 2nd business day following the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined in the May PIPE Purchase Agreement), with respect to the initial registration statement and (ii) on the date on which the Company is required to file any additional May PIPE Registration Statement pursuant to the terms of the May PIPE Registration Rights Agreement with respect to any additional Registration Statements that may be required to be filed by the Company (the “Filing Deadline”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is required to have the initial May PIPE Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC on the earlier of (x) the 60th calendar day after the Filing Deadline (or the 90th calendar day after the Filing Deadline if subject to a full review by the SEC), and (y) the 2nd business day after the date the Company is notified by the SEC that such May PIPE Registration Statement will not be reviewed. In the event that the Company fails to file the May PIPE Registration Statement by the Filing Deadline, have it declared effective by the Effectiveness Deadline, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use or the investor is not otherwise able to sell its May PIPE Warrant Shares pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall be required to pay the investor an amount equal to 2% of such investor’s Purchase Price (as defined in the May PIPE Purchase Agreement) on the date of such failure and on every thirty date anniversary until such failure is cured.

 

In connection with the Private Placement, the Sixth Borough Note (Note 7) was converted into Series C-1 Preferred Stock.

 

The Private Placement closed on May 6, 2024. The gross proceeds from the Private Placement were approximately $4.2 million, prior to deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use $1.0 million of the net proceeds to fund certain obligations under its merger agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. and the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

 

Dawson James Securities (“Dawson James”) served as the Company’s exclusive placement agent in connection with the Private Placement, pursuant to that certain engagement letter, dated as of May 2, 2024, between the Company and Dawson James (the “Engagement Letter”). Pursuant to the Engagement Letter, the Company paid Dawson James (i) a total cash fee equal to 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Private Placement. In addition, the Company agreed to pay Dawson James certain expenses and issued to Dawson James or its designees warrants (the “May PIPE Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase 5% of the number of securities sold in the Private Placement. The May PIPE Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $3.24375 per share commencing six months following issuance and have a term of exercise equal to five years from the date of issuance.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data” and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A.

 

Overview and Mission

 

We believe the world needs—and deserves—a new approach to innovating that harnesses the power of large groups of stakeholders who work together to ensure that the most promising innovations make it into the hands of people who need them most.

 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 28, 2017, and our headquarters are in Richmond, Virginia. The company was founded with a mission of bringing stakeholders together, to transform promising innovations into products and services that could address some of the most challenging needs. The socialization of innovation through engaging stakeholders in every aspect of it, is key to transforming more innovations, more rapidly, and more efficiently.

 

At inception, the first innovation we took on was an immune modulation technology titled ADI/Adimune with a focus on prolonging life and enhancing life quality of patients that have undergone organ transplants. Since then, we expanded our portfolio of innovations, and we continue to evaluate a variety of promising health innovations.

  

ADIMUNE, INC.

 

Formed in January 2023, Adimune™, Inc. (“Adimune”) is focused on leading our immune modulation therapeutic programs. Adimune’s proprietary immune modulation product candidate, ADI-100™, based on the Apoptotic DNA Immunotherapy™ platform technology, utilizes a novel approach that mimics the way our bodies naturally induce tolerance to our own tissues. It includes two DNA molecules designed to deliver signals to induce tolerance. ADI-100 has been successfully tested in several preclinical models (e.g., skin grafting, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis).

 

In May 2023, Adimune entered into a clinical trial agreement with Mayo Clinic to advance clinical studies targeting autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (“CNS”) with the initial focus on the rare, but debilitating, autoimmune disease Stiff Person Syndrome (“SPS”). According to the National Organization of Rare Diseases, the exact incidence and prevalence of SPS is unknown; however, one estimate places the incidence at approximately one in one million individuals in the general population.

 

Pending approval by the International Review Board, a human trial for SPS is expected get underway in the first half of 2024 with enrollment of up to 20 patients, some of whom may also have type 1 diabetes. ADI-100 will initially be tested for safety and efficacy. ADI-100 is designed to tolerize against an antigen known as glutamic acid decarboxylase (“GAD”), which is implicated in type-1 diabetes, psoriasis, stiff person syndrome, and in many autoimmune diseases of the CNS.

 

Background

 

The discovery of immunosuppressive (anti-rejection and monoclonal) drugs over 40 years ago has made possible life-saving organ transplantation procedures and blocking of unwanted immune responses in autoimmune diseases. However, immune suppression leads to significant undesirable side effects, such as increased susceptibility to life-threatening infections and cancers, because it indiscriminately and broadly suppresses immune function throughout the body. While the use of these drugs has been justifiable because they prevent or delay organ rejection, their use for treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies may not be acceptable because of the aforementioned side effects. Furthermore, often transplanted organs ultimately fail despite the use of immune suppression, and about 40% of transplanted organs survive no more than five years.

 

41

 

 

Through Aditxt, Adimune has the right of use to the exclusive worldwide license for commercializing ADI nucleic acid-based technology (which is currently at the pre-clinical stage) from Loma Linda University. ADI uses a novel approach that mimics the way the body naturally induces tolerance to our own tissues (“therapeutically induced immune tolerance”). While immune suppression requires continuous administration to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ, induction of tolerance has the potential to retrain the immune system to accept the organ for longer periods of time. ADI may allow patients to live with transplanted organs with significantly reduced immune suppression. ADI is a technology platform which we believe can be engineered to address a wide variety of indications. 

 

Advantages

 

ADI™ is a nucleic acid-based technology (e.g., DNA-based), which we believe selectively suppresses only those immune cells involved in attacking or rejecting self and transplanted tissues and organs. It does so by tapping into the body’s natural process of cell turnover (i.e., apoptosis) to retrain the immune system to stop unwanted attacks on self or transplanted tissues. Apoptosis is a natural process used by the body to clear dying cells and to allow recognition and tolerance to self-tissues. ADI triggers this process by enabling the cells of the immune system to recognize the targeted tissues as “self.” Conceptually, it is designed to retrain the immune system to accept the tissues, similar to how natural apoptosis reminds our immune system to be tolerant to our own “self” tissues.

 

While various groups have promoted tolerance through cell therapies and ex vivo manipulation of patient cells (i.e., takes place outside the body), to our knowledge, we will be unique in our approach of using in-body induction of apoptosis to promote tolerance to specific tissues. In addition, ADI treatment itself will not require additional hospitalization but only an injection of minute amounts of the therapeutic drug into the skin.  

        

Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated that ADI treatment significantly and substantially prolongs graft survival, in addition to successfully “reversing” other established immune-mediated inflammatory processes.

 

License Agreement with Loma Linda University (“LLU”) 

 

On March 15, 2018, we entered into a License Agreement with LLU, which was subsequently amended on July 1, 2020. Pursuant to the LLU License Agreement, we obtained the exclusive royalty-bearing worldwide license to all intellectual property, including patents, technical information, trade secrets, proprietary rights, technology, know-how, data, formulas, drawings, and specifications, owned or controlled by LLU and/or any of its affiliates (the “LLU Patent and Technology Rights”) and related to therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (the ADI™ technology). In consideration for the LLU License Agreement, we issued 25,000 shares of common stock to LLU.

 

PEARSANTA, INC.

 

Formed in January 2023, our subsidiary Pearsanta™, Inc. (“Pearsanta”) seeks to take personalized medicine to a whole new level by delivering “Health by the Numbers.” Since its founding, Pearsanta has been building the platform for enabling our vision of lab quality testing, anytime, anywhere. Our plan for Pearsanta’s platform is for it to be the transactional backbone for sample collection, sample processing (on- and off-site), and reporting. This will require the development and convergence of multiple components developed by Pearsanta, or through transactions with third parties, including collection devices, “lab-on-a-chip” technologies, Lab Developed Test (LDT) assays, a data-driven analysis engine, and telemedicine. According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future, the clinical and consumer diagnostic market is estimated to hit $429.3 billion by 2030.

 

42

 

 

We believe that timely and personalized testing enables far more informed treatment decisions. Pearsanta’s platform is being developed as a seamless digital healthcare solution. This platform will integrate at-location sample collection, Point-of-Care (“POC”) and LDT assays, and an analytical reporting engine, with telemedicine-enabled visits with licensed physicians to review test results and, if necessary, order a prescription. Pearsanta’s goal of extending its platform to enable consumers to monitor their health more proactively as the goal is to provide a more complete picture about someone’s dynamic health status, factoring in genetic makeup and their response to medication. The POC component of Pearsanta would enable diagnostic testing at-home, at work, in pharmacies, and more to generate results quickly so that an individual can access necessary treatment faster. With certain infections, prescribing the most effective treatment according to one’s numbers can prevent hospital emergency room admissions and potentially life-threatening consequences.

 

Examples of indication-focused tests for the Test2Treat platform will include the evaluation for advanced urinary tract infections (“UTIs”), COVID-19/flu/respiratory syncytial virus, sexually transmitted infections, gut health, pharmacogenomics (i.e., how your genes affect the way your body responds to certain therapeutics), and sepsis. We believe that these offerings are novel and needed as the current standard of care using broad spectrum antibiotic treatment can be ineffective and potentially life-threatening. For example, improperly prescribed antibiotics may approach 50% of outpatient cases. Further, according to an article published in Physician’s Weekly, only 1% of board-certified critical care medicine physicians are trained in infectious disease.

 

Licensed Technologies – AditxtScoreTM  

  

We intend to sublicense to Pearsanta an exclusive worldwide sub-license for commercializing the AditxtScore™ technology which provides a personalized comprehensive profile of the immune system. AditxtScore is intended to detect individual immune responses to viruses, bacteria, peptides, drugs, supplements, bone marrow and solid organ transplants, and cancer. It has broad applicability to many other agents of clinical interest impacting the immune system, including those not yet identified such as emerging infectious agents.

 

AditxtScore is being designed to enable individuals and their healthcare providers to understand, manage and monitor their immune profiles and to stay informed about attacks on or by their immune system. We believe AditxtScore can also assist the medical community and individuals by being able to anticipate the immune system’s potential response to viruses, bacteria, allergens, and foreign tissues such as transplanted organs. This technology may be able to serve as a warning signal, thereby allowing for more time to respond appropriately. Its advantages include the ability to provide simple, rapid, accurate, high throughput assays that can be multiplexed to determine the immune status with respect to several factors simultaneously, in approximately 3-16 hours. In addition, it can determine and differentiate between distinct types of cellular and humoral immune responses (e.g., T and B cells and other cell types). It also provides for simultaneous monitoring of cell activation and levels of cytokine release (i.e., cytokine storms).

  

We are actively involved in the regulatory approval process for AditxtScore assays for clinical use and securing manufacturing, marketing, and distribution partnerships for application in the various markets. To obtain regulatory approval to use AditxtScore as a clinical assay, we have conducted validation studies to evaluate its performance in detection of antibodies and plan to continue conducting additional validation studies for new applications in autoimmune diseases.

 

Advantages 

 

The sophistication of the AditxtScore technology includes the following:

 

          ●    greater sensitivity/specificity.

 

          ●    20-fold higher dynamic range, greatly reducing signal to noise compared to conventional assays.

 

          ●    ability to customize assays and multiplex a large number of analytes with speed and efficiency.

 

          ●    ability to test for cellular immune responses (i.e., T and B cells and cytokines).

 

          ●    proprietary reporting algorithm.

License Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”) 

 

On February 3, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “February 2020 License Agreement”) with Stanford with regard to a patent concerning a method for detection and measurement of specific cellular responses. Pursuant to the February 2020 License Agreement, we received an exclusive worldwide license to Stanford’s patent with regard to use, import, offer, and sale of Licensed Products (as defined in the agreement). The license to the patented technology is exclusive, including the right to sublicense, beginning on the effective date of the agreement, and ending when the patent expires. Under the exclusivity agreement, we acknowledged that Stanford had already granted a non-exclusive license in the Nonexclusive Field of Use, under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory (as those terms are defined in the “February 2020 License Agreement”). However, Stanford agreed not to grant further licenses under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory. On December 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the February 2020 License Agreement which extended our exclusive right to license the technology deployed in AditxtScoreTM and securing worldwide exclusivity in all fields of use of the licensed technology. 

 

ADIVIR, INC.

Our commitment to building our antiviral portfolio is strategic and timely. We believe that there has never has there been a more important time to address the growing global need to uncover new treatments or commercialize existing ones that treat life-threatening global viral infections.

 

Our Team

 

Aditxt has assembled an entrepreneurial team of experts from a variety of different business, engineering, and scientific fields, and commercial backgrounds, with collective experience that ranges from founding startup innovation companies, to developing and marketing biopharmaceutical and diagnostic products, to designing clinical trials, and management of private and public companies. We have deep experience in identifying and accessing promising health innovations and developing them into products and services with the ability to scale. We understand the capital markets, both public and private, as well as M&A and facilitating complex IPOs.

 

Going Concern

 

We were incorporated on September 28, 2017 and have not generated significant revenues to date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 we had a net loss of $14,868,694 and cash of $88,671 as of March 31, 2024.

 

We are currently over 90 days past due on a significant number of vendor obligations. The Company will require significant additional capital to operate in the normal course of business and fund clinical studies in the long-term. We believe our remaining funds on hand will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months and such creates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond one year.

 

Financial Results

 

We have a limited operating history. Therefore, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024, show a net loss of $14,868,694. We expect to incur additional net expenses over the next several years as we continue to maintain and expand our existing operations. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.

Results of Operations

 

Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

 

We generated revenue of $79,680 and $218,415 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $65,799 and $178,309, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of $11,549,527. This is due to general and administrative expenses of $3,363,748, which includes approximately $1,214,004 in payroll expenses, $1,145,679 in professional fees, and $20,477 in stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses were $8,145,266, which includes $201,579 in consulting expenses and $6,712,663 in stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses were $40,513.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of $5,822,001. This is due to general and administrative expenses of $4,368,843, which includes $274,315 in stock-based compensation, research and development of $1,387,541, which includes $62,633 in stock-based compensation, and sales and marketing expenses of negative $65,617, which includes $2,503 in stock-based compensation. The $1,387,541 in research and development is mainly comprised of $415,429 in consulting expenses, $673,377 in compensation and $62,633 in stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses were $65,617 which includes $2,503 in stock-based compensation.

 

The decrease in expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due to decreased research and development spend and the termination of a sales and marketing vendor.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We have incurred substantial operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $142,575,090. We had working capital of $(15,706,647) as of March 31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we purchased zero in fixed assets.

  

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

 

We have funded our operations from proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities. On July 2, 2020, we completed our IPO and raised approximately $9.5 million in net proceeds. At the time of the IPO, we believed that these funds would be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

 

On September 10, 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering. In connection therewith, we issued 1,200 units, or Follow-On Units, excluding the underwriters’ option to cover overallotments, at an offering price of $8,000.00 per Follow-On Unit, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $9.6 million.

 

On January 25, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional accredited investor (the “Investor”) for the sale of a $6,000,000 senior secured convertible note (the “Convertible Note”). The Convertible Note had a term of 24 months, was originally convertible at a price of $8,000.00 per share and was issued at an original issuance discount of $1,000,000. On August 30, 2021, the Company entered into a defeasance and waiver agreement with the Investor, pursuant to which the Noteholder has agreed in exchange for (a) a cash payment by the Company to the Investor of $1.2 million (the Cash Payment”), (b) a waiver, in part of the conversion price adjustment provision such that the January 2021 Note shall be convertible into 2,401 shares of common stock (without giving effect to the conversion notice received by the company form the Noteholder prior to the date hereof totaling (503 shares) (the “Shares”), and (c) a voluntary and permanent reduction by the Company of the exercise price of the warrant to purchase 400 shares of the common stock of the Company (the “January 2021 Warrant”) to $5,060 per share. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principle of the convertible note had been converted to 2,401 shares of common stock.

On August 30, 2021, the Company completed a registered direct offering and raised approximately $10.1 million in net proceeds.

 

On October 20, 2021, the Company completed a public offering for net proceeds of $3.8 million. As part of this offering, we issued 1,417 shares of the Company’s common stock

 

On December 6, 2021, the Company completed a public offering for net proceeds of $16.0 million. As part of this offering, we issued 4,123 units consisting of shares of the Company’s common stock and warrant to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and 4,164 pre-funded warrants. The warrant issued as part of the units had an exercise price of $2,300.00 and the prefunded warrants had an exercise price of $0.001.

 

On September 20, 2022, the Company completed a public offering for net proceeds of $18.1 million (the “September 2022 Offering”). As part of the September 2022 Offering, we issued 30,608 of shares of the Company’s common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 52,725 shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase 83,333 shares of the Company’s common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $240.00 and the pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of $0.004.

 

On April 20, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such investor pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 39,634 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) at a purchase price of $48.76 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Concurrently with the sale of the Pre-Funded Warrants, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in a concurrent private placement, for each Pre-Funded Warrant purchased by the investor, such investor received from the Company an unregistered warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase two shares of Common Stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $34.40 per share and are exercisable for a three-year period. In addition, the Company issued a warrant to the placement agent to purchase up to 2,378 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $61.00 per share. 

 

On August 31, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “August Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor for the issuance and sale in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of (i) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share, and (ii) warrants (the “Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share. The Private Placement closed on September 6, 2023. The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $9 million, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company utilized net proceeds received from the Private Placement for (i) payment of approximately $3.1 million in outstanding obligations, (ii) repayment of approximately $0.4 million of outstanding debt, and (iii) continuing operating expenses and working capital.

   

On December 29, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (“the “December Purchaser”) for the issuance and sale in a private placement (the “December Private Placement”) of (i) pre-funded warrants (the “December Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,237,114 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 at an exercise price of $0.001 per share, and (ii) warrants (the “December Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,474,228 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a purchase price of $4.85 per share.

 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company (“Certain Outstanding Warrants”) held by the Purchaser to $4.60 per share in consideration for the cash payment by the December Purchaser of $0.125 per share of Common Stock underlying the Certain Outstanding Warrants, effective immediately.

 

The December Private Placement closed on January 4, 2024. The net proceeds to the Company from the December Private Placement were approximately $5.5 million, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

 

In addition, the Company agreed to pay H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”) certain expenses and issued to Wainwright or its designees warrants (the “December Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 74,227 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $6.0625 per share. The December Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance and have a term of exercise equal to three years from the date of issuance.

We will need significant additional capital to continue to fund our operations and the clinical trials for our product candidates. We may seek to sell common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. In addition, we may seek to raise cash through collaborative agreements or from government grants. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities, or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights.

 

The source, timing, and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our clinical development program. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us to, among other things, delay, scale back or eliminate expenses including some or all our planned development, including our clinical trials. While we may need to raise funds in the future, we believe the current cash reserves should be sufficient to fund our operation for the foreseeable future. Because of these factors, we believe that this creates doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Contractual Obligations

 

The following table shows our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2024:

 

                                                                                             Payment Due by Year                       

                                                                           Total          2024           2025           2026

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates

 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that our critical accounting policies described under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plan of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” in our Prospectus, dated September 1, 2020, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b), are critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. The following involve the most judgment and complexity:

 

          ●    Research and development

 

          ●    Stock-based compensation expense

 

Accordingly, we believe the policies set forth above are critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. If actual results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

 

JOBS Act

 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

 

48

 

 

When favorable, we have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. 

 

We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO (December 31, 2025); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

Recent Developments

 

See Note 12 – Subsequent Event to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of material recent developments.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

 

We are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not materially changed since the Company determined that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and the following weaknesses still exist as of March 31,2024.

 

          ●    We did not maintain adequate controls over the documentation of accounting and financial reporting policies and

                procedures. Specifically, we did not maintain policies and procedures to ensure account reconciliations were

                adequately prepared and reviewed by

                management.

 

          ●    We did not retain individuals and/or entities with extensive knowledge to recognize and record technical and complex

                accounting

                issues.

 

          ●    We did not maintain the sufficient procedures for the identification and cutoff of accounts payable.

 

These material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements to the financial statements, which were corrected. There were no changes to previously released financial results. We are in the process of remediating these material weaknesses.

 

Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results.

 

Our financial situation creates doubt whether we will continue as a going concern.

 

The Company was incorporated on September 28, 2017 and through the date of this report has generated no significant revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a net loss of $32,390,447 and $27,649,876, respectively. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024, show a net loss of $14,868,694. Our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $88,671 as of March 31, 2024. There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If adequate working capital is not available, we may be forced to discontinue operations, which would cause investors to lose their entire investment.

 

If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development and you will likely lose your entire investment.

 

We will need to continue to seek capital from time to time to continue development of our lead drug candidate beyond our initial combined Phase I/IIa clinical trial and to acquire and develop other product candidates. Once approved for commercialization, we cannot provide any assurances that any revenues it may generate in the future will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations.

 

Our business or operations may change in a manner that would consume available funds more rapidly than anticipated and substantial additional funding may be required to maintain operations, fund expansion, develop new or enhance products, acquire complementary products, business or technologies, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and opportunities, such as a change in the regulatory environment or a change in preferred treatment modalities. In addition, we may need to accelerate the growth of our sales capabilities and distribution beyond what is currently envisioned, and this would require additional capital. However, we may not be able to secure funding when we need it or on favorable terms. We may not be able to raise sufficient funds to commercialize the product candidates we intend to develop.

 

If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we will have to delay, scale back or eliminate our research and development activities, clinical studies, or future operations. We may also be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators, which arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we otherwise would not consider relinquishing, including rights to future product candidates or certain major geographic markets. This could result in sharing revenues which we might otherwise retain for ourselves. Any of these actions may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 

The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including the progress, timing and scope of our product development programs; the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals; the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes and arrange for contract manufacturing; our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships; and our partners’ commitment of time and resources to the development and commercialization of our products.

Our obligations to certain of our creditors are secured by security interests in our assets, so if we default on those obligations, our creditors could foreclose on some or all of our assets.

 

Our obligations to certain of our creditors are secured by security interests in our assets. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $5.2 million was owed to such secured creditors. Under such agreements, we are required to pay $277,800 on a weekly basis to such creditors. If we default on our obligations under these agreements, our secured creditors could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations and would require us to reduce or cease operations and possibly seek Bankruptcy Protection.

 

In the event we pursue Bankruptcy Protection, we will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with such proceedings.

 

In the event we file for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code, our operations, our ability to develop and execute our business plan and our continuation as a going concern will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, including, among others: our ability to execute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; the additional, significant costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees; our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence, and our ability to comply with terms and conditions of that financing; our ability to continue our operations in the ordinary course; our ability to maintain our relationships with our consumers, business partners, counterparties, employees and other third parties; our ability to obtain, maintain or renew contracts that are critical to our operations on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions; our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees; the ability of third parties to use certain limited safe harbor provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code to terminate contracts without first seeking Bankruptcy Court approval; the ability of third parties to force us to into Chapter 7 proceedings rather than Chapter 11 proceedings and the actions and decisions of our stakeholders and other third parties who have interests in our bankruptcy proceedings that may be inconsistent with our operational and strategic plans. Any delays in our bankruptcy proceedings would increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process or result in prolonged operational disruption for us. Also, we would need the prior approval of the bankruptcy court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business during the course of any bankruptcy proceedings, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with any bankruptcy proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that could occur during any such proceedings. There can be no guarantees that if we seek Bankruptcy Protection we will emerge from Bankruptcy Protection as a going concern or that holders of our common stock will receive any recovery from any bankruptcy proceedings.

 

In the event we are unable to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or, if pursued, successfully emerge from such proceedings, it may be necessary to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for all or a part of our businesses.

 

In the event we are unable to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or, if pursued, successfully emerge from such proceedings, it may be necessary for us to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for all or a part of our businesses. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the United States Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our stakeholders than those we might obtain under Chapter 11 primarily because of the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern.

We received a written notice from Nasdaq that we have failed to comply with certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could result in our Common Stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.

 

On May 23, 2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq that, based upon the stockholders equity reported by the Company in its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023, and as of March 31, 2023, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires a company to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity, a market value of listed securities of at least $35 million, or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years (the “Continued Listing Requirements”). The May notification letter further provided that the Company has 45 calendar days, or until July 7, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance and if the plan is accepted by Nasdaq, an extension of up to 180 calendar days, or until November 19, 2023 to evidence compliance. On June 22, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has failed to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price rule in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Rule”) as the closing price of Company’s common stock has remained below $1.00 for over 30 consecutive trading days. On June 29, 2023, we submitted an appeal to Nasdaq, which stays the delisting and suspension of our securities pending the decision of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). At the hearing, which was held on August 31, 2023, which represented the tenth trading day that the closing of the Company’s common stock was above $1.00 per share. At the hearing, the Company also presented its plans to regain compliance with the Equity Rule to the Panel. In addition, on September 15, 2023, the Company received a written notice form Nasdaq that it no longer meets the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market and it no longer complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) (the “Public Float Rule”). The September notification letter stated that the Panel will consider this matter in their decision regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

 

On September 29, 2023, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq that the Panel had granted the Company an exception through December 26, 2023, to allow the Company to complete its compliance with the Equity Rule. The October notification letter also confirmed that the Company had demonstrated compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and granted the Company an exception through December 26, 2023 to allow the Company to demonstrate compliance with the Public Float Rule. On December 29, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule, but will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year.

 

If we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants would likely be significantly adversely affected.
