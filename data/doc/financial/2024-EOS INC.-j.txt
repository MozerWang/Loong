Organization

 

EOS Inc. was incorporated on April 3, 2015 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a distributor of various consumer products, such as skin care products, dietary supplements, and water purifying machines.

Emperor Star International Trade Co., Ltd., (“Emperor Star”), was incorporated on November 16, 2015 under the laws of Taiwan. Emperor Star is in the business of marketing and distribution of various products, including nutrition supplements, skin care products, and water purifiers.

 

On May 3, 2017, the Company entered into and closed a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Emperor Star and the shareholder of Emperor Star to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Emperor Star in consideration of $30,562 in cash. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, Emperor Star became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. Upon consummation of the transaction, the Company has assumed the business of Emperor Star and ceased to be a shell company.

 

On September 20, 2018, the Company set up another wholly-owned subsidiary, EOS International Inc. (“EOS(BVI)”), under the laws of British Virgin Islands. EOS(BVI) is in the business of marketing and distribution of various products, including nutrition supplements, skin care products, and water purifiers.

 

On March 1, 2019, EOS(BVI) set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Maosong Co., Ltd (“Maosong”), under the laws of People’s Republic of China. Maosong is in the business of marketing and distribution of various products, including nutrition supplements, skin care products, and water purifiers in China. As of the date of this report, Maosong has a registered capital of USD $100,000, but no capital has actually been paid into Maosong.

 

On June 2, 2020, EOS(BVI) 83.33% owner, and Shanghai Qifan Qiye Management Co., Ltd. (“Qifan”) 16.67% owner of Maosong resolute to change the registered capital of Maosong to RMB 1,200,000,000 (1.2 billion) and that EOS to contribute certain Intellectual Property as registered capital of Shanghai Maosong. Intellectual Property owned by EOS International Inc was valued at RMB 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) and Intellectual Property owned by Qifan was valued at RMB 200,000,000 (200 million). 

 

On July 13, 2021, EOS(BVI), MaoSong, and Qifan entered into a Shareholder Agreement where Qifan (i) delegate its 16.67% equity voting rights, powers, or benefits in Maosong to EOS(BVI); (ii) grant EOS(BVI) an irrevocable, unconditional, exclusive option to purchase Maosong’s equity interest; (iii) the right to receive any proceeds from the Maosong’s Equity Interest; (iv) pledge its existing or any prospective Maosong equity interest to EOS Int’l; as a result EOS(BVI) retains 100% control of MaoSong and the 16.67% noncontrolling interest are consolidated. 

On July 1, 2023, the Company assumes effective control of Emperor Star International Trade Co., Ltd (Emperor Star), a commerce and trade company, through execution of declaration of trust for Emperor Star’s 100% share capital. The primary reason the Company completed the equity transaction within owners is to invest resources, expand the operations and turn Emperor Star into a profitable business.

 

 

                                                                  F-6



  

 

Principles of Consolidation 

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the accounts of EOS Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries in Taiwan, British Virgin Islands, and People’s Republic of China, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Since the Company and Emperor Star are entities under common control prior to the acquisition of Emperor Star, the transaction is accounted for as a restructuring transaction. All assets and liabilities of Emperor Star were transferred to the Company at their respective carrying amounts on the date of transaction. The Company has recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of Emperor Star’s common shares as if the restructuring transaction had occurred as of the earliest date of the consolidated financial statements. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. The nature of and effects on earnings per share (EPS) of non-recurring intra-entity transactions involving long-term assets and liabilities is not required to be eliminated and EPS amounts have been recast to include the earnings (or losses) of the transferred net assets.

  

The functional currency of the subsidiaries in Taiwan is the New Taiwan dollars and the subsidiary in People’s Republic of China is the Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi; however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, “$”, “US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, “NT$” and “NT dollars” mean New Taiwan dollars, and “RMB” means Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

 

Accounts Receivable 

 

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are generally due for settlement within 90 days and therefore all classified as current. Accounts receivable are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables. Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of allowance for expected credit losses. 

 

Inventory

 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value (NRV) is defined as estimated selling prices less costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventory consists mainly of finished goods held for resale. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. The Company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has become obsolete or has declined in value, and incurs a charge to operations for known and anticipated inventory obsolescence.

Property and Equipment 

 

Property and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized. When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method, including property and equipment under capital leases, generally over five years. Depreciation expense was $241 and $192 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360-10”). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Impairment loss on property and equipment was $nil and $nil for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Pursuant to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines is within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services the Company transfers to the customers. At inception of the contract, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 

 

Merchandise sales: The Company recognizes sales revenues from merchandise sales when customers obtain control of the Company’s products, which typically occurs upon delivery to customer. Merchandise sales revenues are recorded at the sales price, or “transaction price”. 

 

Software sales: The Company does not develop the software products on its own. When the Company receives a purchase order from the customer, the Company would engage with the third-party software company to customize and develop the software products. The Company recognizes software revenues upon completion of the installation and testing, and transfer the control of the software products to the customer. Software revenues are recorded at the fixed sales price, or “transaction price”, pursuant to the sales contracts. The Company may also charge the customer maintenance service fees on a straight-line basis over the service period pursuant to the sales contract. The Company concluded that the performance obligation for the maintenance service is distinct. Therefore, such maintenance service revenue can be separated from other elements in the arrangement.

 

Trade discount and allowances: The Company generally does not provide invoice discounts on product sales to its customers for prompt payment. 

 

Product returns: The Company generally does not provide customers with the right to return a product for a full or partial refund, a credit, or an exchange for another product. 

 

 

                                                                  F-8



  

To date, product allowance and returns have been minimal and, based on its experience, the Company believes that returns of its products will continue to be minimal.

Revenue from external customers

 

The Company’s customers are mainly located in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Leases

 

The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective approach, electing the practical expedient that allows the Company not to restate its comparative periods prior to the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2019. As such, the disclosures required under ASC 842 are not presented for periods before the date of adoption. For the comparative periods prior to adoption, the Company presented the disclosures which were required under ASC 842. 

 

The new leasing standard requires recognition of leases on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company’s future minimum based payments used to determine the Company’s lease liabilities mainly include minimum based rent payments. As most of Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

 

  

                                                                  F-9



 

In addition, the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. 

 

Advertising Costs 

 

Advertising costs are expensed at the time such advertising commences. Advertising expenses were $nil and $nil for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The Company calculates the fair value of option grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimates the fair value of the stock based upon the estimated fair value of the common stock.

 

In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”). ASU 2018-07 expands the guidance in ASC 718 to include share-based payments for goods and services to non-employees and generally aligns it with the guidance for share-based payments to employees. In accordance with ASU 2018-07, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the underlying equity instrument. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional-paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.

 

Post-retirement and Post-employment Benefits 

 

The Company’s subsidiaries in Taiwan adopted the government mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Taiwan Labor Pension Act (the “Act”). Such labor regulations require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the worker’s monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, the Company makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees’ salaries to the employees’ pension fund. The Company has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $961 and $1,175 for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits. 

 

                                                                  F-10





   

Fair Value Measurements 

 

FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” defines fair value for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price, maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. It establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:

 

Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available.

 

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

 

Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 

The carrying values of certain assets and liabilities of the Company, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and due to shareholders, approximate fair value because of to their relatively short maturities. 

 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

 

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents, and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each year. Dilutive shares are excluded the exercise price is greater than the average market price and when the Company incurred a net loss as the inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, warrants were excluded as dilutive shares as the Company incurred a net loss.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

 

Foreign-currency Transactions

 

Foreign-currency transactions are recorded in New Taiwan dollars (“NTD”) and Renminbi (“RMB”) at the rates of exchange in effect when the transactions occur. Gains or losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when cash in foreign currency is converted into New Taiwan dollars and Renminbi, or when foreign-currency receivables or payables are settled, are credited or charged to income in the year of conversion or settlement. On the balance sheet dates, the balances of foreign-currency assets and liabilities are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under stockholders’ equity.

 

Translation Adjustment 

 

The accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries were maintained, and their financial statements were expressed in New Taiwan Dollar (“NTD”) and Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi (“RMB”). Such financial statements were translated into U.S. Dollars (“$” or “USD”) in accordance ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”, with the NTD and RMB as the functional currency. According to the Statement, all assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, common stock and additional paid-in capital are translated at the historical rates, and income statement items are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity.

 

 

                                                                  F-11



 

 

Comprehensive Income (loss)

 

Comprehensive income (loss) includes accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses. The Company has reported the components of comprehensive income (loss) on its consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).

Credit risk

 

(i) Risk management

 

The Company reviews the recoverability of its financial assets periodically to ensure that potential credit risk of the counterparty is managed at an early stage and sufficient provision for impairment allowance is made for possible defaults. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.

 

As of 31 March 2024 and 31 December 2023, substantially all of the Group’s bank balances are deposited in major financial institutions. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these banks. The credit quality of bank balances has been assessed by reference to external credit ratings or to historical information about the counterparty default rates. The existing counterparties do not have defaults in the past.

 

The credit risk of the Group’s other financial assets, which comprises amounts advances to suppliers and security deposits and prepaid expenses and other current assets, arises from default of the counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amounts of these instruments.

 

(ii) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrument

 

The Company has Accounts receivable under Financial Instrument that are subject to the Measurement of Credit Losses.

 

The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” on January 1, 2023 using a modified retrospective approach. To estimate expected credit losses, the Company has identified the relevant risk characteristics of its customers and the related receivables. The Company considers the past collection experience, current economic conditions, future economic conditions (external data and macroeconomic factors) and changes in the Company’s customer collection trends. The provision for impairment loss and corresponding receivables were written off when they are determined to be uncollectible.).

Concentration of Credit Risk 

 

Cash and cash equivalents: The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions in Taiwan, but these investments may be in excess of the insurance limits of Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “TCDIC”) NT$ 3 million. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and notes receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company transacts business, as well as their dispersion across many geographical areas. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $nil in excess of TCDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

 

Customers: The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. 

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, two customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This pronouncement, along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In developing the estimate for lifetime expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. On November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), finalized various effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses (CECL). The Company has adopted this accounting standard in the financial year 2023, this new accounting standard has no significant impact to the Company. 

 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.

 

Note 2. LEASE

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has operating lease agreement for its photocopier with remaining lease terms of 30 months, and office lease with remaining lease terms of 9 months, respectively. The Company does not have any other leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components of its leases as a single lease component. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based primarily on its lease term in Taiwan which is approximately 2.44%.

 

Operating lease expenses were $8,774 and $16,479 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had net losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and had negative working capital and accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations. Management has financed its operating costs with loans from director and officers. The Company intends to generate sufficient revenue and raise additional funds to support its operations, however there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds.

 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

 

                                                                  F-14

Note 11. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

 

Freely Tradable Common Stock 

 

On September 7, 2023, the Company issued 21,000,000 shares common stock to various non-employee consultants as compensation for services rendered. As these services were fully provided by September 30, 2023, deferral of share based compensation is not necessary. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, the fair value of the issued stock was determined using Level 3 Inputs.

 

The decision to use Level 3 Inputs was driven by management's assessment that Level 1 Inputs, namely the Company’s stock price on the OTC Pink market, do not accurately represent the realizable value for consultants upon liquidation of their shares in this market. Additionally, Level 2 Inputs, which include prices of similarly situated companies on the OTC Pink market, were also deemed unsuitable. This decision was based on the unique circumstances surrounding the Company.

 

Consequently, management elected to use Level 3 Inputs, employing a discounted cash flow model, to more accurately estimate the fair value of the Company's stock granted to the consultants. This resulted in recording the stock-based compensation at an amount of $41,019. This approach reflects a comprehensive assessment of the stock’s fair value, considering the specific context and market conditions relevant to the Company.

 

Restricted Stock

 

On May 19, 2022, the Company issued 3,601,306 shares of restricted common stock to non-employees, the amount is recorded as deferred (unearned) compensation of $38,534, due to the service has not been started. The fair value of the shares was determined based on a contemporaneous valuation report.

 

On May 19, 2022, the Company issued 115,000 shares of restricted common stock to non-employees as compensation in the amount of $1,231. The shares were fully vested upon issuance as there were no other conditions required for the shares to vest. The fair value of the shares was determined based on a contemporaneous valuation report. 

 

Warrants

 

On February 3, 2022, the Company granted the issuance of warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2 per share with an expiration date of December 22, 2027 to a consultant or its designees as compensation. The warrants were fully vested upon issuance as there were no other conditions required for the warrants to vest. 

 

In accordance to ASC 815-40, an equity-linked financial instrument can be classified in equity only if it (1) is indexed to the reporting entity’s own stock and (2) meets all other conditions for equity classification. The warrants are classified as equity instruments because a fixed amount of cash is exchanged for a fixed amount of equity.

 

The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions, the expected life of the warrants, and the expected stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards.

 

The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Warrants as follows:

 

                                                                                                               Years Ended            

                                                                                                              December 31,            

                                                                                                         2023             2022      

Expected life (years)                                                                                         3.89             4.89 

                                                                                                                      

Risk-free interest rate                                                                                       0.76%            0.76%

Expected volatility                                                                                         329.86%          329.86%

Dividend yield                                                                                                   0%               0%

 

The expected life of the warrants was estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company has no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns for its warrant grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The expected life of awards that vest immediately use the contractual maturity since they are vested when issued. 

 

For stock price volatility, the Company calculated its expected volatility based on historical closing price of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the warrant at the grant-date.

 

Stock based compensation were $nil and $nil for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Note 12. INCOME TAXES

 

The Company has operations in various countries and is subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows:

 

United States

 

EOS, Inc. is incorporated in the United States of America and is subject to United States federal taxation at tax rate of 21%. No provisions for income taxes have been made as the Company has no taxable income for the period. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $1,668,312 that may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements as their realization is determined not likely to occur and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. No tax benefit has been realized since a 100% valuation allowance has offset deferred tax asset resulting from the net operating losses.

 

 

                                                                  F-18

There was other income of $158,818 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a turnaround from other expense of $717 for the three months March 31, 2023. It was mainly due to that we recognized significant allowance for credit losses due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022, was $475,340, reflecting our estimate of potential losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions, and an assessment of specific customer credit risk. In FY2023, with relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, management undertook significant efforts to recover previously recognised credit losses, as a result, management recovered $148,452 of bad debts during 2023 and $129,364 in first quarter of 2024.

 

Net loss

 

As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $43,208 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to net loss of $130,137 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease in loss of $86,929 or 67%.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Cash and cash equivalents were $64,506 on March 31, 2024 and $14,307 at December 31, 2023. Our total current assets were $330,644 on March 31, 2024, as compared to $487,319 on December 31, 2023. Our total current liabilities were $1,373,599 on March 31, 2024, as compared to $1,494,230 at December 31, 2023.

 

We had a working capital deficit of $1,042,955 on March 31, 2024, compared to the working capital deficit of $1,006,911 on December 31, 2023. The enlarge in working capital deficit was primarily due to a reduction in sales and a reduction in accounts receivable.

 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $121,102 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating activities $98,218 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The turnaround was mainly due to more accounts receivable were settled in cash the period.

 

No investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,096 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Net cash used in financing activities was $55,087 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities $96,066 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The turnaround was mainly due to repayment to related party payable.

 

As a result of the above factors, net increase of cash and cash equivalents were $50,199 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to net decrease of $3,139 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Principles of Consolidation 

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the accounts of EOS Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries in Taiwan, British Virgin Islands, and People’s Republic of China, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Since the Company and Emperor Star are entities under common control prior to the acquisition of Emperor Star, the transaction is accounted for as a restructuring transaction. All assets and liabilities of Emperor Star were transferred to the Company at their respective carrying amounts on the date of transaction. The Company has recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of Emperor Star’s common shares as if the restructuring transaction had occurred as of the earliest date of the consolidated financial statements. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. The nature of and effects on earnings per share (EPS) of non-recurring intra-entity transactions involving long-term assets and liabilities is not required to be eliminated and EPS amounts have been recast to include the earnings (or losses) of the transferred net assets. 

 

The functional currency of the subsidiaries in Taiwan is the New Taiwan dollars and the subsidiary in People’s Republic of China is the Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi; however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, “$”, “US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, “NT$” and “NT dollars” mean New Taiwan dollars, and “RMB” means Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

 

Accounts Receivable 

 

Accounts receivable are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful. Such receivable becomes doubtful when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income, as are subsequent recoveries of previous impairments.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value (NRV) is defined as estimated selling prices less costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventory consists mainly of finished goods held for resale. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. The Company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has become obsolete or has declined in value, and incurs a charge to operations for known and anticipated inventory obsolescence. 

 

 

                                                                   5

 

 

Property and Equipment 

 

Property and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized. When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method, including property and equipment under capital leases, generally over five years. Depreciation expense was $241 and $192 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360-10”). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Impairment loss on property and equipment was $nil and $nil for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Pursuant to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines is within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services the Company transfers to the customers. At inception of the contract, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 

 

Merchandise sales: The Company recognizes sales revenues from merchandise sales when customers obtain control of the Company’s products, which typically occurs upon delivery to customer. Merchandise sales revenues are recorded at the sales price, or “transaction price”. 

 

Software sales: The Company does not develop the software products on its own. When the Company receives a purchase order from the customer, the Company would engage with the third-party software company to customize and develop the software products. The Company recognizes software revenues upon completion of the installation and testing, and transfer the control of the software products to the customer. Software revenues are recorded at the fixed sales price, or “transaction price”, pursuant to the sales contracts. The Company may also charge the customer maintenance service fees on a straight-line basis over the service period pursuant to the sales contract. The Company concluded that the performance obligation for the maintenance service is distinct. Therefore, such maintenance service revenue can be separated from other elements in the arrangement.

 

 

                                                                   6

 

 

Trade discount and allowances: The Company generally does not provide invoice discounts on product sales to its customers for prompt payment. 

 

Product returns: The Company generally does not provide customers with the right to return a product for a full or partial refund, a credit, or an exchange for another product. 

 

To date, product allowance and returns have been minimal and, based on its experience, the Company believes that returns of its products will continue to be minimal. 

 

Since COVID-19 pandemic hit globally in 2020 and throughout first three quarters of financial year ended December 31, 2021, management assessed that the market conditions that it operated in was worsening.  Credit risk on customers was determined to have deteriorated significantly as the majority of its customers were located in the PRC.  Accordingly, management took the position that revenue would only be recognized when the consideration is received as to satisfy revenue recognition criteria related to reasonable certainty of collections.

  

During the fourth quarter of financial year ended December 31, 2021, the Covid pandemic was effectively controlled in the PRC.  Management re-assessed the market conditions and determined that the overall market conditions were improving, and the Company’s collection history in the prior three quarters was positive, and in fourth quarter of 2021 reached sustainable recovery rate comparable to pre-COVID-19 environment. Accordingly, management decided that due to the improved conditions collection is now reasonably certain, and revenue is now recognized when risk and rewards are transferred to its customers.

 

The following tables provide details of revenue by major products and by geography.

Revenue from external customers

 

The Company’s customers are mainly located in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024:

For the three months ended March 31, 2023:

Leases

 

The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective approach, electing the practical expedient that allows the Company not to restate its comparative periods prior to the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2019. As such, the disclosures required under ASC 842 are not presented for periods before the date of adoption. For the comparative periods prior to adoption, the Company presented the disclosures which were required under ASC 842. 

 

The new leasing standard requires recognition of leases on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company’s future minimum based payments used to determine the Company’s lease liabilities mainly include minimum based rent payments. As most of Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

  

In addition, the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. 

 

Advertising Costs 

 

Advertising costs are expensed at the time such advertising commences. Advertising expenses were $nil and $nil for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The Company calculates the fair value of option grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimates the fair value of the stock based upon the estimated fair value of the common stock.

 

In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”). ASU 2018-07 expands the guidance in ASC 718 to include share-based payments for goods and services to non-employees and generally aligns it with the guidance for share-based payments to employees. In accordance with ASU 2018-07, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the underlying equity instrument. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional-paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.

 

Post-retirement and Post-employment Benefits 

 

The Company’s subsidiaries in Taiwan adopted the government mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Taiwan Labor Pension Act (the “Act”). Such labor regulations require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the worker’s monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, the Company makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees’ salaries to the employees’ pension fund. The Company has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $961 and $1,175 for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits. 

 

 

                                                                   8

 

Fair Value Measurements 

 

FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” defines fair value for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price, maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. It establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:

 

     ·    Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to

           access at the measurement date. Valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations

           are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly

           available.

 

     ·    Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the

           measurement date, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or

           other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the

           assets or

           liabilities.

 

     ·    Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. The fair value for such

           assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar

           techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or

           liability.

 

The carrying values of certain assets and liabilities of the Company, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, advance to suppliers, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and due to shareholders, approximate fair value because of to their relatively short maturities. 

 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

 

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents, and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each year. Dilutive shares are excluded the exercise price is greater than the average market price and when the Company incurred a net loss as the inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, warrants were excluded as dilutive shares as the Company incurred a net loss.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

 

 

                                                                   9

 

 

Foreign-currency Transactions

 

Foreign-currency transactions are recorded in New Taiwan dollars (“NTD”) and Renminbi (“RMB”) at the rates of exchange in effect when the transactions occur. Gains or losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when cash in foreign currency is converted into New Taiwan dollars and Renminbi, or when foreign-currency receivables or payables are settled, are credited or charged to income in the year of conversion or settlement. On the balance sheet dates, the balances of foreign-currency assets and liabilities are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under stockholders’ equity.

 

Translation Adjustment 

 

The accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries were maintained, and their financial statements were expressed in New Taiwan Dollar (“NTD”) and Chinese Yuan, or Renminbi (“RMB”). Such financial statements were translated into U.S. Dollars (“$” or “USD”) in accordance ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”, with the NTD and RMB as the functional currency. According to the Statement, all assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, common stock and additional paid-in capital are translated at the historical rates, and income statement items are translated at an average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity.

 

Comprehensive Income (loss)

 

Comprehensive income (loss) includes accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses. The Company has reported the components of comprehensive income (loss) on its consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).

 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

 

Cash and cash equivalents: The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions in Taiwan, but these investments may be in excess of the insurance limits of Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “TCDIC”) NT$ 3 million. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and notes receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company transacts business, as well as their dispersion across many geographical areas. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $nil in excess of TCDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

 

Customers: The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This pronouncement, along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify provisions of ASU 2016-13, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In developing the estimate for lifetime expected credit loss, entities must incorporate historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. On November 19, 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), finalized various effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses (CECL), the revised effective date is January 2023.

 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, management identified material weaknesses related to (i) our internal audit functions (ii) inadequate levels of review of the financial statements, (iii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions and (iv) the absence of any independent directors. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of March 31, 2024. 

 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

Material Weaknesses and Corrective Actions 

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter to which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

 

We are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, or proceeding by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or our subsidiary, threatened against or affecting our Company, our common stock, our subsidiary or of our companies or our subsidiary’s officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.
