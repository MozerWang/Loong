CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Goldenwell Biotech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “expects”, “plans”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements. The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things to product demand, market and customer acceptance, competition, pricing, climate change, pandemics, political changes, and development difficulties, as well as general industry and market conditions and growth rates and general economic conditions; and other factors discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

 

Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management’s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

March 31, 2024

 

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

GOLDENWELL BIOTECH INC. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2019. The company address is 581 Boston Mills Road, Suite 300, Hudson, Ohio 44236, The Company is in the development stage whose purpose is R&D, production and sales health cares and supplements products.

 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has sustained an accumulated net loss of $1,258,658 since its inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.

 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

 

Use of estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 

Start-Up Costs

 

In accordance with ASC 720, “Start-up Costs”, the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company.

 

Cash 

 

Cash includes cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. 

 

 

                                                                   8

Income Taxes

 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.  

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.

 

The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

 

Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 

Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable

 

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)

 

The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.

 

NOTE 4 - LEASE ACCOUNTING 

 

Effective January 15, 2021, the Company entered into a 3-year lease for corporate office which requires 36 monthly payments of $1,949.25, payable at the beginning of each monthly rental period. The lease is classified as an operating lease as the lease does not transfer ownership of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term, there is no purchase option, the lease terms is not for the major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, and the present value of future lease payments does not exceed substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.  Accordingly, at commencement, the Company recognized a right of use asset and a lease liability based upon the present value of lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at lease commencement. 

 

The company classifies the right-of-use asset as non-current for the entire lease term. The company classifies the portion of the liability due within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer, with current liability, and the rest with noncurrent liability.

 

The interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable and management estimated its incremental borrowing rate to be 2% by referencing the information from the current lending market and the costs of borrowing disclosed by some guideline public companies. 

 

On December 31, 2022, the company reached an agreement with the lessor to terminate the lease. No early termination fee was charged. Undiscounted cash flows on an annual basis related to this lease was $25,372 by December 31, 2022.

 

 

                                                                   9

Income tax benefit at statutory rate                                                                    $      (6,505)       (24,548)

Change in valuation allowance                                                                                   6,505         24,548

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company’s net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2024 is as follows:

 

                                                                                                          March 31,    December 31,  

                                                                                                             2024           2023

Net operating loss carry forward                                                                        $     264,318        257,813 

Valuation allowance                                                                                          (264,318)      (257,813)

Net deferred tax assets                                                                                             —              — 

 

The Company has approximately $1,258,658 of net operating losses (“NOL”) carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2040. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 

The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Goldenwell Biotech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Form 10-K (File No. 000-56275; the “Form 10-K”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12, 2024. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute “forward-looking” statements.

 

OVERVIEW

 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2019, and established a fiscal year end of December 31.

 

Going Concern

 

To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. Substantially greater revenues are not anticipated until we complete the financing we endeavor to obtain, as described in this Form 10-K, and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Our activities have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions. On August 20, 2019 the Company sold 41,000,000 shares of common stock to its founders for a subscription amount of $41,000. On August 20, 2019, the Company sold 39,000,000 shares of common stock for a subscription amount of $215,504.

 

We have an outstanding related-party loan of $100,000.

 

The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings.

 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results:

 

Basis of Accounting

 

The Company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and are presented in United States Dollars.

 

 

                                                                   12



Table of Contents

 

Basic Earnings (loss) per Share

 

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock.

 

Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.

 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.

 

Income Taxes

 

Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

 

Foreign Currency Translation

 

The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Occasional transactions may occur in Chinese Renminbi or Australian Dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of net income (loss).

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The carrying amount of cash and current liabilities approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

 

Start-Up expenses

 

As a start-up company, the costs associated with start-up activities are expensed as incurred. Accordingly, start-up costs associated with the Company’s formation have been included in the Company’s general and administrative expenses.

 

 

                                                                   13



Table of Contents

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major repairs and betterments are capitalized and normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

PLAN OF OPERATION

 

We are an early stage corporation and have generated of only $382 and $2,080 of revenues from sales of our nutraceutical and dietary supplements business during the three months periods ended March 31, 2024.

 

Our plan of operation for the 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is to increase the sales of our products.

 

The Company believes it can satisfy its cash requirements through the fiscal year end of December 31, 2023, from its cash of $11,920 as of September 30, 20203. As of March 31, 2024, we had a working capital balance of $105,523.

 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 as compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023:

 

We recorded revenues of $158 and $1,422, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $31,056 as compared to $34,317 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to auditing fees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 

We recorded net losses of $30,977 and $33,606, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

At March 31, 2024, we had a cash balance of $24,211 and total current liabilities of $145,222. Our working capital deficit at March 31, 2024, was $121,011. We sufficient cash on hand to fund our ongoing operational expenses through December 31, 2023. 

 

Material hurdles remain until we can increase sales of our products. First, we must construct manufacturing facilities, which includes locating a site, installing a workshop and setting up equipment. No special equipment needs to be engineered or produced. All needed equipment is presently available from existing manufacturers. Second, our workforce will need to be trained, however, no specialized education or experience is needed by labor we intend to hire.  We estimate that we need approximately $5,000,000 to complete such activities and that it would take approximately one year to complete such activities.  Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock, if we are able to sell such stock. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our activities. In the absence of such financing, our business will fail.   There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue the expansion of our business.

 

At March 31, 2024, our total assets were $198,968 consisting of cash of $24,221, and inventory of $174,746.

 

At March 31, 2024, our current and total liabilities were $145,222, and stockholders’ equity was $198,968.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who acts as our principal executive officer) and our Secretary (who acts as our principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Secretary concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules, regulations and forms, and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and our Secretary, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Secretary, has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during this quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

 

 

                                                                   15
