Notes to Condensed Financial Statements

March 31, 2024

(Unaudited)

Back to Table of Contents

 

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Organization, Ownership and Business

 

Data Call Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2002. The Company’s mission is to integrate cutting-edge information delivery solutions that are currently deployed by the media, and put them within the control of retail and commercial enterprises. The Company’s software and services put its clients in control of real-time advertising, news, and other content, including emergency alerts.

 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three-month period ending March 31, 2024 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 

As contemplated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Rules of Regulation S-X, the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes have been condensed and do not contain certain information that will be included in the Company’s annual financial statements and footnotes thereto. For further information, refer to the Company’s audited financial statements and related footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Revenue Recognition. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2018.

 

Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

 

We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:

 

●         identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

           

●         identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

           

●         determination of the transaction price;

           

●         allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

           

●         recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

 

Company recognizes revenues based on monthly fees for services provided to customers. Some customers prepay for annual services and the Company defers such amounts and amortizes them into revenues as the service is provided.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful trade receivables equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. That estimate is based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer’s trade accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful trade receivables was $0 as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, as we believe all of our receivables are fully collectable.

 

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resultant gain or loss being recognized as a component of other income or expense. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets (3-5 years) using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

 

                                                                   8                                                                    



                                                         

 

Advertising Costs

 

The cost of advertising was $0.

 

Research and Development

 

Research and development costs were $0.

 

Product Development Costs

 

Product development costs consist of cost incurred to develop the Company’s website and software for internal and external use. All system enhancement costs were accumulated and on the balance sheet for a total of $100,000.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company is a taxable entity and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date of the rate change. A valuation allowance is used to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U. S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could vary from those estimates.

 

Management’s Estimates and Assumptions

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.

 

Stock-based Compensation.

 

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with “FASB ASC 718-10.” Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period.

 

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share Calculations

 

Income (Loss) per Share dictates the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The share for convertible preferred shares were used in the calculation of the income per share.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company has excluded 800,000 series A preferred shares convertible into 579,710,145 shares of common stock.

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company has excluded 800,000 series A preferred shares convertible into 579,710,145 shares of common stock, During the three months ended Marh 31, 2023, the above-mentioned shares are not included in the calculation for diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s net loss because their impact on the loss per share is anti-dilutive.

 

Dilutive per share amounts are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock method if their effect would be dilutive.

 

                                                                   9                                                                    



                                                         

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the Company estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumption and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The interest rates payable by the Company on its notes payable approximate market rates. The Company believes that the fair value of its financial instruments comprising accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, and notes payable approximate their carrying amounts.

 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

 

Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

 

The following table presents the Company’s Assets & Liabilities within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

 

The Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on results of operations,

 

(2) Going Concern

 

Although our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital from becoming available, based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically, as noted above, we have incurred an operating loss this year and have negative working capital. There are no assurances that such financing, if necessary, will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

                                                                   10

Overview - What Is Digital Signage?

 

You’ve seen Digital Signage, it’s everywhere. Whether you’re shopping, trying to find your way through the airport, in a taxi, or even along the highway on your way home, it’s there. LED and LCD displays are continually replacing printed marketing materials such as signs and placards, as well as the old-school whiteboard, for product and corporate branding, marketing and assisted selling. The appeal of instantly updating product videos and promotional messages on one or thousands of remotely located displays is driving the adoption of this growing marketing platform. Digital Signage presentations are typically comprised of repeating loops (playlists) of information used to brand, market or sell the owner’s products and services or corporate messaging. But once viewed, this information becomes repetitive and the viewer tunes it out, resulting in low retention of the client’s message. As digital signage has matured, the characteristics of the digital signage presentations have taken center-stage requiring fresh, relevant and dynamic content mixed within the marketing messages. Dynamic Content is key.

 

Digital Signage Matures

 

We are experiencing the Digital Signage Industry (back then called connected signage) steadily maturing and Data Call, through its multiple industry specific relationships, continues its engagement and influence in the direction of the Digital Signage industry. Data Call has been performing in this space for well over a decade. Our company has staked claim in assisting the industry’s birth and maintains its prime position to enjoy and benefit from this industry’s growth.

 

Early on, a business desiring to achieve commercial benefits from the use of digital signage was often confronted by a plethora of hardware and software solutions, all offering their own “standard” of what digital signage should be. Typical customers for digital signage were most-often offered expensive hardware to present digital signage with a very minimalistic content management solution (CMS), lacking the full package of content with which to build and tailor their systems for their target customer base.

 

Those early adopters of digital signage, often had to realize that their digital signage hardware vendors lacked the acumen to fully provide best practice of content strategy. The tools to manage content were provided, but not the content. From our inception, Data Call recognized that early signage providers and their typical customers lacked that key component - the offering of a comprehensive content package.

 

As the cost of platforms supporting infrastructure and digital displays have fallen significantly, digital signage has become more accessible to a wider range of potential users. Companies in our industry have come to understand, as we have preached since our inception, that the cost of Data Call’s integrated, content-flexible subscription service is extremely cost effective - and licensed for redistribution over their networks. The benefit that Data Call continues to provide our client base, in the form of ongoing content development, is expected to continue to provide our customers with desirable user-friendly content and content services.

 

The Need for Speed - Active Content

 

Active and dynamic content is an integral part of digital signage presentations that must be constantly updated with timely and relevant information to attract and retain target viewers to the products, services, or messaging offered by typical Digital Signage clients. For instance, a typical presentation may contain ten 15-second loops that provide the primary message of the presentation, but the active dynamic content, such as that provided by Data Call, is updated with new information constantly throughout the day. Those seeking to add active and dynamic content to their digital signage presentations are educated and advised to subscribe to Data Call’s dynamic content rather than attempting to illegally “cut and paste” or “scrape” broadcast content or RSS Feeds “not for commercial use” of others into their digital signage presentation.

 

                                                                   13                                                                   



                                                         

 

By integrating Data Call’s content as a meaningful component of digital signage presentations, our clients can legally provide the entertainment and information content necessary to enhance the target customer’s information retention without disrupting the core message of the presentation. Some of the Infotainment categories provided by Data Call include news, sports, weather, financial data, the latest traffic alerts, among many others. With such a broad range of offerings, our clients have access to this active and dynamic content they need, regardless of the target customers and market they are addressing.

 

Our Business Opportunities

 

Our many opportunities for client development in the digital signage industry are growing exponentially. While many companies in our industry have traditionally outsourced all or part of their content creation, Data Call serves as a provider of dynamic active content to clients on a tailored basis. Whether a client desires general entertainment information for customers, such as news, sports, stock market quotes, etc. or location-specific content, such as local weather, traffic, etc., our research and experience has validated our long-held mantra that dynamic content draws and retains our clients’ target viewers to their digital signage and keeps viewers engaged throughout the client presentation.

 

Since our inception, management has developed and maintains strong relationships working with the leaders and associations of the digital signage industry. Collaborative efforts have successfully created, now industry standard, data formats and methods to facilitate the delivery of our dynamic content more easily and efficiently for integration into most hardware and software products.

 

Partners, Not Customers

 

Data Call’s enduring approach to our clients is to build long-lasting partnerships by creating client relationships that we believe are unique in the digital signage industry. We understand that each client has their own content requirements. In developing dynamic content for individual digital signage clients, we have identified three content-related factors: (i) reliability; (ii) objectivity; and (iii) ease of implementation. To address the reliability requirement, we are engaged in multiple license arrangements with the leading providers of news, weather, sports and financial information, among other client-desired content rather than either: (i) downloading and repackaging content sourced from the Internet (which may be illegal); or (ii) Scraping RSS feeds from news organizations (which may come and go at the provider’s whim - not to mention this practice is also illegal).

 

Licensing data from these premier providers has also served us by satisfying the second criteria, objectivity. Because it is commonly recognized that Internet content may often be unreliable, unverifiable and biased, early on, we determined that we could not simply use unfiltered Internet content for delivery to our clients. Our proper licensing of data facilitates the standard of delivery and implementation by our client/partners. Data Call does the heavy lifting by taking care of not just the licensing, but the proper formatting of that data for consumption by the industry utilizing our multiple formats offered. Data Call has understood that it’s Digital Signage and Kiosk clients needed a more complete service than to endeavor the sourcing of active content from multiple vendors. As a result, our flexible content plans permit our clients to do “one stop shopping” for all dynamic content requirements by licensing subscriptions through us.

 

We empower our clients to receive customized dynamic content subscriptions to be displayed in a multitude of ways (banners, tickers, scrolls or visualizations integrated with the overall presentations). We have created “Playlist Ready” offerings and produced and distribute multiple sets of common data layouts in the industry-standard formats such as XML (extensible markup language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), RSS (Rich Site Summary, often called Really Simple Syndication), MRSS (Media RSS) and MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group). With the advent of HTML5 (5th version of Hypertext Markup Language), even more delivery methods have been made available to our clients, many of whom have found any one or a combination of these formats to be easily integrated into their products. Nevertheless, we have also produced customized data formats and visualizations to the exact and specific requirements of our clients/partners, which, we believe ensures a higher level of reliability and ease of implementation.

 

                                                                   14



 

 

Market demand, opportunity and technology converge at a single point in time, and Data Call continues hold its position. Our integrity persistently builds our business. Digital signage platforms steadily evolve to meet mass market requirements, costs for hardware and software are falling to the point of becoming commodities and the markets for digital signage are clarifying through historical trial and error.

 

Business Operations

 

In March of 2017, we released our Direct Lynk Manager (DLManager) customer portal at the Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. The DLManager incorporates the Direct Lynk Media platform with major enhancements and options that enable the client to self-serve in a webstore environment. This is a moderated space that allows proper “white glove” treatment by our staff that our clients have come to expect and appreciate. Once the client is comfortable with navigation of the portal, they may then set up multiple groups and displays within their account for testing results in a demo fashion free of charge. Upon completion of their content selections and distribution points, the client may purchase the proper number of licenses needed to support their sections through various plans offered within the portal.

 

Some of the current types of data and information, for which a client may subscribe to through the Direct Lynk System, in multiple formats include:

 

-    Headline News top world and national news headlines;

-    Business News top business headlines;

-    Financial Highlights world-based financial indicators;

-    Entertainment News top entertainment headlines;

-    Health/Science News top science/health headlines;

                                                                   15



 

 

We continually add different types of content per client requests. We provide our DLM services to our clients and other potential customers through the Internet. All DLM Services are real-time information services providing a wide range of up-to-date information for display. These services are designed to work concurrently with customers’ existing digital signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product is scheduled to be sunset within the next 12 months, as DLMedia gradually moves into a legacy status with the DLManager portal taking the forefront.

 

Since our inception in 2002, we have come to deeply understand that this industry provides an exciting platform for advertisers, including our clients, to promote, inform, educate, and entertain their customers and employees regarding their business products, services, and corporate communications. Through Digital Signage, and Digital Out of Home (DOOH) businesses can use a single display or a complex, networked series of displays and video walls to market their products and services directly at their facilities and elsewhere to their customers and employees in real time. Additionally, because the core of Digital Signage advertising takes place in real time, businesses can change their marketing and messaging efforts literally from moment to moment and over the course of a day or such other period as they may determine.

 

We believe that the ability of our clients to display in real-time, the information and content we deliver, better allows our clients to tailor their products, services, advertising and messaging to individual and target-group customers, thereby advertising and offering, for example, inventory and sales discounts that may be designed to appeal to those individual customers and target customer groups, increasing sales and revenues. We believe that the benefits of on-site, real-time Digital Signage displays compared to regular print or video advertising are substantial and include, among other advantages, being able to immediately change digitally displayed images/advertisements depending on our client’s customers own situation, not simply being restricted by in-store print circulars produced days, weeks or even months in advance, which may become stale or obsolete prior to or shortly after publication and dissemination.

 

We specialize in enabling our clients to create their own Digital Signage content feeds which are delivered online directly to their chosen, electronic digital display devices at their various facilities. The only requirements our clients must have are: (i) a supported, third-party Digital Signage or Kiosk equipment solution - through a CMS or a standalone player, or similar device, which receives the data from our servers online; and (ii) an Internet connection. Our DLM System is supported by various, readily available third-party systems, varying in costs from inexpensive monthly cloud-based licenses to much more extensive and expensive content management/playback systems. Our Systems allow customers to select from their pre-determined data and information subscriptions offered. We enable our clients to also select location specific content they wish to receive based on how and where their Digital Signage network is configured.

 

In December of 2017 the company completed the arduous task of reconstructing our back-end systems architecture. This task was initialized to exploit the latest technology advances within our space, utilizing our data center efficiencies to further streamline our processes. One of the greater culminations of this effort yielded the Data Call API (Application Programming Interface) allowing our enterprise channel partners to embed our products within their offerings to further widen our reach.

 

Data Call continues to grow its client base through relationships that are gained through industry events such as seminars and trade shows. Our company has become a leader in syndicated content and custom content development for Digital Signage. Our licensed content is utilized on thousands of screens in hundreds of deployments. We are truly excited of our continued growth through our resellers, CMS manufacturers and end users.

 

Results of Operations

 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements.

 

During the last twelve months, the Company has implemented cost management measurements to review monthly expenditures. We will continue these efforts to streamline operations, as we focus on increasing sales and gross revenues over the next twelve months. We do not currently have any plans to increase our monthly expenditures or number of employees. We currently offer our Direct Lynk Messenger and DLMedia services to our clients and other potential customers through the Internet. Both DLM Services are Digital Signage products and real-time information services which provides a wide range of up-to-date information for display. Both DLM services are able to work concurrently with customers’ existing digital signage systems. The Direct Lynk Messenger product is slowly becoming a legacy product with the DLMedia product in the forefront.

We continually add subscribers for our technology throughout and intend to build and increase such subscribers moving forward.

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023

 

Our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $138,536 compared to $139,067 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $531 or .382% during the same period in the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to not all of the renewals being completed during the first quarter of the new year.

 

Costs of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $52,726 compared to $50,087 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $2,639. Costs of sales increased due to the amount of bandwidth required to provide the subscription services.

 

Gross margins for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $85,810 compared to $88,980, or 61.9% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 64.0% for the three-month period ending March 31, 2023.

 

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $80,953 compared to $98,510 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $17,557 from the same period in the prior year. The decrease in SG&A expenses is mainly due to a decrease in expenses and a reduction in the costs of stock. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $4,613 compared to a net loss of $9,771 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. The Company’s increase in net income was due to the reduction of expenses.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We had total current assets of $60,525 consisting of $6,432 of cash and $54,093 in accounts receivable. As of March 31, 2024, we had total current liabilities of $102,796, which represented $49,906 in accounts payable, and accrued payables related party of $52,890.

 

We had negative working capital of $42,271 and an accumulated deficit of $9,979,855 on March 31, 2024.

 

The Company had net cash provided by (used in) $(29,877) of cash for our operating activities during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, which was mainly due to a net income of $4,613, accounts payable related party of $28,519, other current liabilities of $23,106, accounts receivables of $(28,735), accrued expenses of $1,364, depreciation of $245 and deferred revenue of $(42,335).

 

Due to our declining financial position, we do see a need to raise additional funds. We will continue to generate revenues and generate new revenues to try support our operations.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Back to Table of Contents

 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

 

Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024 (the “Evaluation Date”). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

Our principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) or in other factors that occurred during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, that have significantly affected, or are reasonably likely to significantly affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

                                                                   18
