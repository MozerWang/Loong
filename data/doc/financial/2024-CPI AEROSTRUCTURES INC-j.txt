NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

 

 1.        INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The Company consists of CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI Aero”), Welding Metallurgy, Inc. (“WMI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CPI Aero, and Compac Development Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of WMI (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).

 

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

 

All adjustments that, in the opinion of the management, are necessary for a fair presentation for the periods presented have been reflected. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period.

 

An operating segment, in part, is a component of an enterprise whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Operating segments may be aggregated only to a limited extent. The Company’s CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company has determined that it has a single operating and reportable segment.

 

The Company maintains its cash in multiple financial institutions. The balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. From time to time, the Company’s balances may exceed insurance limits. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $2,806,594 of uninsured balances. The Company limits its credit risk by selecting financial institutions considered to be highly creditworthy.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards – Not Adopted

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity (“PBE”) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all period presented. We expect this ASU to only impact our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

Favorable/(Unfavorable) Adjustments to Gross Profit 

 

We review our Estimates at Completion (“EAC”) at least quarterly. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among others.

 

Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.

 

Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

3.           CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

 

Contract assets represent revenue recognized on contracts in excess of amounts invoiced to the customers and the Company’s right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Under the typical payment terms of our government as well as military contractor contracts, the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, as a measure of protection for the customer. Our government and military contractor contracts therefore typically result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, which we present as contract assets. Contract assets are classified as current assets. The Company’s contract liabilities represent customer payments received or due from the customer in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as current liabilities.

The Company grants shares of common stock (“Performance Restricted Stock Awards” or “PRSAs”) to select officers as part of our long-term incentive program that will result in that number of PRSAs being paid out if the target performance metric is achieved. The award vesting is based on specific performance metrics related to accounts payable delinquency, debt, and net income during the performance period. The PRSAs vest at 0% or 100% and all three metrics must be met to vest at 100%. The PRSAs granted under this program will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, subject to the aforementioned performance criteria. At March 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining amortization period was 2.5 years.

10.       INCOME TAXES

 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

The provision for income tax for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $39,472 and $199,257, respectively. The decrease in the year-over-year provision for income tax is the result of the Company’s lower year over year pre-tax book income.

 

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is 19.0%. The difference between the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the statutory income tax rate of 21.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is due primarily to the estimated R&D credit, state income taxes and permanent tax differences. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 16.8%. The difference between the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the statutory income tax rate of 21% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due to the estimated R&D credit, state income taxes and permanent tax differences.

  

 

11.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

The Company may be involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues a liability when it is both probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company’s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company’s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period such determination is made. For some matters, the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made.

Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this report.

 

Forward Looking Statements

 

When used in this Form 10-Q and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the words or phrases “will likely result,” “management expects” or “we expect,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimated” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The risks are included in Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.

 

Business Operations

 

We are engaged in the contract production of structural aircraft parts for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters in both the commercial and defense markets. We also have a strong and growing presence in the aerosystems sector of the market, with our production of various reconnaissance pod structures and fuel panel systems. Within the global aerostructure and aerosystem supply chain, we are either a Tier 1 supplier to aircraft original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) or a Tier 2 subcontractor to major Tier 1 manufacturers. We also are a prime contractor to the United States Department of Defense (“DOD”), primarily the United States Air Force (“USAF”). In conjunction with our assembly operations, we provide engineering, program management, supply chain management and kitting, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) services.

 

Recent Developments

 

None.

 

Backlog

 

We produce custom assemblies pursuant to long-term contracts and customer purchase orders. Funded backlog consists of aggregate funded values under such contracts and purchase orders, excluding the portion previously included in operating revenues pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). Unfunded backlog is the estimated amount of future orders under the expected duration of the programs. Substantially all of our backlog is subject to termination at will and rescheduling, without significant penalty. Funds are often appropriated for programs or contracts on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years. Therefore, our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts.

 

Our total backlog as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows:

 

          Backlog                 March 31,             December 31,

The total backlog at March 31, 2024 is primarily comprised of long-term programs with Raytheon (Next Generation Jammer (“NGJ”) – Mid Band Pods and Advanced Tactical Pods), Collins Aerospace (Airborne Reconnaissance Pods), USAF (T-38 Classic Structural Modification Kits), Lockheed Martin (F-16 RI/DCC’s), Raytheon (B-52 Radar Racks), Embraer (Phenom 300 Engine Inlets), Sikorsky (CH-53K Welded Tubes), Sikorsky (UH-60 BLACKHAWK Gunner Windows), Boeing (A-10 Main Landing Gear Pods) and Sikorsky (UH-60 BLACKHAWK Stabilator MRO).

 

The funded backlog at March 31, 2024 is primarily from purchase orders under long-term contracts with Raytheon (NGJ – Mid Band Pods), USAF (T-38 Classic Structural Modification Kits), Collins Aerospace (Airborne Reconnaissance Pods), Boeing (A-10 Main Landing Gear Pods), Sikorsky (CH-53K Welded Tubes), Sikorsky (UH-60 BLACKHAWK Gunner Windows), Lockheed Martin (F-16 RI/DCC’s), Embraer (Phenom 300 Engine Inlets) and Raytheon (Advanced Tactical Pods).

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

We make a number of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments in the preparation of our financial statements. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K, for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no significant changes to the application of our critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Other cost of sales relates to items that can increase or decrease cost of sales such as changes in inventory reserves, changes in loss contract provisions, absorption variances and direct charges to cost of sales. Other cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $97,490 compared to a $231,320 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $133,830 or 57.9%. The decrease is primarily the result of a higher level of loss contract reserve reduction for the for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Gross Profit

 

Gross profit and gross profit percentage (“gross margin”) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $3,553,749 and 18.6%, respectively, compared to $4,662,516 and 21.2%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,108,767, or 23.8%, and 260 basis points, respectively, for the reasons noted above and an unfavorable year-over-year mix.

 

Favorable/Unfavorable Adjustments to Gross Profit

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, circumstances required that we make changes in estimates to various contracts. Such changes in estimates resulted in changes in total gross profit as follows:

 

                                                                   Three months ended

Net adjustments                                      $          (1,172,861) $            (721,005)

                                                                                                  

 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2,713,904 compared to $2,869,058 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $155,154 or 5.4%. The decrease was primarily the result of lower personnel related expenses.

 

Interest expense

 

Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $632,135, compared to $610,896 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $21,239 or 3.5%. The increase was the result of higher year-over-year interest rates charged on our outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the amount of our outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement.

Income Before Provision for Income Taxes

 

Income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $207,710 compared to $1,182,562 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $974,852 or 82.4% for the reasons noted above.

 

Provision for Income Taxes

The decrease in the provision for income tax is primarily the result of the Company’s lower year over year pre-tax book income.

 

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is 19%. The difference between the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the statutory income tax rate of 21% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is primarily due estimated R&D credit, state income taxes and permanent tax differences.

 

Net Income and Earnings per Share

 

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $168,238 compared to $983,305 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $815,067 or 82.9% for the reasons noted above.

 

Basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of $0.01 compared to $0.08 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.07, or 87.5%.

 

Basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was calculated using 12,486,889 and 12,680,584 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, as compared to 12,520,189 and 12,608,189 weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

General

 

At March 31, 2024, we had working capital of $15,166,678 compared to $15,402,381 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $235,703 or 1.5%. The decrease was driven primarily by higher accounts payable, partly offset by higher accounts receivable and lower current portion of long-term debt and loss reserves.

 

Cash Flow

 

A large portion of our cash flow is used to pay for materials and processing costs associated with contracts that are in process and which do not provide for progress payments. Costs and related earnings for which we do not bill on a progress basis, and which, as a result, we bill upon shipment of products, are components of contract assets on our consolidated balance sheets and represent the aggregate costs and related earnings for uncompleted contracts for which the customer has not yet been billed. These costs and earnings are recovered upon shipment of products and presentation of billings in accordance with contract terms.

 

Because ASC 606 requires us to use estimates in determining revenue, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and tax purposes) as reported and actual cash that we receive during any reporting period. Accordingly, it is possible that we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and may need to borrow money or take steps to defer cash outflows until the reported earnings materialize into actual cash receipts.

 

Some of our programs require us to expend up-front costs that may have to be amortized over a portion of production units. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could experience margin degradation, which may be material for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations.

 

We continuously work to improve our payment terms from our customers, including accelerated progress payment arrangements, as well as exploring alternate funding sources.

 

At March 31, 2024, we had cash of $3,018,068 compared to $5,094,794 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2,076,726 or 40.8%. This decrease was primarily the result of repayment of debt and cash flow used in operations.

Bank Credit Facilities

 

On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein and BankUnited N.A. as Sole Arranger, Agent and Collateral Agent (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement” or the “BankUnited Facility”). The Credit Agreement originally provided for a revolving credit loan commitment of $30 million (the “Revolving Loan”) and a $10 million term loan (“Term Loan”). The Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate as defined in the Credit Agreement.

 

On February 20, 2024, the Company entered into a Thirteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Thirteenth Amendment”). Under the Thirteenth Amendment, the parties amended the Credit Agreement by (a) extending the maturity date of the Company’s existing revolving line of credit to August 31, 2025; and (b) setting the aggregate maximum principal amount of all revolving line of credit loans to $19,800,000 from January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, $19,080,000 from April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024, $18,360,000 from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, $17,640,000 from October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, $16,920,000 from January 1, 2025 through March 31, 2025, $16,200,000 from April 1, 2025 through June 30, 2025 and $15,480,000 thereafter, and for payments to be made by the Company to comply therewith (if any such payments are necessary), on the first day of each such period.

 

The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires us to maintain the following financial covenants: (a) minimum debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1.0 for trailing four fiscal quarter periods; (b) maximum leverage ratio of no less than 4.0 to 1.0 for trailing four fiscal quarter periods; (c) minimum net income after taxes as of the end of each fiscal quarter being no less than $1.00; and (d) a minimum adjusted EBITDA at the end of each fiscal quarter of no less than $1.0 million. The additional principal payments, increase in interest and the Amendment Fee provided for in the Eighth Amendment (entered into on October 28, 2021) and Ninth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (entered into on April 12, 2022) are excluded for purposes of calculating compliance with each of the financial covenants.

 

The BankUnited Facility is secured by all of the Company’s assets and the Revolving Loan bears interest at the Prime Rate + 3.50%. The Prime Rate was 8.50% as of March 31, 2024 and as such, the Company’s interest rate on the Revolving Loan was 12.00% as of March 31, 2024.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $19,080,000 and $20,040,000 outstanding under the Revolving Loan, respectively.

 

There is currently no availability for borrowings under the Revolving Loan and the Company finances its operations from internally generated cash flow.

 

Liquidity

 

We believe that our existing resources as of March 31, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. However, our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the timing of new program awards and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing arrangement to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.

 

Contractual Obligations

 

For information concerning our contractual obligations, see Contractual Obligations under Item 7 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Inflation

 

Inflation historically has not had a material effect on our operations, although the current inflationary environment in the U.S., and its impact on interest rates, the supply chain, the labor market and general economic conditions, are factors that the Company actively monitors in an attempt to mitigate and manage potential negative impacts on and risks faced by the Company. The majority of the Company’s long term contracts with its customers reflect fixed pricing and its long term contracts with its suppliers reflect fixed pricing. When bidding for work, the Company takes inflation risk and supply side pricing risk into account in its proposals.

Item 4 – Controls and Procedures 

 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:

 

     ●    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

           dispositions of our

           assets;

 

     ●    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

           accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of

           our management and directors;

           and

 

     ●    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our

           assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial

           statements.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In connection with this evaluation, management identified a deficiency that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, pertaining to income tax accounting. For more information on this deficiency, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 due to the aforementioned material weakness pertaining to income tax accounting.

 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 

The Company has begun to develop new controls designed to remediate the aforementioned 2023 material weakness pertaining to income tax accounting, which the Company intends to implement during 2024.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
