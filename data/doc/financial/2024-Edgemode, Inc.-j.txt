Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 – Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Edgemode, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Edgemode” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as amended, as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2023, as reported in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of the Company, have been omitted.

 

NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. It is reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term.

 

Principals of consolidation

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edgemode, Inc., the accounts of its 100% owned subsidiaries, EdgeMode and Edgemode Mine Co UK Limited. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

 

Fair Value Measurements

 

Generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price) and such principles also establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value using the following definitions (from highest to lowest priority):

 

     ·    Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted

           assets or liabilities.

           

           

     ·    Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,

           either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices

           for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can

           be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other

           means.

           

     ·    Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and

           unobservable.

 

 

 

                                                                   7                                                                    

 

 

The following fair value hierarchy tables present information about the Company’s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The Company had no assets valued using level 1, level 2, or level 3 inputs as of March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

Derivatives are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses a binomial calculator model. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.

 

The Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provides that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five days following settlement. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.

 

 

 

                                                                   8                                                                    

 

 

Providing computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.

 

Fair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt. There is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results from operations.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718) and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 2018-07 (ASC 2018-07). All transactions in which the consideration provided in exchange for the purchase of goods or services consists of the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete or the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached because of sufficiently large disincentives for nonperformance.

 

The Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees” (“Topic No. 505-50”). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

 

Long-Lived Assets – Cryptocurrencies

 

We account for our cryptocurrencies, intangible assets and long-term license agreement in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 350-30, General Intangibles Other Than Goodwill, and ASC Subtopic 360-10-05, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC Subtopic 350-30 requires assets to be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. Our cryptocurrencies are deemed to have an indefinite useful life; therefore amounts are not amortized, but rather are assessed for impairment as further discussed in our impairment policy. Under ASC Subtopic 350-30 any intangible asset with a useful life is required to be amortized over that life and the useful life is to be evaluated every reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Costs of internally developing, maintaining, or restoring intangible assets are recognized as an expense when incurred.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”). This ASU is intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those crypto assets at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity’s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period. ASU 2023-08 requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earning as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity adopts the amendment and is effective for all reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.

 

NOTE 3 – Going Concern

 

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At March 31, 2024, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations and expects to incur further losses as it has suspended its operations until such time, if any, that the Company receives adequate funding, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s management has also begun exploring possible opportunities for the Company involving mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions in an effort to diversify our business. The Company is not currently a party to any agreement or understandings with any third parties, and there are no assurances even if the Company’s management locates an opportunity which it believes will be in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders that it will ever consummate such a transaction. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these efforts. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern.

 

NOTE 4 – Related Party Transactions

 

As of March 31, 2024 the Company owed the executive officers of the Company $961,701 in accrued payroll for services performed.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the executive officers of the Company advanced $16,000 to the Company for working capital needs. The advances are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.

As of March 31, 2024, the balance on the note is $94,439, with a remaining unamortized discount of $0.

 

On August 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC, an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company sold the investor an unsecured original issuance discount promissory note in the principal amount of $71,450 (the “August Promissory Note”). The Company received net proceeds of $60,000 in consideration of issuance of the August Promissory Note after original issue discount of $7,200 and legal fees of $4,250.

As a result of the default, the 1800 Notes became convertible into common stock and an additional $88,618 of principal was added to the note balance. In addition, as a result of the default the notes became convertible at a variable rate resulting in derivative liability accounting under ASC 815. The fair value of the derivative on the date of default was charged directly to interest expense, as the notes are passed due. See further discussion under Note 7.

NOTE 7 – Derivative Liabilities

 

The fair values of the conversion option of outstanding convertible notes payable and common stock warrants were determined to be derivative liabilities under ASC 815 due to the default on convertible notes payable disclosed above, which resulted in a variable conversion price on the outstanding convertible note payable. The fair value of the derivative liabilities was estimated using a binomial model with the following assumptions:

NOTE 9 – Commitments and Contingencies

 

Legal Contingencies

 

On February 8, 2022, the Company was notified of a potential lawsuit related to the termination of our Advisory Panel Membership agreement with Taylor Black Wealth, Ltd. (“Taylor”). The Company engaged Taylor for assistance with capital raises and was to be partially compensated with stock options, subject to vesting. Taylor claims that the Company terminated the agreement unlawfully and therefore are still entitled to the remaining unvested options which the Company believes to be cancelled. The total number of stock options being contested is 137,473. No additional communication has been received related to the claims from Taylor.

ITEM 2.              MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion and analysis compares our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (the “2024 Quarter”) with those for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the “2023 Quarter”).

 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This report contains “forward-looking statements”. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding expanding our business and our liquidity as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, our ability to raise capital to buy crypto mining machines we have commitments to purchase, regulatory issues which affect our business model, and those discussed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 

Business Overview

 

Since our incorporation, the Company has attempted to become involved in a number of business ventures, all of which, excluding Edgemode Wyoming, were unsuccessful and which have been abandoned. Edgemode Wyoming historically mined Ethereum from late 2020 until September 2022. Although Edgemode Wyoming historically mined Ethereum, due to the change of Ethereum (ETH) from Proof of Work (POW) to Proof of stake (POS), the Company terminated all rental agreements and future purchase orders related to Ethereum mining operations. We now intend to mine Bitcoin, subject to financing. However, we require significant financing to commence Bitcoin mining. Since late 2022 we have focused on securing a debt facility. We cannot provide any assurances we will receive any capital under a debt facility. Any debt financing will be used to finance the purchase of Bitcoin mining hardware and hosting contracts. We have suspended our daily operations subject to receiving additional funding. There are no assurances we will receive adequate financing. Our management has also begun exploring possible opportunities for the Company involving mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions in an effort to diversify our business. We are not currently a party to any agreement or understandings with any third parties, and there are no assurances even if our management locates an opportunity which it believes will be in the best interests of our shareholders that we will ever consummate such a transaction. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these efforts.

 

As stated above, at present, the Company has no sources of revenue and has no specific business plan or purpose without significant financing. Therefore, the Company’s business plan is to also seek an acquisition or merger candidate (a “Business Combination”). As a result, the Company is considered a “blank check” or “shell” company. See the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Company’s securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan and/or closed on a suitable Business Combination. 

 

Although we have been in discussions with potential partners or targets, we have not entered into any definitive agreements. The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process, and we have not yet identified a target operating business for acquisition. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders may be scarce, or we may be unable to attract the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, including due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities for the Company.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

We discuss the material accounting policies that are critical in making the estimates and judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”. There has been no material change in critical accounting policies or estimates during the period covered by this report.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023

 

Results of operations

 

Our operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (the “2024 Quarter”) was $336,599 compared to $1,705,525, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the “2023 Quarter”), a decrease of 80%. In the 2024 Quarter, the Company incurred stock-based compensation expense of $0 compared to $1,236,487 for the 2023 Quarter. The stock-based compensation for the 2023 Quarter was related to the amendment of options to the officers of the Company.

 

Our other expense for the 2024 Quarter was $114,605 compared to other expense of $72,486 for the 2023 Quarter. Other expense in the 2024 quarter was comprised of $24,420 in interest expense and $90,185 for the loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Other expense for the 2023 quarter was comprised of $7,274 in interest expense, $51,859 in a prepayment penalty on the redemption of our Series B Preferred shares, $9,975 from a loss on settlement and $3,378 in other expenses.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024 and May 21, 2024, the Company had approximately $0 of cash on hand. Our liquidity was primarily derived from debt and equity investments from accredited investors and also from selling the crypto that we mined through September 2022. To recommence our crypto operations and fund operations for the next 12 months, the Company is seeking to raise $75 million in debt facility. We currently have no available sources of capital and we can provide no assurances that any debt financings will be available in the future. Additionally, the Company is (i) in default under the 1800 Notes in the sum of 150% of the remaining outstanding principal balances of the 1800 Notes in the aggregate of approximately $235,000, plus accrued interest and default interest as defined under such notes, (ii) in default under two other notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $120,000 and (iii) owes a significant amount of money to its executive officers.

 

We have suspended our operations. If we fail to close on a debt facility or raise sufficient additional funds from other sources, we will be required to abandon our plan of operations.

 

The Company has terminated the agreements for approximately $1.6 million of debt for equipment that the Company was using for mining and returned the equipment to the vendor to settle the outstanding liabilities. The Company is making no further payments against the potential balance. No confirmation has been received from 2CRSI and as such the balance remains outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet in the accompanying financial statements.

During the 2024 Quarter and the 2023 Quarter, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:

During the 2023 Quarter, cash provided by operating activities of $281,586 primarily resulted from the refund of prepaid hosting services, offset by the net loss of $1,788,011 and stock-based compensation of $1,236,487.

ITEM 3.              QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not applicable.

 

 

 

                                                                   18                                                                   

 

 

ITEM 4.              CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We are required to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting result from limited segregation of duties and limited multiple levels of review in the financial close process, along with a lack of well-established policies and procedures to identify, approve, and report related party transactions. 

 

We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. We do not, however, expect that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls will be remediated until such time as we have added additional personnel, including additional accounting and administrative staff, allowing improved internal control over financial reporting.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1.              LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

From time to time, the Company may become a party to legal actions or proceedings in the ordinary course of its business.

ITEM 1A.             RISK FACTORS

 

While we attempt to identify, manage, and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Our “Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, which we strongly encourage you to review.
