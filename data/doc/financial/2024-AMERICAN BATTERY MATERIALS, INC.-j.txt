AMERICAN BATTERY MATERIALS, INC.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

(Unaudited)

 

Note 1 - Nature of the Business

 

American Battery Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is a US based renewable energy company focused on the extraction, refinement and distribution of technical minerals in an environmentally responsible manner.

 

The Company formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations, while focusing on implementing a new operational direction.

 

Through the corporate reorganization and repositioning process, the Company found itself with the unique opportunity to expand its management team and acquire mining claims that historically reported high levels of Lithium and other tech minerals. The Company hired and affiliated itself with industry veterans that bring decades of experience, credibility and relationships.

 

On November 5, 2021, the Company acquired the rights to 102 Federal Mining Claims located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah for $100,000. The acquisition was driven by historical mineral data from seven (7) existing wells with brine aquifer access. The independent third-party Technical Report indicated that further investment and development in the claims were warranted.

 

On April 25, 2023, the Company formed Mountain Sage Minerals, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, of which it is the 100% owner. The Company will look to expand its holdings in the Lisbon Valley area with the acquisition of additional mineral claims and joint venture opportunities through this new LLC.

 

On May 1, 2023, FINRA completed the processing of our application for a name change, and our name was officially changed to American Battery Materials, Inc. At the same time, the Company’s trading symbol was changed to BLTH. These changes better reflect the business of the Company.

 

On June 1, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Seaport Global Acquisition II Corp., a Delaware corporation (“SGII”), and Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of SGII (“Merger Sub”). SGII is a blank check company, also referred to as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. Following material changes to the transaction proposed by SGII making the transaction untenable to us, on November 20, 2023, SGII notified us that it had elected to terminate the Merger Agreement.

 

On August 4, 2023, the Company filed an Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) in order to effect a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1-for-300 (the “Reverse Split”). The Company and its shareholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote previously approved a reverse stock split for not less than 1-for-10 and not more than 1-for-1,000, at any time prior to October 20, 2023, with the Company’s Board having the discretion to determine whether or not the Reverse Split is to be effected, and if effected, the exact ratio for the Reverse Split within the above range. On August 1, 2023, the Company’s unanimously approved the Reverse Split and authorized the filing of the Amendment. On December 8, 2023, the company effectuated the reverse split of the common stock by a ratio of one-for-300 (the “Reverse Split”). All per share amounts and number of shares in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split.

 

The Company has been moving forward with its strategy of employing advanced brine extractive technology methodologies and has been in talks with numerous extraction providers. Selective mineral extraction is clearly the most cost-effective and ESG friendly approach currently available. Technologies are being utilized that can extract the desired minerals and metals from the brine and then re-inject the brines back down into the aquifer. The prospective partners have been provided the analytical results from the technical reports, but will soon provide current results, analytical, geotech modeling, aquifer modeling, recharge, flows and depth.

 

                                                                   5

 

 

Note 2 - Going Concern

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company had net loss of $863,883 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, has accumulated losses totaling $21,103,522, and has a working capital deficit of $4,079,828 as of March 31, 2024. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

 

Until the Company can generate significant cash from operations, its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. The Company hopes to raise additional financing, potentially through the sale of debt or equity instruments, or a combination, to fund its operations for the next 12 months and allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. These conditions have raised substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements, which has not been alleviated.

 

Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and be based on events different from those assumptions. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; estimating, therefore, requires the exercise of judgment. Thus, accounting estimates change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, or as additional information is obtained.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. Equipment has estimated useful lives between three and seven years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.

 

Mineral Rights and Properties

 

The Company capitalizes acquisition costs until the Company determines the economic viability of the property. Since the Company does not have proven and probable reserves as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-K Item 1300, exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses mineral lease costs and repair and maintenance costs as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of our properties for impairment, including mineral rights, upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During the period ending December 31, 2023, the Company took action to expand on its rights to 102 federal mining claims located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah that it purchased on November 5, 2021, for $100,000. The Company acquired and staked additional lithium mining claims adjacent to its Lisbon Valley Project in Utah for $106,000. The new claims have been registered with the Bureau of Land Management. The Company now owns a total of 743 placer claims over 14,260 acres, comprised of (i) the 102 original claims held; and (ii) the 641 new claims. No impairment or capitalizable costs related to the mineral claims were noted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

 

                                                                   6

 

 

Earnings Per Share

 

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per share reflect the actual weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed including the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares had been issued. In a loss period, the calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share is considered to be the same, as the impact of potential common shares is anti-dilutive.

 

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were approximately 290,000 shares potentially issuable under convertible debt agreements, options, warrants and preferred stock that could dilute basic earnings per share if converted that were excluded from the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net losses.

   

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants issued by the Company contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

 

     ●    Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted

           assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities

           occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing

           basis.

 

     ●    Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for

           substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that the Company

           values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the

           term of the derivative instruments, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which

           transactions are executed in the

           marketplace.

 

     ●    Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value

           measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). Level 3

           instruments include derivative warrant instruments. The Company does not have sufficient corroborating evidence to support

           classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 1 or Level

           2.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and non-employees to be measured at grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued and recognized as expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally equivalent to the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The measurement date for the non-forfeitable awards to non-employees that vest immediately is the date the award is issued.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

We recognize revenue under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control for promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue recognition principles, an entity is required to identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied (i.e., either over time or at a point in time). ASC 606 further requires that companies disclose sufficient information to enable readers of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

 

                                                                   7

 

 

The Company recognized $0 revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

On August 5, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. This ASU is effective for public business entities, excluding smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and for all other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted for all entities no earlier than for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the effects this ASU will have on its financial statements.

 

The Company has examined all other recent accounting pronouncements and determined that they will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 

Note 4 - Debt

 

Promissory Notes Payable

 

In 2014 and 2016, the Company issued two promissory notes in the total principal amount of $70,000; a $40,000 Note issued Dec 19, 2014; and, a $30,000 Note issued on March 29, 2016. Each note had a one-year maturity date; was governed by California law; bears interest at 10% per annum; and, requires notice from the holder in order for the respective Note to be in default. The holder of each Note has failed to provide a notice of default under either Note. Further, enforceability of each Note is uncertain as California law has a 6-year statute of limitations (commences on the maturity date) to initiate a collection action on a note. At December 31, 2023, neither of the Notes was in default and the balance outstanding was $70,000.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued two additional unsecured promissory notes and borrowed an aggregate amount of $80,000. $30,000 is represented by a note issued on Sept 23, 2016. This note had a one-year maturity date; was governed by California law; bears interest at 10% per annum; and, requires notice from the holder in order to be in default. The holder of this Note has failed to provide a notice of default. Further, enforceability of this Note is uncertain as California law has a 6-year statute of limitations (commences on the maturity date) to initiate a collection action on a note. At December 31, 2023, this Note was not in default and the balance outstanding was $30,000. $50,000 is represented by a note issued on Nov 20, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2022, total principal and accrued interest in the amount of $50,000 of principal and $27,972 of interest were converted into a $95,088 convertible note dated September 23, 2022. The replacement note was converted in shares of our common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the original $50,000 note was no longer issued and outstanding.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 the note was extended to June 30, 2024, increasing principal to $225,000. Accrued interest as of March 31, 2024 was $4,743.

 

Convertible Notes Payable and Convertible Notes Payable – Related Party

 

In February 2023, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note agreement in the amount of $25,000 with a related party. The note has a 1 year term, bears interest of 9% and has a conversion price equal to the lesser of (1) the most recent issuance price; or, (2) closing price for the common stock on the maturity date. The outstanding principal balance was $25,000 as of December 31, 2023. Accrued interest as of December 31, 2023 was $1,881. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, total principal in the amount of $25,000 and accrued interest in the amount of $2,574 were forgiven by noteholder. The noteholder was issued new convertible note in exchange.

 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements with seven investors not affiliated with the Company (the “Purchasers”) pursuant to which the Purchasers purchased from the Company convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000. A total of 20,171,633 shares of common stock were issued according to the note agreements or as additional consideration for the issuance of the notes. The outstanding principal and accrued interest balances at December 31, 2023 were $2,000,000 and $95,396, respectively. 

 

The Convertible Notes provide for a maturity of 12-months; 7.5% interest per annum; and, no right to prepay during the first 6-months after the date of issuance (the “Issuance Date”). The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company (the “Conversion Shares”) as follows:

 

(a) The Convertible Notes automatically convert into Conversion Shares upon the shares of the Company’s common stock being listed on a higher exchange due to the (i) pricing and funding of an S-1 registration statement; or, (ii) the closing of a transaction resulting in the uplist (either, a “Triggering Transaction”). The conversion price for the Conversion Shares in an automatic conversion shall be equal to:

 

(1) 75% of the price under the Triggering Transaction if within 120-days of the Issuance Date;

 

(2) 70% of the price under the Triggering Transaction if within 121 to 150-days of the Issuance Date;

 

(3) 65% of the price under the Triggering Transaction if more than 150-days of the Issuance Date. 

 

(b) The Purchasers have the right to convert into Conversion Shares, in whole or in part, at any time after 180-days following the Issuance Date. The conversion price for the Conversion Shares in a voluntary conversion shall be equal to 65% of the volume weighted average price for the Company’s common stock during the 20-consecutive trading days preceding the conversion.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, notes with six investors not affiliated with the Company were amended with increase in principal from $1,800,000 to $2,469,229, increase of intertest rate from 7.5% to 10% and extended until September 30, 2024. A total of 234,000 shares of common stock were issued according to the note agreements or as additional consideration for the note amendment. As of March 31, 2024 total principal and accrued interest on these seven notes totaled $2,669,229 and $9,872, respectively.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into seven convertible promissory note agreements in the aggregate amount of $631,511, of which $422,787 with the related parties. The Convertible Notes provide for a maturity of 10 and 12-months; 7.5% and 8% interest per annum. Accrued interest as of March 31, 2024 was $1,806.

The Company filed a certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation, which effectuated as of December 8, 2023, a reverse split of the Company’s common stock by a ratio of one-for-300 (the “Reverse Split”). All per share amounts and number of shares in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split.

 

On October 20, 2022 the Company, following receipt of written approval from stockholders acting without a meeting and holding at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting, filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to “American Battery Materials, Inc.” (the “Name Change”); and (ii) increase the total number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 600,000,000 to 4,500,000,000 (the “Authorized Share Increase”).

On October 20, 2022, in addition to the Name Change and the Authorized Share Increase, the holder of 63.86% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote took action by written consent and without a meeting, pursuant to Delaware General Corporate Law Section 228 and adopted and approved the following actions:

 

     1.   Future amendment of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to implement a decrease in the authorized shares of the

           Company’s Common Stock from 4,500,000,000 to a number of not less than 10,000,000 and not more than 2,000,000,000 (the

           “Authorized Share Reduction”), at any time prior to October 20, 2023 (the “Anniversary Date”), with the Board having the

           discretion to determine whether or not the Authorized Share Reduction is to be effected, and if effected, the exact number

           of the Authorized Share Reduction within the above

           range.

 

     2.   Future amendment of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common

           Stock by a ratio of not less than 1-for-10 and not more than 1-for-1,000, (the “Reverse Split”), at any time prior to the

           Anniversary Date, with the Board having the discretion to determine whether or not the Reverse Split is to be effected and

           if effected, the exact ratio for the Reverse Split within the above

           range.

Overview and Outlook

 

We are a U.S. based renewable energy company focused on the extraction, refinement and distribution of technical minerals in an environmentally responsible manner. We formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations and focusing on implementing a new operational direction.

 

Through the corporate reorganization and repositioning process, we found ourselves with the unique opportunity to acquire mining claims that historically reported high levels of lithium and other technical minerals crucial to produce batteries used in many technology products and markets. We hired and affiliated ourselves with industry veterans that bring decades of experience, credibility and relationships.

 

                                                                   12

 

 

On November 5, 2021, we acquired the rights to 102 federal mining claims located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah for $100,000 plus the future payment of royalties based on a percentage of the net revenue from the sale of lithium produced from a portion of the mining property. The acquisition was driven by historical mineral data from seven existing wells with brine aquifer access. We are defined as an exploration stage issuer, under SEC Regulation S-K Item 1300. An independent third-party technical report indicated that further investment and development in the claims was warranted, although no determination has been made whether we have any reserves of minerals. Similarly, no determination has been made whether mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted. We have no mineral reserves as defined by Regulation S-K Item 1300 and have had no mining revenue to date.

 

In July 2023, we acquired and staked additional lithium mining claims adjacent to our Lisbon Valley Project in Utah. The new claims have been registered with the BLM. We now own a total of 743 placer claims over 14,320 acres (approximately 22 square miles), comprised of the 102 original mining claims and 641 new claims.

 

On April 25, 2023, we formed Mountain Sage Minerals, LLC, a Utah limited liability company. We plan to expand our holdings in the Lisbon Valley area with the acquisition of additional mineral claims and joint venture opportunities through this entity.

 

On June 1, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Seaport Global Acquisition II Corp. (“SGII”) and Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGII. SGII is a blank check company, also referred to as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result of the Merger Agreement, we would have become a wholly owned subsidiary of SGII. Following material changes to the transaction proposed by SGII making the transaction untenable to us, on November 20, 2023, SGII notified us that it had elected to terminate the Merger Agreement.

 

We have been moving forward with our strategy of employing advanced brine extractive technology methodologies and have been in talks with numerous extraction providers. Selective mineral extraction is the most cost-effective and ESG friendly approach currently available. Technologies are being utilized that can extract the desired minerals and metals from the brine and then re-inject the brines back down into the aquifer. The prospective partners have been provided the analytical results from the technical reports, but will soon provide current results, analytical, geotech modeling, aquifer modeling, recharge, flows and depth. We will need funding to support continuing operations and support our growth strategy and we will need to finance operations by offering any combination of equity offerings, debt financing, collaborations, strategic alliances or other licensing arrangements. There is no assurance we will be able to raise sufficient capital to finance our operations.

 

Results of Operations

 

Three months ended March 31, 2024, Compared to Three months ended March 31, 2023

 

Revenue

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, our company had no revenue.

 

Operating Expenses

 

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $264,035, a decrease of $182,411 or 41%, compared to $446,476 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in professional fees.

 

                                                                   13

 

 

In addition, we initiated construction strategies based on reports from RESPEC Company LLC, the Company’s geotech, engineering and resource management partner, for geological modeling and drill entry design and related planning.

 

Gain (Loss) on Settlement of Liabilities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our company recorded a loss on settlement of liabilities of $516,083. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, our company recorded a gain on settlement of liabilities of $67,984, consisting of $7,008 in principal and $60,976 in interest forgiven by creditors.

 

Fair Value of Stock Issued for Note Modification

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our company recorded a fair value of stock issued for note modification of $5,382. No such transactions were noted during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Interest Expense

 

Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $78,383, as compared to $10,154 during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Net Loss

 

As a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $863,883 as compared to the net loss of $388,646 during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Our company had a net loss of $863,883 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, had accumulated losses totaling $21,103,522, and a working capital deficit of $4,079,828 as of March 31, 2024. These factors, among others, indicate that our company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

 

Since we acquired our first mining claims in November 2021, we have faced an increasingly challenging liquidity situation that has limited our ability to execute our operating plan. Our company will need to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations for the next 12 months and to allow us to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, we will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that our company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing.

 

Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Unless we can attract additional investment, our operating as a going concern is in doubt.

 

If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future obligations, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock.

 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our company used $85,886 of cash in operating activities as a result of our net loss of $863,883, offset by loss on debt settlement of $516,083 and amortization of debt discount of $20,235, fair value of stock issued for note modification of $5,382, share-based compensation of $1,566, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $110,814.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, our company used $317,613 of cash in operating activities as a result of our net loss of $388,646, increased by gain on debt settlement of $67,984 and offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $139,017.

Amendments to Outstanding Promissory Notes 

 

On various dates from April 1 to April 8, 2024, with an effective date as of March 29, 2024, we entered into the following transactions regarding our outstanding promissory notes:

 

          ●    Pursuant to a Convertible Note Amendment Agreement with each of five investors holding convertible notes in the

                aggregate principal amount of $1,750,000 with accrued interest of $125,646, each of these investors agreed to (a)

                extend the maturity date of their note to the earlier of (i) September 30, 2024 or (ii) the closing of an “uplisting”

                transaction in which our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation on their

                conversions so that the investor will not effect a conversion under its note until the earlier of (i) the uplisting

                transaction closing or (ii) July 1,

                2024.

 

          ●    Pursuant to a Convertible Note Amendment Agreement with one investor holding a convertible note in the principal amount

                of $50,000 with accrued interest of $3,583, the investor agreed to: (a) extend the maturity date of its note to the

                earlier of (i) March 31, 2025 or (ii) the closing of an uplisting transaction in which our common stock is traded on a

                national securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation on its conversions so that the investor will not effect a

                conversion under its note until the earlier of (i) the uplisting transaction closing or (ii) the maturity

                date.

 

          ●    Pursuant to a Promissory Note Amendment Agreement with one investor holding a promissory note in the principal amount

                of $25,000 with accrued interest of $2,971, the investor agreed to: (a) extend the maturity date of its note to the

                earlier of (i) March 31, 2025 or (ii) the closing of an uplisting transaction in which our common stock is traded on a

                national securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation on conversions so that the investor will not effect a

                conversion under its note until the earlier of (i) the uplisting transaction closing or (ii) the maturity

                date.

 

In consideration for the extensions of the maturity date and agreement not to convert their notes, the principal amount due under each note was increased by 30% and the interest rate of each note was increased to 10% beginning on the effective date of March 29, 2024. We negotiated the note amendments with the investors, all of whom are unaffiliated with our company, on an arm’s-length basis. As additional consideration for each note amendment, we also issued to the investors a total of 237,250 shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to our short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by us. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

 

          ●    Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,

                unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or

                liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing

                basis.

 

          ●    Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly,

                for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that we

                value using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the

                term of the derivative instruments, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which

                transactions are executed in the

                marketplace.

 

          ●    Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value

                measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market

                activity).

 

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Certain warrants issued by us contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

 

Not required for smaller reporting companies.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

David Graber, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Sebastian Lux, who serves as our President and Chief Operating Officer and Agustin Cabo, who serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer (collectively referred to herein as “Senior Management”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Senior Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on its evaluation, Senior Management concluded as of March 31, 2024 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:

 

     ●    We do not have controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of

           accounting transactions. Accordingly, we believe we have a material weakness because there is a reasonable possibility that

           a material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a

           timely

           basis.

 

     ●    We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal

           controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which is applicable to

           us. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on

           our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted

           represents a material

           weakness.

 

     ●    We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our

           size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.

           However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions

           should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on

           our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted

           represents a material

           weakness.

 

     ●    We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting.

 

     ●    We do not have a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of

           required internal controls and

           procedures.

 

Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, Senior Management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, Senior Management is currently seeking to improve our controls and procedures in an effort to remediate the deficiencies described above.

 

                                                                   15
