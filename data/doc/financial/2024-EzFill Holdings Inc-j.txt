EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

 

Liquidity and Going Concern

 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had:

 

●         Net loss of $1,899,122; and

●         Net cash used in operations was $1,140,148

 

Additionally, at March 31, 2024, the Company had:

 

●         Accumulated deficit of $47,216,172

●         Stockholders’ deficit of $3,312,101; and

●         Working capital deficit of $6,343,174

 

The Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital immediately in order to continue to fund its operations. The Company has relied on related parties for the debt based funding of its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations.

 

The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company’s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings.

 

There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which are favorable, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay, reduce, or cease its operations.

 

We manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand of $48,613 at March 31, 2024.

 

The Company has historically incurred significant losses since inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues from the sales of its products and services to achieve profitable operations. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ended March 31, 2025, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.

 

                                                                  F-8

These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent to the date that these financial statements are issued.

 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

 

Management’s strategic plans include the following:

 

●         Expand into new and existing markets (commercial and residential),

●         Obtain additional debt and/or equity based financing,

●         Collaborations with other operating businesses for strategic opportunities; and

●         Acquire other businesses to enhance or complement our current business model while accelerating our growth.

 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

 

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions

 

The Company accounts for acquisitions that qualify as business combinations by applying the acquisition method according to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”).

 

Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred.

 

The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of the fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions.

 

                                                                  F-9

Purchase price allocations may be preliminary, and, during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, changes in assumptions and estimates that result in adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded in the period the adjustments are determined.

 

Significant judgments are used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as intangibles. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Company’s current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates which may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within the Company’s earnings.

 

The Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and processes that can create outputs that would meet the definition of a business. When applying the screen test, significant judgment is required to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.

 

Accounting for asset acquisitions falls under the guidance of Topic 805, Business Combinations, specifically Subtopic 805-50. A cost accumulation model is used to determine an asset acquisition’s cost. Assets acquired are based on their cost, generally allocated to them on a relative fair value basis. Direct acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets.

 

The distinction between business combinations and asset acquisitions involves judgment, particularly when applying the screen test to determine the nature of the transaction. Incorrect judgments or changes in decisions in these areas could materially affect the determination of goodwill, the recognition and measurement of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and, consequently, our financial position and results of operations.

 

                                                                  F-10

Business Segments and Concentrations

 

The Company uses the “management approach” to identify its reportable segments. The management approach requires companies to report segment financial information consistent with information used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the basis for identifying the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business as one reportable segment.

 

Customers in the United States accounted for 100% of our revenues. We do not have any property or equipment outside of the United States.

 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

 

Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.

 

Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which include both quantitative and qualitative assessments that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

 

Significant estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include, allowance for doubtful accounts and other receivables, inventory reserves and classifications, valuation of loss contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation, estimated useful lives related to property and equipment, impairment of intangible assets, implicit interest rate in right-of-use operating leases, uncertain tax positions, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

 

Risks and Uncertainties

 

The Company operates in an industry that is subject to intense competition and changes in consumer demand. The Company’s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business failure.

 

The Company has experienced, and in the future may experience, variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among others, (i) the cyclical nature of the industry, (ii) general economic conditions in the various local markets in which the Company competes, including a potential general downturn in the economy, and (iii) the volatility of prices in connection with the Company’s distribution of the product. These factors, among others, make it difficult to project the Company’s operating results on a consistent basis.

 

                                                                  F-11

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company’s principal or, in absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability.

 

The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value.

 

The three tiers are defined as follows:

 

          ●              Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or

                          liabilities in active

                          markets;

          ●              Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or

                          indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities;

                          and

          ●              Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to

                          develop its own

                          assumptions.

 

The determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement’s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management’s assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. Although the Company believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.

 

                                                                  F-12

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

 

The Company’s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and accounts payable and accrued expenses – related party, are carried at historical cost. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

 

ASC 825-10 “Financial Instruments” allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (“fair value option”). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding financial instruments.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Concentration of Credit Risk

 

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

 

The Company is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent account balances exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is $250,000.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company did not experience any losses on cash balances in excess of FDIC insured limits.

 

Investments

 

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses (that are deemed to be temporary) reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

 

Realized gains and losses and charges for other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net income, with related purchase costs based on the first-in, first-out method.

 

Premiums or discounts on debt are amortized straight line over the term.

 

                                                                  F-13



                                                                                                                                        

 

EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

MARCH 31, 2024

 

The Company evaluates its available-for-sale-investments for possible other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing factors such as the extent to which, and length of time, an investment’s fair value has been below the Company’s cost basis, the issuer’s financial condition, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for sufficient time for its market value to recover. For impairments that are other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the investment’s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value of the investment then becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment, and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company received proceeds of $0 and $1,150,928, respectively, in connection with the sale and liquidation of its investment portfolio.

 

Realized losses, including amortization of bond premiums on these debt securities were $0 and $21,737 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding customer balances. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable. The Company does not require collateral.

 

Management periodically assesses the Company’s accounts receivable and, if necessary, establishes an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information and existing economic conditions. Accounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to operations when that determination is made.

 

The following is a summary of the Company’s accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Impairment of Long-lived Assets including Internal Use Capitalized Software Costs

 

Management evaluates the recoverability of the Company’s identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35-15 “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Events and circumstances considered by the Company in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and changes in the Company’s business strategy. In determining if impairment exists, the Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.

 

If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets’ carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

 

There were no impairment losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

See note 3 for discussion of impairments of long lived assets.

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 

Expenditures for repair and maintenance which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment are charged to operations. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected in operations.

 

                                                                  F-16

Management reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

 

There were no impairment losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

See note 3 for discussion of impairments of long lived assets.

 

Derivative Liabilities

 

The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic No. 480, (“ASC 480”), “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and FASB ASC Topic No. 815, (“ASC 815”) “Derivatives and Hedging”. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period, with any increase or decrease in the fair value recorded in the results of operations (other income/expense) as a gain or loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The Company uses a binomial pricing model to determine fair value of these instruments.

 

Upon conversion or repayment of a debt instrument in exchange for shares of common stock, where the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability (generally convertible debt and warrants), the Company records the shares of common stock at fair value, relieves all related debt, derivative liabilities, and any remaining unamortized debt discounts, and where appropriate recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment (debt based derivative liabilities). In connection with any extinguishments of equity based derivative liabilities (typically warrants), the Company records an increase to additional paid-in capital for any remaining liability balance extinguished.

 

Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had no derivative liabilities.

 

Original Issue Discounts and Other Debt Discounts

 

For certain notes issued, the Company may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount. The original issue discount is recorded as a debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note, and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 

                                                                  F-17

Additionally, the Company may issue common stock with certain notes issued, which are recorded at fair value. These discounts are also recorded as a component of debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note, and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined debt discounts cannot exceed the face amount of the debt issued.

 

Debt Issue Cost

 

Debt issuance cost paid to lenders, or third parties are recorded as debt discounts and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 

Right of Use Assets and Lease Obligations

 

The Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability reflect the present value of the Company’s estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which may include options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate.

 

Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the performance of the business remains strong. Therefore, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability may include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company. The Company’s operating leases contained renewal options that expire at various dates with no residual value guarantees. Future obligations relating to the exercise of renewal options is included in the measurement if, based on the judgment of management, the renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised. Factors in determining whether an option is reasonably certain of exercise include, but are not limited to, the value of leasehold improvements, the value of the renewal rate compared to market rates, and the presence of factors that would cause a significant economic penalty to the Company if the option is not exercised. Management reasonably plans to exercise all options, and as such, all renewal options are included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.

 

As the rate implicit in leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. See Note 7 for third party and related party operating leases.

 

                                                                  F-18

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company generates its revenue from mobile fuel sales, either as a one-time purchase, or through a monthly membership. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and includes a delivery fee for each delivery or a subscription fee on a monthly basis for memberships.

 

Under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any sales incentives, discounts, rebates, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The Company’s contracts with its customers do not include multiple performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.

 

The following represents the analysis management has considered in determining its revenue recognition policy:

 

Identify the contract with a customer

 

A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.

 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

 

                                                                  F-19



                                                                                                                                        

 

EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Determine the transaction price

 

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.

 

None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component.

 

Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract

 

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract with variable consideration, the Company must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. For example, a bonus or penalty may be associated with one or more, but not all, distinct services promised in a series of distinct services that forms part of a single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.

 

If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.

 

The Company’s contracts have a distinct single performance obligation and there are no contracts with variable consideration.

 

Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

 

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service to a customer.

 

                                                                  F-20

The following reflects additional discussion regarding our revenue recognition policies for each of our material revenue streams. For each revenue stream we do not offer any returns, refunds or warranties, and no arrangements are cancellable. Additionally, all contract consideration is fixed and determinable at the initiation of the contract.

 

Currently, the Company only has two separate and distinct single performance obligations in its contractual arrangements.

 

First, the Company generally recognizes membership revenues at the end of each month after services have been rendered. There are no prepaid membership revenues.

 

Second, the Company recognizes fuel sales each month after delivery has occurred.

 

Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)

 

Contract liabilities represent deposits made by customers before the satisfaction of performance obligation and recognition of revenue. Upon completion of the performance obligation(s) that the Company has with the customer based on the terms of the contract, the liability for the customer deposit is relieved and revenue is recognized.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred revenue of $0, respectively.

 

The following represents the Company’s disaggregation of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

The Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

The Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

 

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. No interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions were recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets

 

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.

 

The Company reviews the likelihood that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.

 

Certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. The Company looks to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date, recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses.

 

                                                                  F-22

Other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:

 

       ●    Earnings history;

       ●    Projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;

       ●    The duration of statutory carry forward periods;

       ●    Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary

             difference;

       ●    Nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and

       ●    The sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.

 

Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of its cumulative results in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in a net carrying amount of $0.

 

Advertising Costs

 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

The Company recognized $24,506 and $58,640 in marketing and advertising costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” using the fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.

 

                                                                  F-23

The Company uses the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and uses the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options.

 

The fair value of stock-based compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.

 

When determining fair value of stock options, the Company considers the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes model:

 

●         Exercise price,

●         Expected dividends,

●         Expected volatility,

●         Risk-free interest rate; and

●         Expected life of option

 

Stock Warrants

 

In connection with certain financing (debt or equity), consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company may issue warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of warrants issued for compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the measurement date. However, for warrants issued that meet the definition of a derivative liability, fair value is determined based upon the use of a binomial pricing model.

 

Warrants issued in conjunction with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital of the common stock issued. All other warrants (for services) are recorded at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period or at the date of issuance if there is not a service period.

 

Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share and Reverse Stock Split

 

Basic earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method and is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and certain other shares committed to be, but not yet issued. Net earnings available to common shareholders represent net earnings to common shareholders reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities. Losses are not allocated to participating securities. Common shares outstanding and certain other shares committed to be, but not yet issued, include restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) for which no future service is required.

 

                                                                  F-24

Diluted earnings per share is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted earnings per share is computed by taking the sum of net earnings available to common shareholders, dividends on preferred shares and dividends on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred shares, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and certain other shares committed to be, but not yet issued, plus all dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period (stock options, warrants, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt).

 

Preferred shares and unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method of earnings per share.

 

Unvested shares of common stock are excluded from the denominator in computing net loss per share.

 

Restricted stock and RSUs granted as part of share-based compensation contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents, respectively, and therefore, prior to the requisite service being rendered for the right to retain the award, restricted stock and RSUs meet the definition of a participating security. RSUs granted under an executive compensation plan are not considered participating securities as the rights to dividend equivalents are forfeitable.

 

The following potentially dilutive equity securities outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Warrants and stock options included as commons stock equivalents represent those that are fully vested and exercisable. See Note 9.

 

Based on the potential common stock equivalents noted above at March 31, 2024, the Company has sufficient authorized shares of common stock (50,000,000) to settle any potential exercises of common stock equivalents.

 

On April 27, 2023, the Company executed a 1-for-8 reverse stock split and decreased the number of shares of its authorized common stock from 500,000,000 shares to 50,000,000 and its preferred stock from 50,000,000 to 5,000,000. As a result, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to the earliest period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 

                                                                  F-25

Recent Accounting Standards

 

Changes to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU’s on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

 

This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact this will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 

There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

                                                                  F-27

EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

MARCH 31, 2024

 

Year Ended December 31, 2023

 

Note #1 – Note Payable – Related Party - Material Stockholder greater than 5% and related Loss on Debt Extinguishment

 

During 2023, the Company originally executed a six-month (6) note payable with a face amount of $1,500,000, less an original issue discount of $150,000, along with an additional $140,000 in transaction related fees (total debt discount and issue costs of $290,000), resulting in net proceeds of $1,210,000. The $290,000 in debt discounts and issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the note to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 

In connection with obtaining this debt, the Company also committed 250,000 shares of common stock to the lender as additional interest expense (commitment fee). Under the terms of the agreement, only 100,000 shares of common stock were required to be issued on the commitment date resulting in a fair value of $256,000 ($2.56/share), based upon the quoted closing price. The Company recorded this amount as a debt discount which was being amortized over the life of the note. Total debt discounts recorded aggregated $546,000.

 

See Note 8.

 

In October 2023 (the initial maturity date), the Company executed a loan extension with the lender to extend the due date from October 2023 to April 2024. At this time, the remaining 150,000 shares were issued to the lender.

 

The Company evaluated the modification of terms under ASC 470-50, “Debt - Modification and Extinguishment”, and concluded that the extension of the maturity date resulted in significant and consequential changes to the economic substance of the debt and thus resulted in an extinguishment of the debt.

 

Specifically, on the date of modification, the Company determined that the present value of the cash flows of the modified debt instrument was greater than 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original debt instrument.

 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $291,000 as follows:

 Schedule of Loss on Debt Extinguishment

Fair value of debt and common stock on extinguishment date*                                                 $               1,791,000 

Fair value of debt subject to modification                                                                                  1,500,000 

Loss on debt extinguishment - related party                                                                 $                 291,000 

 

   * The Company valued the issuance of the 150,000 commitment shares at $291,000, based upon the quoted closing trading price on the

      date of modification

      ($1.94/share).

 

                                                                  F-31



                                                                                                                                        

 

EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

MARCH 31, 2024

 

Pursuant to the January 17, 2024 global amendment, effective for all previously issued notes with this lender, in the event of default, the lender may convert the note into shares of common stock equal to the greater of $1.23 and the lower of the average VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days; or the greater of the average of the VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days or a floor price of $0.70. Additionally, if the Company raises $10,000,000 or more, then Note #3 will be repaid. If the Company raises $15,000,000 or more, then both Notes #2 and #3 will be repaid.

 

The Company has determined that in the event of default, the note at that time may be treated as a derivative liability subject to financial reporting at fair value and related mark to market adjustments in subsequent reporting periods.

 

This note is subject to cross-default. In the event this note or any other notes issued by this lender are in default (Notes #1, #2 and #3), all of the notes with this lender will be considered in default.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company is not in default on this note and believes it is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the note. See May 9, 2024 loan date extension below.

 

This lender is considered a related party since it has a greater than 5% controlling interest in the Company’s outstanding common stock.

 

Note #2 – Note Payable – Related Party - Material Stockholder greater than 5%

 

During 2023, the Company executed a six-month (6) note payable with a face amount of $600,000, less an original issue discount of $60,000, along with an additional $28,900 in transaction related fees (total debt discount and issue costs in cash of $88,900), resulting in net proceeds of $511,100.

 

In connection with obtaining this note, the Company also issued 150,000 shares of common stock to the lender having a fair value of $406,500, based upon the quoted closing trading price ($2.71/share).

 

The issuance of these shares resulted in an additional debt issue cost. In total, the Company recorded debt discounts/issuance costs of $495,400 which is being amortized over the life of the note to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 

See Note 8.

 

                                                                  F-32

MARCH 31, 2024

 

While the note is initially due in March 2024, the Company has the right to extend the note by an additional six-months (6) to September 2024. The note was not formally extended on its maturity date, however, the lender has not given notice on default.

 

Pursuant to the January 17, 2024 global amendment, effective for all previously issued notes with this lender, in the event of default, the lender may convert the note into shares of common stock equal to the greater of $1.23 and the lower of the average VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days; or the greater of the average of the VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days or a floor price of $0.70. Additionally, if the Company raises $10,000,000 or more, then Note #3 will be repaid. If the Company raises $15,000,000 or more, then both Notes #2 and #3 will be repaid.

Note #3 – Note Payable – Related Party - Material Stockholder greater than 5%

 

In October 2023, the Company executed a three-month (3) note payable with a face amount of $320,000, less an original issue discount of $48,000, resulting in net proceeds of $272,000.

 

In connection with obtaining this note, the Company was required to issue 260,000 shares* of common stock to the lender having a fair value of $539,760, based upon the quoted closing trading price ($2.076/share). However, the issuance of these shares would result in the lender having a greater than 9.99% ownership of the Company, which is prohibited by agreement. These shares are classified as common stock issuable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The future issuance of these shares resulted in an additional debt issue cost. In total, the Company recorded debt discounts/issuance costs of $320,000 which is being amortized over the life of the note to interest expense. The aggregate discounts calculated above exceeded the face amount of the note and therefore were limited to the face amount of the note totaling $320,000.

 

Pursuant to the January 17, 2024 global amendment, effective for all previously issued notes with this lender, in the event of default, the lender may convert the note into shares of common stock equal to the greater of $1.23 and the lower of the average VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days; or the greater of the average of the VWAP over the ten (10) preceding trading days or a floor price of $0.70. Additionally, if the Company raises $10,000,000 or more, then Note #3 will be repaid. If the Company raises $15,000,000 or more, then both Notes #2 and #3 will be repaid.

 

The Company has determined that in the event of default, the note at that time may be treated as a derivative liability subject to financial reporting at fair value and related mark to market adjustments in subsequent reporting periods.

 

This note is subject to cross-default. In the event this note or any other notes issued by this lender are in default (Notes #1, #2 and #3), all of the notes with this lender will be considered in default.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company is not in default on this note and believes it is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the note. See May 9, 2024 loan date extension below.

 

This lender is considered a related party since it has a greater than 5% controlling interest in the Company’s outstanding common stock.

 

In January 2024, with respect to Notes #2 and #3 discussed above, as a result of extending the note maturity dates as amended to April 19, 2024, the Company was required to issue 180,000 shares of common stock. However, the issuance of these shares would result in the lender having a greater than 9.99% ownership of the Company, which is prohibited by agreement. These shares will be classified as common stock issuable.

 

The Company determined the fair value of these shares was $270,000 ($1.50/share), based upon the quoted closing trading price, and recorded additional interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reflected 440,000 and 260,000 shares, respectively as common stock issuable.

 

Extension of Notes #1, #2 and #3

 

On May 9, 2024, with respect to Notes #1, #2 and #3 discussed above, as a result of extending the note maturity dates as amended to July 17, 2024, the Company was required to issue 165,000 shares of common stock.

 

The Company determined the fair value of these shares was $407,550 ($2.47/share), based upon the quoted closing trading price, and will record additional interest during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

 

                                                                  F-34

Notes Payable – Related Party

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company executed several two-month (2) notes payable with an aggregate face amount of $1,375,000, less original issue discounts of $125,000, resulting in net proceeds of $1,250,000.

 

In connection with obtaining these notes, the Company was required to issue 190,722 shares of common stock to the lender having a fair value of $345,893, based upon the quoted closing trading price ($1.68 - $1.93/share).

 

In total, the Company recorded debt discounts/issuance costs of $470,893 which is being amortized over the life of these notes to interest expense.

 

These notes are initially due two-months (2) from their issuance dates. If the notes reach maturity and are still outstanding, the notes and related accrued interest will automatically renew for successive two-month (2) periods.

 

These notes bear interest at 8% for the 1st nine-months (9), then 18% each month thereafter.

 

The lender is required to issue in writing any event of default. If an event of default occurs, all outstanding principal and accrued interest will be multiplied by 150% and become immediately due. Additionally, if the Company raises $3,000,000 (debt or equity based), the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest are immediately due.

 

Finally, in an event of default, the lender has the right to convert any or all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest into common stock equal to the greater of the average VWAP closing price over the ten (10) trading days ending on the date of conversion or $0.70 (the floor price). In the event such a conversion were to occur, which can only happen by default, the Company would evaluate the potential for recording derivative liabilities.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company is not in default on any of these notes and believes it is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the notes.

 

This lender is considered a related party as it is controlled by Michael Farkas, an approximate 20% stockholder in the Company.

Line of Credit

 

Year Ended December 31, 2023

 

In 2021, the Company entered into a Securities-Based Line of Credit, Promissory Note, Security, Pledge and Guaranty Agreement (the “Line of Credit”) with City National Bank of Florida.

 

The line of credit had an outstanding balance of $1,000,000 at December 31, 2022 and was repaid in 2023 for $1,008,813 (principal of $1,000,000 plus accrued interest of $8,813).

 

To secure the repayment of the Credit Limit, the Bank had a first priority lien and continuing security interest in the securities held in the Company’s investment portfolio with the Bank. The Company liquidated its entire position in the investment portfolio in 2023.

 

In connection with the repayment of the line of credit, no further advances had been made and the bank closed the line of credit.

 

Note 6 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made.

 

The Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

                                                                  F-39

Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies

 

Operating Leases

 

We have entered into various operating lease agreements, including our corporate headquarters. We account for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842: Leases, which requires a lessee to utilize the right-of-use model and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. In addition, a lessor is required to classify leases as either sales-type, financing or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as financing. If the lessor does not convey risk and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.

 

Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at commencement are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement to determine the present value of lease payments except when an implicit interest rate is readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on market sources including relevant industry data.

 

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

 

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

 

                                                                  F-40



                                                                                                                                        

 

EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

MARCH 31, 2024

 

Our leases, where we are the lessee, do not include an option to extend the lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease term would include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.

 

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense, included as a component of general and administrative expenses, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 

Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate, our lease has no stated increase, payments were fixed at lease inception. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred.

 

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had no financing leases as defined in ASC 842, “Leases.”

 

On December 3, 2021, the Company signed a lease for 5,778 square feet of office space, for occupancy effective January 1, 2022. The lease term is 39 months, and the total monthly payment is $21,773, including base rent, estimated operating expenses and sales tax.

 

The initial base rent of $14,743 including sales tax was abated for months 1, 13 and 25 of the lease and is subject to a 3% annual increase. An initial Right of Use (“ROU”) asset of $735,197 was recognized as a non-cash asset addition.

 

                                                                  F-41

The Company has issued various equity grants to board directors, officers, consultants and employees. These grants typically contain a vesting period of one to three years and require services to be performed in order to vest in the shares granted.

 

The Company determines the fair value of the equity grant on the issuance date based upon the quoted closing trading price. These amounts are then recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period and are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 

The Company recognizes forfeitures of restricted shares as they occur rather than estimating a forfeiture rate. Any unvested share based compensation is reversed on the date of forfeiture, which is typically due to service termination.

 

At March 31, 2024, unrecognized stock compensation expense related to restricted stock was $176,800, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.29 years

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized compensation expense of $147,334 and $192,061, related to the vesting of these shares.

 

                                                                  F-49

Year Ended December 31, 2023

 

The Company granted 254,824 stock options, having a fair value of $73,920.

 

Of the total, 54,824 were granted to our former Chief Executive Officer in lieu of accrued salary totaling $50,000. These options were fully vested on the grant date.

 

The remaining 200,000 options were granted to consultants for a project that was cancelled in 2023. As a result, the Company recorded a grant date fair value of $23,920. All previously recorded stock based compensation ($7,973) was reversed in 2023. There was a net effect of $0 on the consolidated statements of operations for this grant.

 

The fair value of the stock options granted in 2023 were determined using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model with the following assumptions:

Upon Closing, the board of directors of the Company will appoint Michael Farkas as Chief Executive Officer, Director and Executive Chairman of the Company.

The Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) that the Company take the actions necessary to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of the requisite stockholder approval, (iii) the receipt of the requisite third-party consents and (iv) compliance with the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market.

Note 10 – Subsequent Events

 

Notes Payable Related Party – Material Stockholder greater than 20%

 

Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company executed several two-month (2) notes payable with an aggregate face amount of $495,000, less original issue discounts of $45,000, resulting in net proceeds of $450,000.

 

These notes are initially due two-months (2) from their issuance dates. If the notes reach maturity and are still outstanding, the notes and related accrued interest will automatically renew for successive two-month (2) periods.

 

These notes bear interest at 8% for the 1st nine-months (9), then 18% each month thereafter.

 

In connection with obtaining these notes, the Company also issued 156,000 shares of common stock to the lender, which will be accounted for as a debt discount.

 

The lender is required to issue in writing any event of default. If an event of default occurs, all outstanding principal and accrued interest will be multiplied by 150% and become immediately due. Additionally, if the Company raises $3,000,000 (debt or equity based), the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest are immediately due.

 

Finally, in an event of default, the lender has the right to convert any or all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest into common stock equal to the greater of the average VWAP closing price over the ten (10) trading days ending on the date of conversion or $0.70 (the floor price). In the event such a conversion were to occur, which can only happen by default, the Company would evaluate the potential for recording derivative liabilities.

 

This lender is considered a related party as it is controlled by Michael Farkas, an approximate 20% stockholder in the Company.

 

See Note 5 for all other related note issuances with his lender.

 

                                                                  F-53

NASDAQ – Continued Listing Rule or Standard

 

As previously disclosed, on August 22, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company’s stockholders’ equity did not comply with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b) (the “Equity Rule”). Upon submission of the Company’s plan to regain compliance, the Staff granted the Company an extension until February 20, 2024 to comply with this requirement.

 

On February 21, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter (the “Delist Letter”) from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. Specifically, the Company did not complete its proposed transaction to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and evidence compliance on or before February 20, 2024. See Form 8-K filed on February 23, 2024.

 

The Company had requested an appeal for the Staff’s determination. A hearing occurred on May 2, 2024. At the hearing, the Company presented its plan for regaining compliance with the Equity Rule and may request a further extension to complete the execution of its plan. No assurance can be provided that Nasdaq will ultimately accept the Company’s plan or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with the Equity Rule.

 

                                                                  F-54

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we use in our financial performance analyses. This measure should not be considered a substitute for GAAP-basis measures, nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of our financial results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from ours for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability.

 

                                                                   3



                                                                                                                                        

 

The following is a reconciliation of net loss to the non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

Three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023

 

Revenues

 

We generated revenues of $6,597,119 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5,231,334 for the prior year, an increase of $1,365,785 or 26%. This increase is primarily due to a 26% increase in gallons delivered and an increase in related fees. The additional gallons were in existing as well as newly developed markets.

 

Cost of sales was $6,135,335 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5,068,783 for the prior year. The $1,066,552 or 21% increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in fuel sales as well as the hiring of additional drivers, primarily in new markets. Our gross profit improved year over year due to higher fuel revenues as well as increased delivery fees and driver efficiency.

 

Operating Expenses

 

We incurred operating expenses of $1,489,031 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2,196,646 during the prior year, a decrease of $707,615 or 32%. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in payroll, stock based compensation, marketing and public company expenses.

 

Depreciation and Amortization

 

Depreciation increased from $273,087 to $276,522 ($3,435), in the current three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to March 31, 2023, as a result of the increase in the fleet of delivery vehicles.

 

Other Income (Expense)

 

Interest expense increased from $49,749 to $659,153 ($609,404) in the current three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to March 31, 2023 in the current year due to increased borrowing from related parties during the three months ending March 31, 2024.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Cash Flow Activities

 

As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $48,613 in cash compared to approximately $504,581 at March 31, 2023.

 

Operating Activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities was $1,140,148 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was made up primarily by the net loss of $1,899,122 and offset by non-cash adjustments for a net amount of $758,974. Net cash used in operating activities was $2,513,417 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was made up primarily by the net loss of $2,348,771 and offset by non-cash adjustments for a net amount of $164,646.

 

                                                                   4



                                                                                                                                        

 

Investing Activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 net cash used by investing activities was $11,667. The cash used was to purchase equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities during the prior year was $1,150,928 resulting from the proceeds as part of the sale of marketable debt securities.

 

Financing Activities

 

We generated $973,443 of cash flows from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, including a $1,250,000 loan from a related party (an approximate 20% shareholder of the Company), less principal repayments of $276,557. We used $199,723 of cash flows from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily for the repayments of notes payable of $199,723, we also received $25,308 of proceeds for the issuance of stock from the ATM and recorded related expenses of $25,308.

 

Sources of Capital

 

The Company has sustained net losses since inception and does not have sufficient revenues and income to fully fund its operations. As a result, the Company has relied on equity and debt financings to fund its activities to date. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $1,899,122. At March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $47,216,172. The Company anticipates that it will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations through the foreseeable future.

 

The Company has limited capital and is currently relying on a related party to fund its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations. The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company’s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings. There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which are favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our working capital needs in the future, we will be forced to delay, reduce, or cease our operations.

 

Going Concern

 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had:

 

●         Net loss of $1,899,122; and

●         Net cash used in operations was $1,140,148

 

Additionally, at March 31, 2024, the Company had:

 

●         Accumulated deficit of $47,216,172

●         Stockholders’ deficit of $3,312,101; and

●         Working capital deficit of $6,343,174

 

The Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital immediately in order to continue to fund its operations. The Company has relied on related parties for the debt based funding of its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable the Company to complete its initiatives or attain profitable operations.

 

The Company’s operating needs include the planned costs to operate its business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. The Company’s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including the Company’s ability to successfully expand to new markets, competition, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies to enhance or complement its product and service offerings.

 

There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms which are favorable, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay, reduce, or cease its operations.

 

We manage liquidity risk by reviewing, on an ongoing basis, our sources of liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had cash on hand of $48,613 at March 31, 2024.

 

The Company has historically incurred significant losses since inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues from the sales of its products and services to achieve profitable operations. In making this assessment we performed a comprehensive analysis of our current circumstances including: our financial position, our cash flows and cash usage forecasts for the twelve months ended March 31, 2025, and our current capital structure including equity-based instruments and our obligations and debts.

 

These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent to the date that these financial statements are issued.

 

                                                                   5



 

 

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and those differences may be material.

 

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

 

Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those estimates may be material.

 

Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which include both quantitative and qualitative assessments that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

 

Significant estimates include, allowance for doubtful accounts and other receivables, inventory reserves and classifications, valuation of loss contingencies, valuation of stock-based compensation, estimated useful lives related to property and equipment, impairment of intangible assets, implicit interest rate in right-of-use operating leases, uncertain tax positions, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

 

Accounts Receivable 

 

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding customer balances. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable. The Company does not require collateral.

 

Management periodically assesses the Company’s accounts receivable and, if necessary, establishes an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information and existing economic conditions. Accounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to operations when that determination is made.

 

Inventory

 

Inventory consists solely of fuel. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of inventory valuation. Management assesses the recoverability of its inventory and establishes reserves on a quarterly basis.

 

                                                                   6



 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company generates its revenue from mobile fuel sales, either as a one-time purchase, or through a monthly membership. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and includes a delivery fee for each delivery or a subscription fee on a monthly basis for memberships.

 

Under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any sales incentives, discounts, rebates, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The Company’s contracts with its customers do not include multiple performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.

 

The following represents the analysis management has considered in determining its revenue recognition policy:

 

Identify the contract with a customer

 

A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.

 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

 

Determine the transaction price

 

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.

 

None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component.

 

Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract

 

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract with variable consideration, the Company must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. For example, a bonus or penalty may be associated with one or more, but not all, distinct services promised in a series of distinct services that forms part of a single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.

 

If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.

 

The Company’s contracts have a distinct single performance obligation and there are no contracts with variable consideration.

 

Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

 

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service to a customer.

 

                                                                   7



 

 

The following reflects additional discussion regarding our revenue recognition policies for each of our material revenue streams. For each revenue stream we do not offer any returns, refunds or warranties, and no arrangements are cancellable. Additionally, all contract consideration is fixed and determinable at the initiation of the contract.

 

Currently, the Company only has two separate and distinct single performance obligations in its contractual arrangements.

 

First, the Company generally recognizes membership revenues at the end of each month after services have been rendered. There are no prepaid membership revenues.

 

Second, the Company recognizes fuel sales each month after delivery has occurred.

 

Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)

 

Contract liabilities represent deposits made by customers before the satisfaction of performance obligation and recognition of revenue. Upon completion of the performance obligation(s) that the Company has with the customer based on the terms of the contract, the liability for the customer deposit is relieved and revenue is recognized.

 

Recent Accounting Standards 

 

Changes to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU’s”) to the FASB’s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU’s on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

 

This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact this will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 

There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

 

                                                                   8



 

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

Not required for smaller reporting companies.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 

As of March 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024.
