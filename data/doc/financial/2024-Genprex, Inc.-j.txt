GENPREX, INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024 

  

Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

 

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Genprex,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Genprex, Inc. Genprex, incorporated in Delaware in April 2008, is a clinical stage gene therapy company pioneering the development of gene-based therapies for large patient populations with unmet medical needs. The Company’s oncology platform utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex® Delivery System which uses lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form to deliver tumor suppressor gene-expressing plasmids to cancer cells.  The product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. The Company’s diabetes technology is designed to work in Type 1 diabetes by transforming alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In Type 2 diabetes, the Company’s technology is believed to work by replenishing and rejuvenating exhausted beta cells that make insulin.

 

Oncology Platform

 

Genprex’s lead oncology drug candidate, Reqorsa® (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) Immunogene Therapy, previously referred to as GPX-001, is initially being developed in combination with prominent, approved cancer drugs to treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (“SCLC”). REQORSA has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells, re-establishes pathways for apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells, and modulates the immune response against cancer cells. In early studies, REQORSA has been shown to be complementary with targeted drugs and immunotherapies. The Company’s strategy is to develop REQORSA in combination with current approved therapies and the Company believes REQORSA’s unique attributes position it to provide treatments that improve on these current therapies for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, and possibly other cancers. 

 

Acclaim-1: The Company is currently enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 2a expansion portion of its Phase 1/2 Acclaim-1 clinical trial. The Acclaim-1 trial uses a combination of REQORSA and AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® (osimertinib) in patients with late-stage NSCLC that has activating epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutations and progression after treatment with Tagrisso. Following the May 2023 completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study, the Acclaim-1 Safety Review Committee (“Acclaim-1 SRC”) approved advancement from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion to the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study. Based on a review of safety data which showed no dose limiting toxicities (“DLTs”), the Acclaim-1 SRC determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of REQORSA to be 0.12 mg/kg. This was the highest dose level delivered in the Phase 1 portion of the study and is twice the highest dose level delivered in the Company’s prior clinical trial combining REQORSA with Tarceva® (erlotinib) for the treatment of late-stage lung cancer. Genprex opened the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study and enrolled and dosed the first patient in January 2024.  The Phase 2a expansion portion of the trial is expected to enroll approximately 66 patients; half will be patients who received only prior Tagrisso treatment and the other half will be patients who received prior Tagrisso treatment and chemotherapy. The aim is to determine toxicity and efficacy profiles of patients with different eligibility criteria. There will be an interim analysis following the treatment of 19 patients in each cohort. The Company expects to complete the enrollment of 19 patients in each cohort of the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study by the end of 2024, and thus the Company expects the interim analyses in early 2025. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-1 treatment combination of REQORSA and Tagrisso in NSCLC patients who have progressed after Tagrisso treatment. 

 

Acclaim-2: The Company is currently enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of its Phase 1/2 Acclaim-2 clinical trial. The Acclaim-2 trial uses a combination of REQORSA and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with late-stage NSCLC whose disease has progressed after treatment with Keytruda. Patients are currently being treated at the 0.06 mg/kg dose level in the first cohort of patients and, subject to Acclaim-2 Safety Review Committee (“Acclaim-2 SRC”) approval, will be treated at successive dose levels of 0.09 mg/kg and 0.12 mg/kg. The Company expects enrollment in the dose escalation portion of the study to be completed in the second half of 2024. The Company will then initiate and evaluate patients in the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study at the maximum tolerated dose (the “MTD”) or RP2D. The FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-2 treatment combination of REQORSA and Keytruda in NSCLC patients who have progressed after Keytruda treatment. 

 

The expansion portion of both the Acclaim-1 and Acclaim-2 trials are Phase 2 studies.  The expansion portion of these studies provides the Company with the advantage of early insight into drug effectiveness in defined and distinct patient populations at the MTD or RP2D in order to better evaluate efficacy and increase the likelihood of a successful randomized Phase 2 trial which will follow the expansion portion of each study.

 

Acclaim-3: The Company is currently enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of its Phase 1/2 Acclaim-3 clinical trial. The Acclaim-3 clinical trial uses a combination of REQORSA and Genentech, Inc.’s Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) as maintenance therapy in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (“ES-SCLC”) who did not develop tumor progression after receiving Tecentriq and chemotherapy as initial standard treatment. Patients are treated with REQORSA and Tecentriq until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is experienced. In January 2024, the Company opened the Phase 1 portion of the Acclaim-3 study for enrollment and enrolled and dosed the first patient in May 2024. The Company expects to complete the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study during the second half of 2024 and the Company expects to start the Phase 2 expansion portion of its Acclaim-3 study in the second half of 2024. In June 2023, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-3 treatment combination of REQORSA and Tecentriq as maintenance therapy in patients with ES-SCLC who did not develop tumor progression after receiving Tecentriq and chemotherapy as initial standard treatment.  In August 2023, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to REQORSA for the treatment of SCLC.

GENPREX, INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

 

The TUSC2 gene, which is the key component of REQORSA and plays a vital role in cancer suppression and normal cell regulation, is one of a series of genes on the short arm of Chromosome 3 whose therapeutic use is covered by the Company’s exclusive worldwide licenses from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”). Genprex believes that its ONCOPREX Delivery System allows for delivery of a number of cancer-fighting genes, alone or in combination with other cancer therapies, to combat multiple types of cancer and the Company is in early stages of discovery programs to identify other cancer candidates. In August 2022, Genprex entered into a three-year sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson to support further preclinical studies of TUSC2 and other tumor suppressor genes. 

 

Diabetes Gene Therapy

 

In diabetes, the Company has exclusively licensed from the University of Pittsburgh of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education (“University of Pittsburgh”) multiple technologies relating to the development of a gene therapy product for each of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The same general novel approach is used in each of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes whereby an adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector containing the Pdx1 and MafA genes is administered directly into the pancreatic duct. In humans, this can be done with a routine endoscopy procedure. The Company’s diabetes product candidates are currently being evaluated and optimized in preclinical studies at the University of Pittsburgh. GPX-002 is being developed using the same construct for the treatment of both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. GPX-002 for Type 1 diabetes is designed to work by transforming alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In a similar approach, GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes (formerly known as GPX-003), where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to work by replenishing and rejuvenating exhausted beta cells that make insulin. Genprex finalized the components of the diabetes construct to take forward for nonclinical studies and in December 2023, the Company submitted a request to meet with the FDA to obtain their guidance on the nonclinical studies needed to file an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application and initiate first-in-human studies. As a result of the FDA’s response, the Company will continue with its planned additional nonclinical studies before requesting regulatory guidance in 2024 for the IND-enabling studies. In October 2023, Genprex entered into a one-year extension to its August 2022 sponsored research agreement with the University of Pittsburgh for the use of GPX-002 in a non-human primate (“NHP”) model in Type 2 diabetes. The extension includes a revised research plan to encompass the Company’s most recent technologies to which it acquired exclusive rights from the University of Pittsburgh in July 2023. These include a MafB promoter to drive expression of the Pdx1 and MafA transcription factors that can potentially be used for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  See also “Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies” to the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

 

Capital Requirements, Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations

 

The Company's unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has sustained substantial losses from operations since inception and has no current source of revenue. In addition, the Company has used, rather than provided, cash in its operations. Genprex expects to continue to incur significant expenditures to further clinical trials for the commercial development of its patents.

 

The Company recognizes that it must obtain additional capital resources to successfully commercialize its product candidates. To date, Genprex has received funding in the form of equity and debt, and the Company plans to seek additional funding in the future. However, no assurances can be given that it will be successful in raising additional capital. If the Company is not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital, the timing of its clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities.

 

Genprex believes that its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund expenditure requirements for its necessary operations and expected clinical trial activities into the third quarter of 2024. The Company has based these estimates, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and could spend available financial resources much faster than it currently expects. The Company will need to raise additional funds to continue funding its development and operations. The Company plans to secure such additional funding, although there are no guarantees or commitments for additional funding. 

 

As a result of its recurring losses from operations and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Genprex’s unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that is normally required by US GAAP can be condensed or omitted. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The December 31, 2023 condensed balance sheet was derived from the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements. Genprex’s unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”).

 

The accompanying condensed financial statements are unaudited and include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of Genprex’s condensed financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.

 

A summary of Genprex’s significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements follows.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On February 2, 2024, Genprex completed a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (“Reverse Split”) of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Reverse Split did not change the number of authorized shares of common stock or par value. All references in these unaudited condensed financial statements to shares, share prices, exercise prices, and other per share information in all periods have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect the Reverse Split (see Note 4 – Equity – Reverse Stock Split).

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of Genprex’s unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

Genprex considers all highly liquid short-term investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Any amounts of cash in financial institutions which exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limits expose the Company to cash concentration risk. The Company has cash in a money market account and had $7,967,044 and $6,490,117 in excess of FDIC insured limits of $250,000 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 

Net Loss Per Share

 

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potential dilutive shares of common stock, which includes common stock equivalents consisting of (i) 3,643,636 unexercised options granted by the Company’s board of directors and unexercised warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and (ii) 33,361 unvested restricted stock units granted by the Company’s board of directors representing the right upon vesting to receive shares of common stock as of March 31, 2024. 

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The carrying amounts reported in the condensed balance sheets for cash, money-market savings account, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these condensed financial instruments.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 2024

 

Property and Equipment

 

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and major renovations or improvements are capitalized.

 

Research and Development Costs

 

Research and development expenditures consist of costs incurred to conduct research, develop engineering materials for further study, and develop clinical strategies for current and future programs associated with the Company’s preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical trials. These expenditures are expensed in the period incurred and include payments to collaborative research partners, manufacturing partners and consultants, and clinical strategy partners, wages and associated employee benefits, facilities, and overhead costs.

 

Materials acquired to be used in clinical research, that have an alternative future use, are capitalized when the materials are acquired, and included in research and development supplies. These supplies are recognized as expense as they are consumed through use for testing or clinical activities, or have spoiled. The costs of materials that were acquired for a particular research and development activity and have no alternative future use are expensed in the period acquired. 

 

Research and development supplies purchased, valued at cost, and capitalized for future use were $2,532,226 and $2,347,488 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Intellectual Property

 

Intellectual property consists of legal and related costs associated with patents, trademarks, and other proprietary technology and rights developed, acquired, or licensed by Genprex that it believes contribute to a probable economic benefit toward such patents and activities. Costs incurred in connection with obtaining intellectual property protection, such as patent applications and filing fees associated with patent protection, are capitalized. Intellectual property is stated at cost and is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

 

Genprex uses the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation for options granted to employees, independent consultants and contractors. The Company measures options granted at fair value determined as of the grant date and recognizes the expense over the periods in which the options vest or are expected to vest and related services are rendered based on the terms and conditions of the award. Generally, where the award only has a service condition, the requisite service period is the same as the vesting period.

 

Long-Lived Assets

 

Genprex reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the discounted expected future cash flows. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no deemed impairments of the Company’s long-lived assets. 

 

Recent Accounting Developments

 

Accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after March 31, 2024, are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the amendments in ASU 2023-07 will have on its segment disclosures.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the amendments in ASU 2023-09 will have on its tax disclosures.

Reverse Stock Split

 

At Genprex’s special meeting of stockholders held on December 14, 2023, the Company’s stockholders granted the Company’s board of directors the discretion to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock through an amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated to date, at a ratio of not less than 1-for-10 and not more than 1-for-50, such ratio to be determined by the Company’s board of directors. On January 19, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a 1-for-40 reverse stock split and authorized the filing of the Certificate of Amendment for the Reverse Split with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Reverse Split became effective in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment on February 2, 2024. The Certificate of Amendment did not change the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value. All references in these unaudited condensed financial statements to shares, share prices, exercise prices, and other per share information in all periods have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect the Reverse Split.

During the three months ended  March 31, 2024, and in connection with the registered direct offering, with an institutional investor, completed on March 21, 2024, Genprex (i) issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,377,112 shares of common stock at a nominal exercise price of $0.0001 per share, the remaining balance of the purchase price of each share of common stock associated with each pre-funded warrant net of the portion of the subscription price therefor paid at closing, (ii) issued warrants to purchase up to 1,542,112 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $4.09 per share, (iii) issued warrants to purchase up to 92,527 shares of common stock to H.C.

The Company’s board of directors and stockholders have approved and adopted the Genprex 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”), which became effective on the completion of the Company’s IPO on April 3, 2018. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options that are intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“ISOs”), nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSU awards, performance-based stock awards and performance-based cash awards. ISOs may be granted only to employees. All other awards may be granted to employees, including officers, and to the Company’s non-employee directors and consultants.

 

A total of 104,000 shares of common stock were initially available under the 2018 Plan, plus a number of shares of common stock (not to exceed 65,719 shares) subject to outstanding awards under the Company’s 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”) as of the IPO that expire, are forfeited or otherwise terminate or that are used to cover the exercise price or applicable tax withholdings. No further grants will be made under the 2009 Plan.

 

In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each year, since  January 1, 2019, by 5% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or a committee of the board of directors appointed to administer the 2018 Plan.

 

On  January 1, 2023 and 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan was increased by an aggregate of 60,132 and 74,294 shares, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, a total of 86,418 shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.

 

2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

 

The Company’s board of directors and stockholders approved and adopted the Genprex 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective on April 3, 2018. The ESPP has not yet been utilized as a benefit available to the Company’s employees. The ESPP authorizes the issuance of 5,202 shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights that may be granted to eligible employees. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP is automatically increased on January 1 of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2019, by 2% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by the administrator of the ESPP. The administrator of the ESPP determined not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP on  January 1, 2024.

MD Anderson Cancer Center

 

In July 2018, Genprex entered into a two-year sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson to sponsor preclinical studies focused on the combination of REQORSA with an immunotherapy with a projected total cost of approximately $2 million. This agreement was extended beyond the original expiration date, expiring in May 2022 after giving effect to such extension. In August 2022, the Company entered into a three-year sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson to sponsor preclinical studies focused on REQORSA and NPRL2 in oncology to resensitize NSCLC and SCLC to targeted therapies and immunotherapies with a projected total cost of approximately $2.9 million. The Company incurred no expense from this agreement during each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has paid approximately $960,000 toward this $2.9 million commitment.

 

In 2011, the Company agreed to assume certain contractual and other obligations of IRI in consideration for the sublicense rights, expertise, and assistance associated with certain technologies and intellectual property originally licensed to another party under the 1994 License Agreement with MD Anderson (“Original MD Anderson License Agreement”). These technologies and intellectual property were later sublicensed to IRI (the “IRI Sublicense”). The Company also agreed to pay royalties of 1% on sales of certain licensed products for a period of 21 years following the termination of the later of the Original MD Anderson License Agreement and the IRI Sublicense. The Company assumed patent prosecution costs and an annual minimum royalty of $20,000 payable to the National Institutes of Health.

 

On March 3, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “MD License Amendment”) to the Patent and Technology License Agreement dated May 4, 2020, with MD Anderson. The MD License Amendment grants Genprex a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to an additional portfolio of six patents and one patent application and related technology for methods for treating cancer by administration of a TUSC2 therapy in conjunction with EGFR inhibitors or other anti-cancer therapies in patients predicted to be responsive to TUSC2 therapy. Pursuant to the MD License Amendment, the Company agreed to (i) pay annual maintenance fees ranging from the mid five figures to the low six figures, (ii) total milestone payments of $6,150,000, (iii) a onetime fee in the mid five figures and (iv) certain patent related expenses. The Company incurred no expense from this agreement during each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has paid approximately $320,000 toward this commitment under this agreement. 

 

National Institutes of Health

 

Genprex has a royalty obligation to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to be paid upon the Company’s receipt of FDA approval using NIH technology. The $240,000 contingent obligation, which increases annually by $20,000, and is $380,000 and $360,000 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and will be recognized if and when the Company obtains regulatory approval (the event that triggers the payment obligation).

Overview

 

We are a clinical stage gene therapy company pioneering the development of gene-based therapies for large patient populations with unmet medical needs. Our oncology platform utilizes our systemic, non-viral Oncoprex® Delivery System which uses lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form to deliver tumor suppressor gene-expressing plasmids to cancer cells. The product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. Our diabetes technology is designed to work in Type 1 diabetes by transforming alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In Type 2 diabetes, our technology is believed to work by replenishing and rejuvenating exhausted beta cells that make insulin.

 

Oncology Platform

 

Our lead oncology drug candidate, Reqorsa® (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) Immunogene Therapy, previously referred to as GPX-001, is initially being developed in combination with prominent, approved cancer drugs to treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (“SCLC”). REQORSA has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells, re-establishes pathways for apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells, and modulates the immune response against cancer cells. In early studies, REQORSA has been shown to be complementary with targeted drugs and immunotherapies. Our strategy is to develop REQORSA in combination with current approved therapies and we believe REQORSA’s unique attributes position it to provide treatments that improve on these current therapies for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, and possibly other cancers. 

 

Acclaim-1: The Acclaim-1 study is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that has three portions - a Phase 1 dose escalation portion, a Phase 2a expansion portion, and a Phase 2b randomized portion. We currently are enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 2a expansion portion of our clinical trial. The Acclaim-1 trial uses a combination of REQORSA and AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® (osimertinib) in patients with late-stage NSCLC that has activating epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutations and progression after treatment with Tagrisso. Following the May 2023 completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study, the Acclaim-1 Safety Review Committee (“Acclaim-1 SRC”) approved advancement from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion to the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study. Based on a review of safety data which showed no dose limiting toxicities (“DLTs”), the Acclaim-1 SRC determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of REQORSA to be 0.12 mg/kg. This was the highest dose level delivered in the Phase 1 portion of the study and is twice the highest dose level delivered in the Company’s prior clinical trial combining REQORSA with Tarceva® (erlotinib) for the treatment of late-stage lung cancer. We opened the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study and enrolled and dosed the first patient in January 2024.  The Phase 2a expansion portion of the trial is expected to enroll approximately 66 patients; half will be patients who received only prior Tagrisso treatment and the other half will be patients who received prior Tagrisso treatment and chemotherapy. The aim is to determine toxicity and efficacy profiles of patients with different eligibility criteria. There will be an interim analysis following the treatment of 19 patients in each cohort. We expect to complete the enrollment of 19 patients in each cohort of the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study by the end of 2024, and thus we expect the interim analyses in early 2025. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-1 treatment combination of REQORSA and Tagrisso in NSCLC patients who have progressed after Tagrisso treatment. 

 

Acclaim-2: The Acclaim-2 study is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that has three portions - a Phase 1 dose escalation portion, a Phase 2a expansion portion, and a Phase 2b randomized portion. We currently are enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of our clinical trial. The Acclaim-2 trial uses a combination of REQORSA and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with late-stage NSCLC whose disease has progressed after treatment with Keytruda. Patients are currently being treated at the 0.06 mg/kg dose level in the first cohort of patients and, subject to Acclaim-2 Safety Review Committee (“Acclaim-2 SRC”) approval, will be treated at successive dose levels of 0.09 mg/kg and 0.12 mg/kg. We expect enrollment in the dose escalation portion of the study to be completed in the second half of 2024. We will then initiate and evaluate patients in the Phase 2a expansion portion of the study at the maximum tolerated dose (the “MTD”) or RP2D. The FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-2 treatment combination of REQORSA and Keytruda in NSCLC patients who have progressed after Keytruda treatment. 

 

The expansion portion of both the Acclaim-1 and Acclaim-2 trials are Phase 2 studies.  The expansion portion of these studies provides us with the advantage of early insight into drug effectiveness in defined and distinct patient populations at the MTD or RP2D in order to better evaluate efficacy and increase the likelihood of a successful randomized Phase 2 trial which will follow the expansion portion of each study.

 

Acclaim-3: The Acclaim-3 study has two portions - a Phase 1 dose escalation portion and a Phase 2 expansion portion. We currently are enrolling and treating patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of our clinical trial. The Acclaim-3 clinical trial uses a combination of REQORSA and Genentech, Inc.’s Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) as maintenance therapy in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (“ES-SCLC”) who did not develop tumor progression after receiving Tecentriq and chemotherapy as initial standard treatment. Patients are treated with REQORSA and Tecentriq until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is experienced. In January 2024, we opened the Phase 1 portion of the Acclaim-3 study for enrollment and enrolled and dosed the first patient in May 2024. We expect to complete the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study during the second half of 2024 and we expect to start the Phase 2 expansion portion of our Acclaim-3 study in the second half of 2024. In June 2023, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for the Acclaim-3 treatment combination of REQORSA and Tecentriq as maintenance therapy in patients with ES-SCLC who did not develop tumor progression after receiving Tecentriq and chemotherapy as initial standard treatment.  In August 2023, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to REQORSA for the treatment of SCLC.

The TUSC2 gene, which is the key component of REQORSA and plays a vital role in cancer suppression and normal cell regulation, is one of a series of genes on the short arm of Chromosome 3 whose therapeutic use is covered by our exclusive worldwide licenses from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”). We believe that our ONCOPREX Delivery System allows for delivery of a number of cancer-fighting genes, alone or in combination with other cancer therapies, to combat multiple types of cancer and we are in early stages of discovery programs to identify other cancer candidates. In August 2022, we entered into a three-year sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson to support further preclinical studies of TUSC2 and other tumor suppressor genes. 

 

Diabetes Gene Therapy

 

In diabetes, we have exclusively licensed from the University of Pittsburgh of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education (“University of Pittsburgh”) multiple technologies relating to the development of a gene therapy product for each of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The same general novel approach is used in each of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes whereby an adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector containing the Pdx1 and MafA genes is administered directly into the pancreatic duct. In humans, this can be done with a routine endoscopy procedure. Our diabetes product candidates are currently being evaluated and optimized in preclinical studies at the University of Pittsburgh. GPX-002 is being developed using the same construct for the treatment of both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. GPX-002 for Type 1 diabetes is designed to work by transforming alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body’s immune system. In a similar approach, GPX-002 for Type 2 diabetes (formerly known as GPX-003), where autoimmunity is not at play, is believed to work by replenishing and rejuvenating exhausted beta cells that make insulin. We finalized the components of the diabetes construct to take forward for nonclinical studies and in December 2023, we submitted a request to meet with the FDA to obtain their guidance on the nonclinical studies needed to file an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application and initiate first-in-human studies. As a result of the FDA’s response, the Company will continue with its planned additional nonclinical studies before requesting regulatory guidance in 2024 for the IND-enabling studies. In October 2023, we entered into a one-year extension to our August 2022 sponsored research agreement with the University of Pittsburgh for the use of GPX-002 in a non-human primate (“NHP”) model in Type 2 diabetes. The extension includes a revised research plan to encompass our most recent technologies to which we acquired exclusive rights from the University of Pittsburgh in July 2023. These include a MafB promoter to drive expression of the Pdx1 and MafA transcription factors that can potentially be used for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  See also “Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed below and in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of March 31, 2024, accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the amendments in ASU 2023-07 will have on its segment disclosures.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the amendments in ASU 2023-09 will have on its tax disclosures.

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

Our unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these unaudited condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 

We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 

Research and Development Costs

 

We record accrued expenses for costs invoiced from research and development activities conducted on our behalf by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials and contract research, manufacturing, and testing activities. We record the costs of research and development activities based upon the amount of services provided, and we include these costs in accrued liabilities in the unaudited condensed balance sheets and within research and development expense in the unaudited condensed statements of operations. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. Purchased materials to be used in future research are valued at cost and capitalized and included in research and development supplies.

 

We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment in any of our clinical trials may vary from our estimates and could result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from contract research organizations (“CROs”) and other third-party service providers. 

 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable or at a minimum annually during the fourth quarter of the year. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying value to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value based upon discounted cash flows.

 

Components of our Results of Operations and Financial Condition

 

Operating expenses

 

We classify our operating expenses into three categories: research and development, general and administrative, and depreciation.

 

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of:

 

            •         costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our current and potential product

                       candidates;

            •         costs related to the production and storage of supplies for engineering purposes and storage and usage of

                       clinical supplies, including waste created in the process of producing clinical materials, spoilage, and

                       testing of clinical

                       materials;

            •         costs related to the use of contract manufacturers, manufacturing consultants, testing organizations,

                       cold-storage facilities, and logistics service

                       providers;

            •         fees paid to clinical consultants, clinical trial sites and vendors, including CROs in conjunction with

                       implementing and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all

                       related fees, such as patient screening fees, laboratory work, and statistical compilation and analysis;

                       

            •         costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements; and

            •         costs related to staffing and personnel associated with research and development activities, including wages,

                       taxes, benefits, leases, overheads, supplies, and share-based

                       compensation.

 

We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Clinical trial costs, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third-parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.

 

We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we (i) advance our current and future product candidates into and through clinical trials, (ii) transition some of our manufacturing activities to new vendors for a variety of reasons, such as to incorporate more advanced processes and scale production, including any additional work that has been or may be required to successfully adapt our process to these new processes, (iii) pursue regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates in the U.S. and Europe, and (iv) expand our research programs to include new therapies and new therapy combinations. The process of conducting the necessary pre-clinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our current and potential product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including the quality of our current and potential product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability, and limited contracted partners. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates, if at all.

 

24 



  

 

General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs, which include administrative and executive salaries, as well as the costs of professional services, such as accounting and legal, travel, facilities, information technology and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in future periods due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as accounting, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with being a public company.

 

Depreciation. Depreciation expense consists of depreciation from our fixed assets consisting of our property, equipment, and furniture. We depreciate our assets over their estimated useful life. We estimate furniture and computer and office equipment to have a five-year life.

 

Results of Operations

 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, and 2023

 

The following summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.

 

Research and Development Expense

 

Research and Development (“R&D”) expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $3,274,380, compared to $5,310,148 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $2,035,768, or 38%. This decrease was primarily due to (i) greater need for manufacturing costs, including the manufacture of new batches of clinical materials, additional work required to be undertaken by new vendors to successfully adapt our process to their new processes, and associated quality testing with CDMOs, and (ii) increased usage of third-parties for R&D activities, to support the ramp-up of pre-clinical and clinical programs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, as overall headcount decreased in the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period.  

 

General and Administrative Expense

 

General and administrative (“G&A”) expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2,719,667, compared to $3,950,390 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,230,723, or 31%. This decrease was primarily due to greater G&A headcount, professional services, and share-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, as overall headcount decreased in the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period.    

 

Interest Income. Interest income was $27,713 and $68,471 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing an decrease of $40,758. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances held in interest bearing accounts for the three months ended on March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense was $2,670 and $4,016 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of $1,346, or 34%. The changes in associated depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were primarily due to the timing of purchases of computer equipment for new employees and changes to accounting policies related to depreciation.

 

Net Loss. We had a net loss of $5,968,869 and $9,202,774 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing an decrease of $3,233,905, or 35%. The decrease in net loss between these periods was primarily due to (i) decrease in manufacturing services and R&D overheads, and (ii) decrease in G&A overheads, professional services, and share-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, as overall headcount and expenses were reduced from the prior year.    

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

From inception through March 31, 2024, we have never generated revenue from product sales and have incurred net losses in each year. As of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $139,657,149. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of capital stock.

 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we (i) sold an aggregate of 1,342 shares of common stock for total net proceeds of $78,355 pursuant to our JMP ATM Facility as governed by the Equity Distribution Agreement (as further described below), (ii) issued 500 shares of common stock upon the exercise of options for gross proceeds of $5,960, and (iii) completed a registered direct offerings where we sold 280,883 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. 

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we (i) sold 158,474 shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $881,946 pursuant to our HCW ATM Facility, and (ii) completed a registered direct offering in which we sold (x) 165,000 shares of our common stock, (y) pre-funded warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of 1,377,112 shares of our common stock, and (z) warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of 1,542,112 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $5.8 million. In connection with the March 2024 registered direct offering, we amended certain existing warrants to reduce the exercise price and extend the term thereof.  See also “Note 4 - Equity - March 2024 Registered Direct Offerings” to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

 

On November 18, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with JMP Securities, with respect to an at-the-market offering program (our “2022 ATM Facility”) under which we could offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. We agreed to pay JMP Securities a commission equal to three percent (3%) of the gross sales proceeds of any shares sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement, and also provided JMP Securities with customary indemnification and contribution rights. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 1,342 shares of our common stock for net proceeds to us totaling $78,355. On December 12, 2023, we provided notice to JMP Securities of our termination of the 2022 ATM Facility. The termination of the Equity Distribution Agreement with JMP Securities was effective as of December 13, 2023. 

 

On December 13, 2023, we entered into an At The Market (“ATM”) Offering Agreement (the “Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, serving as agent (the “Agent”) with respect to an at-the-market offering program (our “HCW ATM Facility”) under which we may offer and sell through the Agent, from time to time at our sole discretion, up to such number or dollar amount of shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) as registered on the prospectus supplement covering the ATM offering, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time. We have agreed to pay the Agent a commission equal to three percent (3%) of the gross sales proceeds of any Shares sold through the Agent under the Agreement, and also have provided the Agent with customary indemnification and contribution rights. See also “Note 4 - Equity - At-The-Market Offering” to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

As of March 31, 2024, we had $8,217,115 in cash and cash equivalents. 

 

We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize one or more of our current or potential product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and which is subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations, which include conducting our Acclaim-1, Acclaim-2, and Acclaim-3 clinical trials (of which Acclaim-1, Acclaim-2 and Acclaim-3 are currently enrolling) and completing preclinical work for potential other oncology candidates and completing preclinical work and conducting clinical trials for our diabetes program. We expect enrollment in each of the cohorts of the Phase 2a expansion portion of the Acclaim-1 trial to be completed by the end of 2024. We expect enrollment in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the Acclaim-2 trial to be completed in the second half of 2024. Enrollment in the Acclaim-3 clinical trial is expected to be completed during the second half of 2024 after which we expect to commence the Phase 2 portion of the Acclaim-3 trial in the second half of 2024. Until such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, drawdowns on our ATM pursuant to our Agreement with the Agent, and debt financings and we may seek to raise additional capital through strategic collaborations or transactions. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts or grant rights to others to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to curtail or cease our operations. Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations. As a result of the Company's recurring losses from operations and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively over the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 

Based on our current cash, we estimate that we will be able to fund our expenditure requirements for our current operations and planned clinical trial activities into the third quarter of 2024. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently plan due to incorrect assumptions or due to a decision to expand our activities beyond those currently planned. We previously have experienced delays in engaging clinical sites as a result of disruptions at these clinical sites caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have experienced delays in clinical trial enrollment as a result of competition for patients and additional time required in connection with our transition to the new third party CDMO and the manufacture of final drug product. Delays in the conduct of our trials could result in utilizing our capital resources sooner without advancing our clinical trials as anticipated.

 

The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:

 

                                                                          Three Months Ended March 31,       

                                                                            2024                2023        

  Net cash used in operating activities                              $       (5,297,891) $       (6,932,437)

  Net cash used in investing activities                                         (15,822)            (19,627)

  Net cash provided by financing activities                                   6,793,199           4,080,780 

  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents               $        1,479,486  $       (2,871,284)

 

Cash used in operating activities

 

Net cash used in operating activities was $5,297,891 and $6,932,437 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $1,634,546, or 24%. This decrease was primarily due to greater needs for R&D manufacturing and R&D overheads and G&A professional services and G&A share-based compensation, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, as overall headcount and expenses were reduced in the 2024 period as compared with the prior year period.  

 

Cash used in investing activities

 

Net cash used in investing activities was $15,822 and $19,627 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $3,805. This decrease was primarily due to timing associated with prosecution costs of our intellectual property. 

 

Cash provided by financing activities

 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6,793,199 and $4,080,780 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This increase of $2,712,419 was primarily due to differences among sales of common stock in capital raising activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

The Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer (currently the same person following the passing of Mr. Varner, the Company’s former President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, on May 7, 2024), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.  The material weaknesses relate to a lack of segregation of duties between accounting and other functions and the absence of sufficient depth of in-house accounting personnel with the ability to properly account for complex transactions.  

 

Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions are performed by separate individuals. Our size and nature also do not allow for our accounting staff to have depth of expertise in all areas that might be desirable, such as expertise in accounting for a variety of complex transactions. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to maintain effective segregation of duties and sufficient depth of personnel on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses. 

 

In response to the material weaknesses described above, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

 

Remediation Plans

 

Management is actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified in the management’s evaluation of internal controls and procedures. The remediation efforts, which have been or are in the process of being implemented, are intended to address the identified material weaknesses, and include:

 

    •   new accounting software, processes, and workflows to further segregate duties among limited accounting staff;

 

    •   specific review procedures, including the added involvement of our legal department to review certain accounting transactions

         following a given period in an effort to enhance accuracy of

         reporting;

 

    •   specific review procedures, including the added involvement of our manufacturing staff to enhance controls associated with

         the tracking and reporting of inventory values in our supply chain;

         

 

    •   a formal Disclosure Committee that has oversight responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of disclosures made by us

         through controls and procedures and the monitoring of their integrity and effectiveness;

         

 

    •   additional hiring of staff and development of accounting processes and policies to further segregate accounting

         responsibilities and increase the depth of our expertise in accounting for a variety of complex transactions; and

         

         

    •   additional training, testing, and certification of key accounting, finance, IT, and legal team members.

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we took actions to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal controls over financial reporting including: (i) continued evaluation and documentation of policies, processes, and controls, both manual and automated; (ii) improvements to software workflows to further segregate duties, enhance accuracy of vendor billing, and ensure transparency and oversight from vendor or project managers, department leaders, legal team members, and finance team members; and (iii) initiation of training programs for key personnel related to general IT controls and risk management as it relates to internal controls and the COSO Framework. Subsequent to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and in connection with the appointment of Mr. Confer as President and Chief Executive Officer (in addition to his position as Chief Financial Officer) of the Company on May 8, 2024 following the passing of Mr. Varner, the board of directors of the Company initiated a search for a permanent hire for the Chief Financial Officer role to succeed Mr. Confer.

 

As management continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. While remediation efforts are active, management requires additional time to demonstrate the operating effectiveness of our remediation efforts. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Because of their inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent material errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks, including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION

 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 

From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings that arise during the ordinary course of business. Although the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently have any pending litigation to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe to be material.  Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly and time consuming, and it can divert management’s attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting our overall operations.
