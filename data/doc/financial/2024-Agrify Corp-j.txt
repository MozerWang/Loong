Nasdaq Deficiency Notice

 

The Nasdaq Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.

 

On October 17, 2023, the Company received a Staff Delisting Determination (the “Staff Determination”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the Listing Rule as a result of its failure to file the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K (collectively, the “Delinquent Reports”) in a timely manner.

 

On November 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that the Company remains noncompliant with the Listing Rule as a result of its failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 with the SEC by the required filing date.

 

On December 1, 2023, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that because the Company reported stockholders’ deficit of $(17.17) million in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Primary Equity Listing Rule”), which requires that listed companies maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity. In response, the Company timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), which stayed any further action by the Listing Qualifications Staff. The hearing was held on January 11, 2024. The Company arrived at the hearing having previously cured any additional grounds for delisting as a result of delinquent periodic filings during 2023 that were filed prior to the hearing.

 

On January 30, 2024, the Company received formal notice that the Panel had granted the Company’s request for an exception through April 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Listing Rule, which was subsequently extended to May 15, 2024. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules or maintain its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Company’s common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company’s common stock or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company’s common stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the Company’s ability to raise capital.

 

On March 5, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”). The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. The compliance period for the Company will expire on September 3, 2024.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

  

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. The results reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2024.

 

Accounting for Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Agrify Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as described above, in accordance with the provisions required by the Consolidation Topic 810 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The Company includes results of operations of acquired companies from the date of acquisition. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.

 

Accounting for Less Than Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries

 

For the Company’s less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include, Agrify-Valiant LLC (“Agrify-Valiant”), and Agrify Brands, LLC (“Agrify Brands”), the Company first analyzes whether these entities are a variable interest entity (a “VIE”) in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. The Company continuously re-assesses (i) whether the joint-venture is a VIE, and (ii) if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If it is determined that the joint-venture qualifies as a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company’s financial interest in the VIE is consolidated.

 

Based on the Company’s analysis of these entities, the Company has determined that Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands are each a VIE, and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. While the Company owns 60% of Agrify-Valiant’s equity interests and 75% of Agrify Brand’s equity interests, the remaining equity interests in Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands are owned by unrelated third parties, and the agreement with these third parties provides the Company with greater voting rights. Accordingly, the Company consolidates its interest in the financial statements of Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands under the VIE rules and reflects the third parties’ interests in the consolidated financial statements as a non-controlling interest. The Company records this non-controlling interest at its initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for the third parties’ share of the respective consolidated investments’ net income or loss or equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the non-controlling interest holders based on its economic ownership percentage.

 

Going Concern

 

In accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern”, the Company’s management evaluated whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements’ issuance date. The following matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.

 

The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and has negative cash flows from operations and a working capital deficit. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $265.8 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, including limitations that may apply to the Company under applicable SEC regulations, from the capital market. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $0.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company had no restricted cash as of March 31, 2024. Current liabilities were $27.7 million as of March 31, 2024.

AGRIFY CORPORATION

 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company believes these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve-months from the date these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until the Company begins generating sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations. If the Company is unable raise additional funds, it may be forced to cease operations.

 

As of February 28, 2024, the company raised net proceeds of $2.2 million via the issuance of common stock and prefunded warrants in a public offering through Alexander Capital and is recorded within common stock and additional paid-in capital on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company intends to raise additional capital later this year to support its 2024 and 2025 funding needs. The Company also continues to make additional adjustments in headcount, salary, travel, sales and marketing spending, but there is no guarantee that these ongoing cost-cutting efforts or capital raises will be sufficient to maintain operations.

 

There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the potential future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts and notes receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the valuation of inventory, and useful life of fixed assets and intangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific information, other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management’s judgement. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual financial results could differ from those estimates.

 

Accounts Receivable, Net and Loans Receivable, Net

 

Accounts receivable, net, primarily consists of amounts for goods and services that are billed and currently due from customers. The composition of loan receivable, net is detailed in Note 5. In accordance with ASC 310-10, accounts receivable and loan receivable balances are presented net of an allowance for credit losses, which are an estimate of billed or borrowed amounts that may not be collectible. In determining the amount of the allowance at each reporting date, management makes judgments about general economic conditions, historical write-off experience, and any specific risks identified in customer or borrower collection matters, including the aging of unpaid accounts receivable and changes in customer or borrower financial conditions. Accounts and loans receivable balances are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and the potential for non-recovery is determined to be probable. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customer

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts.

 

During the year three -month period ended March 31, 2024, the Company has one customer that comprised approximately 1% of its revenue and two customers that comprised approximately 47% of its accounts receivable balance.

 

During the year three -month period ended March 31, 2023, the Company has one customer that comprised approximately 11% of its revenue and two customers that comprised approximately 84% of it accounts receivable balance.

 

Inventories

 

The Company values all its inventories, which consist primarily of significant raw material hardware components, at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined by the weighted-average cost method on a first-in, first-out basis. Write-offs of potentially slow-moving or damaged inventory are recorded through specific identification of obsolete or damaged material. The Company takes physical inventory at least once annually at all inventory locations.

 

Warrant Liabilities

 

The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments, including issued private placement stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815. The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. Management’s assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own Common Stock among other conditions for equity classification.

 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, they are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that are precluded from equity classification, they are recorded as a liability at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and subject to remeasurement on each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants to be recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Refer to Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the Company’s financial instruments.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Overview

 

The Company generates revenue from the following sources: (1) equipment sales, (2) providing services and (3) construction contracts.

 

In accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue Recognition”, the Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:

 

     ●    identify the customer contract;

 

     ●    identify performance obligations that are distinct;

 

     ●    determine the transaction price;

 

     ●    allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and

 

     ●    recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Identify the customer contract

 

A customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable. Specifically, the Company obtains written/electronic signatures on contracts and purchase orders, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer.

 

Identify performance obligations that are distinct

 

A performance obligation is a promise by the Company to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a company’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

 

Determine the transaction price

 

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.

 

Allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations

 

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company’s contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, for which the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The standalone selling price reflects the price the Company would charge for a specific piece of equipment or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.

 

Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied

 

Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.

Significant Judgments

 

The Company enters into contracts that may include various combinations of equipment, services and construction, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once the Company determines the performance obligations, it determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on the SSP. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and the methods of estimating SSP under the guidance of ASC 606-10-32-33. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions, expected margins, and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. The Company licenses its SaaS type subscription license, whereby the customer only has a right to access the software over a specified time period. The full value of the contract is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the SaaS subscription, adjusted monthly if tiered pricing is relevant. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations for equipment sales when equipment is made available for shipment to the customer; for services sales as services are rendered to the customer and for construction contracts both as services are rendered and when the contract is completed.

 

The Company utilizes the cost-plus margin method to determine the SSP for equipment and build-out services. This method is based on the cost of the services from third parties, plus a reasonable markup that the Company believes is reflective of a market-based reseller margin.

 

The Company determines the SSP for services in time and materials contracts by observable prices in standalone services arrangements.

 

The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of royalties, revenue share, monthly fees, and service credits at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Variable consideration is typically not subject to constraint. Changes to variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.

 

If a contract has payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, the Company will assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. The Company has elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one-year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. Accordingly, the Company imputes interest on such contracts at an agreed-upon interest rate and will present the financing components separately as financial income. As of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company did not have any such financial income.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Payment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from the invoice date. The Company’s agreements with its customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise concern over delivered products or services, the Company has endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.

 

The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling activities after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised good or service. Accordingly, the Company will accrue all fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of consumer goods at the time of shipment. The Company has payment terms with its customers of one year or less and has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts not to consider the time value of money. Sales, value add, and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.

 

The Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from the satisfaction of performance obligations. There are no contract assets related to performance under the contract. The difference in the opening and closing balances of the Company’s deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment. The Company fulfills obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. The Company recognizes deferred revenue when consideration has been received or an amount of consideration is due from the customer, and the Company has a future obligation to transfer certain proprietary products.

 

In accordance with ASC 606-10-50-13, the Company is required to include disclosure on its remaining performance obligations as of the end of the current reporting period. Due to the nature of the Company’s contracts, these reporting requirements are not applicable. The majority of the Company’s remaining contracts meet certain exemptions as defined in ASC 606-10-50-14 through 606-10-50-14A, including (i) performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) the right to invoice practical expedient.

 

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on its products for materials and workmanship but may provide multiple year warranties as negotiated, and generally transfers to its customers the warranties it receives from its vendors, if any, which generally cover this one-year period. In accordance with ASC 450-20-25, the Company accrues for product warranties when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company maintained a reserve for warranty returns of $0.4 million and $0.4 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company’s reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. Additional information regarding the Company’s warranty reserve may be found in Note 3 – Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet Information, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 

Research and Development Costs

 

The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits and other expenses associated with product development. The Company incurs research and development costs associated with the development and enhancement of both hardware and software products associated with its cultivation and extraction equipment, as well as its SaaS-based software offering, Agrify Insights™ cultivation software (“Agrify Insights™”).

 

Net Loss Per Share

 

The Company presents basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company computes basic loss per share by dividing net loss available to Common Stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net loss available to Common Stockholders represents net loss attributable to Common Stockholders reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities. Losses are not allocated to participating securities as the holders of the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to share in any losses. Diluted loss per share adjusts basic loss per share for the potentially dilutive impact of stock options and warrants. As the Company has reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities including stock options and warrants, are anti-dilutive, and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.

 

Net loss per share calculations for all periods have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split effected on July 5, 2023. Net loss per share was calculated based on the weighted-average number of Common Stock outstanding.

Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements

 

ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ∙ On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued, ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard applies to all entities subject to income taxes and is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. For public business entities (PBEs), the new requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect of this guidance on its financial statements.

 

Other recent accounting pronouncements did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

 

Note 2 — Revenue and Deferred Revenue

 

Revenue

 

The Company sells its equipment and services to customers under a combination of a contract and purchase order. Equipment revenue includes sales from proprietary products designed and engineered by the Company such a VFUs, container farms, integrated grow racks, and LED grow lights, and non-proprietary products designed, engineered, and manufactured by third parties such as air cleaning systems and pesticide-free surface protection.

 

Construction contracts normally provide for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of these contracts, they are primarily structured as time-and-materials contracts. The Company enters into time-and-materials contracts under which the Company is paid for labor and equipment at negotiated hourly billing rates and other expenses, including materials, as incurred at rates agreed to in the contract. The Company uses three main sub-contractors to execute the construction contracts.

 

The following table provides the Company’s revenue disaggregated by the timing of revenue recognition:

Note 4 — Fair Value Measures

 

Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement”, the Company measures fair value at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability (the inputs) are based on a tiered fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels, as follows:

 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

 

Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or for similar markets that are not active.

 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data which require the Company to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.

 

Valuation techniques for assets and liabilities include methodologies such as the market approach, the income approach or the cost approach, and may use unobservable inputs such as projections, estimates and management’s interpretation of current market data. These unobservable inputs are only utilized to the extent that observable inputs are not available or cost-effective to obtain.

The Company has certain financial instruments which consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, warrant liabilities, and contingent consideration. Fair value information for each of these instruments as well as other balances of the Company are as follows:

 

     ●    Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue liabilities

           approximate their fair value based on the short-term nature of these

           instruments.

 

     ●    Marketable securities classified as current held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which at March 31,

           2024 and December 31, 2023, approximated fair

           value.

 

     ●    The Company’s deferred consideration was recorded in connection with acquisitions during the three months ended March 31,

           2024 and fiscal 2023 using an estimated fair value discount at the time of the transactions. As of March 31, 2024 and

           December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the deferred consideration approximated fair

           value.

 

     ●    The Company’s warrant liabilities are marked-to-market each reporting period with the changes in fair value of warrant

           liabilities recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations until the

           warrants are exercised. The fair value of the warrant liabilities are estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing

           model.

Warrant Liabilities

 

The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities on March 31, 2024 and 2023 is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair values that represent the Company’s best estimate. The volatility rate is determined utilizing the Company’s own share price and the share price of competitors over time.

 

However, inherent uncertainties are involved. If factors or assumptions change, the estimated fair values could be materially different.

 

The following table summarizes the Company’s assumptions used in the valuations as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Note 5 — Loans Receivable

 

A portion of the capital raised from the Company’s IPO was allocated to launch the Company’s TTK Solution program. The TTK Solution is the industry’s first-of-its-kind program in which the Company engages with qualified cannabis operators in the early phases of their business plans and provides critical support, typically over a 10-year period, which includes: access to capital for construction costs, the design and build-out of their cultivation and extraction facilities, state-of-the-art cultivation and extraction equipment, subscription to the Company’s Agrify Insights™, process design, training, implementation, proven grow recipes, product formulations, data analytics, and consumer branding.

 

Bud & Mary’s Cultivation, Inc. (“Bud & Mary’s”) - Customer 139

 

The initial payment date on the loan receivable from Bud & Mary’s is the first business day of the first full month following the commencement of commercial products sales and the maturity date is 24 months from the initial payment date. The interest rate is 16% per annum.

 

In Q3 2022, Agrify became aware that Bud & Mary’s was not in compliance with all debt covenants as defined in the loan agreement which resulted in Agrify issuing a loan acceleration letter to Bud & Mary’s on September 15, 2022, demanding full repayment of the construction loan under the loan agreement dated May 12, 2021. Consequently, the Company established a reserve of $14.7 million specifically related to Bud & Mary’s.

 

Hannah Industries (“Hannah”) - Customer 125

 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company was unable to provide additional financing to Hannah Industries under the TTK Solution program to complete the build out and development of Hannah’s cultivation business. As a result, the Company concluded that the existing receivable due from Hannah was impaired as of this date. Given the uncertainty around the customer’s ability to repay the outstanding balance of the loan as well as the absence of value attributed to any collateral from Hannah, an allowance for credit losses was recognized for 50% of the total outstanding receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. The Company recognized an allowance for credit losses related to the Hannah loan receivable in the amount of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2022. This allowance remains at $4.5 million as of March 31, 2024.

 

Once the project is completed, the customer will begin making monthly payments based on the harvest.

 

Nevada Holistics (“Tree house”) - Customer 24096

 

As of March 2024, Nevada Holistics has a current balance of $692 due in relation to the TTK loan. The project went live in Q2 2023. After the 90 day period for the first harvest, the customer was given an additional 6-month grace period which ended in Q1 2024. Upon completion of this grace period, the Company began invoicing the customer each month for a portion of the outstanding loan balance. The borrower will begin making monthly payments in Q2 2024 based on what is produced through harvests. Monthly payments are calculated based off of the Production Success Fees (‘PSF”) generated from each harvest. Upon issuance of each invoice, that portion of the loan is reclassified into loan receivable, current on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

 

The breakdown of loans receivable by customer as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

Exchange Note

 

The Exchange Note is a senior secured obligation of the Company and ranks senior to all indebtedness of the Company. The Exchange Note will mature on the three-year anniversary of its issuance (the “Maturity Date”) and contains a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash, beginning September 1, 2022. The principal amount of the Exchange Note will be payable on the Maturity Date, provided that the Lender was entitled to a cash sweep of 20% of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with any equity financing, which will reduce the outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note.

 

Convertible Note

 

On March 8, 2023, as a result of the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued a Convertible Note to Lender with a principal balance of $10 million. The Convertible Note bears a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash, beginning April 1, 2023. The principal amount of the Convertible Note will be payable on the Maturity Date, provided that the Lender was entitled to a cash sweep of 30% of the proceeds of any at-the-market equity offering and 20% of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with any other equity financing, which would reduce the outstanding principal amount under the August 2022 Note or the Convertible Note.

At any time, the Company may prepay all of the Convertible Note by redemption at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Convertible Note plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Lender had the option of requiring the Company to redeem the Convertible Note (i) on August 19, 2023 or August 19, 2024 at a price equal to the then-outstanding principal amount under the Convertible Note plus accrued but unpaid interest, provided that the redemption right on August 19, 2023 will not be exercisable if the Company raises at least $8.0 million in gross proceeds from equity offerings prior to such date, or (ii) if the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined below) at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Convertible Note plus accrued but unpaid interest.

 

The Convertible Note imposed certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon the Company, as well as covenants that will (i) restrict the Company and its subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, (ii) restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries from making certain investments, subject to specified exceptions, and (iii) restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions. If an event of default under the Convertible Note occurs, the Lender can elect to redeem the Convertible Note for cash equal to (A) 115% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note (or such lesser principal amount accelerated by the Lender), plus accrued and unpaid interest, including default interest, which accrues at a rate per annum equal to 15% from the date of a default or event of default, or, only in connection with certain events of default, (B) the greater of the amount under clause (A) or the sum of (i) 115% of the product of (a) the conversion rate in effect as of the trading day immediately preceding the date that the Lender delivers a notice of acceleration; (b) the total then outstanding principal amount under the Convertible Note (in thousands); and (c) the greater of (1) the highest daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) per share of Common Stock occurring during the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Lender delivers such notice and (2) the highest daily VWAP per share of Common Stock occurring during the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading immediately before the date the applicable event of default occurred and (ii) the accrued and unpaid interest on the Convertible Note.

 

Until the date the Convertible Note is fully repaid, the Lender had, subject to certain exceptions, the right to participate for up to 30% of any offering of debt, equity (other than an offering of solely Common Stock), or equity-linked securities, including without limitation any debt, preferred stock or other instrument or security, of the Company or its subsidiaries.

 

If the Lender elected to convert the Convertible Note, the conversion price per share would be $7.64, subject to customary adjustments for certain corporate events. The conversion of the Convertible Note will be subject to certain customary conditions. The Convertible Note may not be converted into shares of Common Stock if such conversion would result in the Lender and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 4.99% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock, provided that upon 61 days’ notice, such ownership limitation may be adjusted by the Lender, but in any case, to no greater than 9.99%.

 

The Company evaluated the embedded features in accordance with ASC 815-15-25 and the determined embedded features are not required to be bifurcated and separately measured at fair value.

 

Aggregate interest expense related to the Convertible Note and Exchange Note described above was $116 thousand as of March 31, 2024.

 

Note Conversion

 

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement the Company entered into with the Lender on March 8, 2023, the Lender elected, on April 26, 2023, to convert $1.6 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount on the Convertible Note for 153,617 shares of Common Stock of the Company.

 

On May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with the above referenced accredited Lender (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company and the Lender agreed to exchange or redeem $2.0 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note for a total of 445,196 shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to a Beneficial Ownership Limitation of 4.99% of the Company’s Common Stock. Due to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation of 4.99%, a total of 69,568 shares of Common Stock of the Company were issued to the Lender, with the remaining 375,629 shares held in abeyance until the balance (or portion thereof) may be issued in compliance with such limitations. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on the redemption of approximately $12 thousand.

 

The total aggregated Exchange Note and Convertible Note is classified as long-term as of March 31, 2024.

Convertible Note Forgiveness

 

On November 30, 2023, the New Lender agreed to forgive $1.0 million of the principal amount outstanding on the Convertible Note (the “Principal Forgiveness”). The Principal Forgiveness was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470, as 1) the Company was determined to be experiencing financial difficulties as defined by the ASC, and 2) the Principal Forgiveness was deemed a concession by the New Lender. Per ASC 470-60-35-5, a debtor in a troubled debt restructuring involving only modification of terms of a payable (i.e., not involving a transfer of assets or grant of an equity interest) shall account for the effects of the restructuring prospectively from the time of restructuring and shall not change the carrying amount of the payable at the time of the restructuring unless the carrying amount exceeds the total future cash payments specified by the new terms. As the future undiscounted cash flows were greater than or equal to the net carrying value of the original debt, the carrying amount of the debt at the time of the restructuring was not changed.

 

CP Acqusitions Junior Secured Note

 

On October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC (the “New Lender” or “CP”), an entity affiliated with and controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, purchased the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note from their holder (the “Note Purchase”). In connection with the Note Purchase, the New Lender has agreed to waive any events of default under the acquired notes through December 31, 2023. As part of the same transaction, the Company issued a junior secured promissory note (the “Junior Secured Note”) to the New Lender. Pursuant to the Junior Secured Note, the New Lender will lend up to $3.0 million to the Company. The Junior Secured Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, will mature in full on December 31, 2023, and may be prepaid without any fee or penalty. On December 4, 2023, the New Lender and the Company amended and restated the Junior Secured Note agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the maximum principal amount that may be loaned by CP to the Company was increased to $4.0 million and extended the maturity date thereon to December 31, 2024.

 

Consolidated CP Acquisitions Note

 

On January 25, 2024, the Company and the New Lender consolidated the outstanding principal and interest due under the Junior Secured Note and the Exchange Note as well as the interest due under the Convertible Note into the Convertible Note (collectively, with the Junior Secured Note and the Exchange Note, the “Consolidated Notes”), and amended and restated the Convertible Note under a Senior Secured Amended, Restated, and Consolidated Convertible Note agreement (the “Restated Note”) having a total outstanding principal of $18,717,973 (the “New Lender Debt Consolidation”). The Restated Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and will mature in full on December 31, 2025. The Company may redeem all or a portion not less than $5.0 million of principal at any time at a price equal to 102.5% of the redeemed principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest.

 

The Restated Note imposes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon the Company, as well as covenants that will (i) restrict the Company and its subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, (ii) restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries from making certain investments, subject to specified exceptions, and (iii) restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions. If an event of default under the Restricted Note occurs, then the then outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Restated Note will immediately become due and payable.

 

If the New Lender elects to convert the Restated Note, the conversion price per share will be $1.46, subject to customary adjustments for certain corporate events. The conversion of the Restated Note will be subject to certain customary conditions. The Restated Note may not be converted into shares of Common Stock if such conversion would result in the New Lender and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 49.99% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock.

 

Immediately following the execution of the Restated Note, the New Lender elected to convert approximately $3.9 million of outstanding principal into an aggregate of 2,671,633 shares of common stock (the “January Conversion”) having a fair value of approximately $1.7 million. As the January Conversion was exercised by the New Lender in conjunction and in connection with the Debt Consolidation, the two transactions combined were considered a modification of the total debt outstanding with the New Lender (the “New Lender Debt Restructuring”).

 

The New Lender Debt Restructuring was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470, as 1) the Company was determined to be experiencing financial difficulties as defined by the ASC, and 2) the New Lender Debt Restructuring was deemed to result in a concession by the New Lender. The Company performed a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows associated with the Restructured Note subsequent to the New Lender Debt Restructuring to the carrying value of the Consolidated Notes as of the New Lender Debt Restructuring date. The net carrying value of the Consolidated Notes was determined to exceed the undiscounted future cash flows of the Restated Note after consideration of the January Conversion by approximately $675,000 (the “Excess Carrying Value”). The Restated Note was thus written down to the amount of the undiscounted future cash flows on the Restated Note from the New Lender Restructuring date to maturity. Further, as the New Lender is a related party of the Company, the Excess Carrying Value was accounted for as a capital transaction and no gain or loss was recognized related to the restructuring.

GIC Acquisition Note

 

On July 12, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of an unsecured promissory note (the “Related Party Note”) in favor of GIC Acquisition, LLC (“GIC”), an entity that is owned and managed by the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Related Party Note, GIC is obligated to lend up to $0.5 million to the Company, $0.3 million of which was delivered at issuance and the remaining $0.2 million delivered on July 31, 2023. The Related Party Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, will mature in full on August 6, 2023, and may be prepaid without any fee or penalty. The Related Party Note ranks junior to all existing secured indebtedness of the Company. On October 27, 2023, the maturity date of the Related Party Note was subsequently amended to December 31, 2024 at which point principal and accrued interest will be repaid in full. Interest expense incurred on the Related Party Note amounted to approximately $24 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has borrowed approximately $1.0 million under the Related Party Note agreement.

Note 8 — Leases

 

The determination if any arrangement contained a lease at its inception was done based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period. The lease term was determined assuming the exercise of options that were reasonably certain to occur. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception were not reflected in the Company’s balance sheet and those lease costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective term. Leases with a term greater than 12 months were reflected as non-current right-of-use assets and current and non-current lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

 

As the implicit interest rate in its leases was generally not known, the Company’s used its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for purposes of determining the present value of its lease liabilities. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s weighted-average discount rate utilized for its leases was 7.50% and 7.33%, respectively.

 

When a contract contained lease and non-lease elements, both were accounted for as a single lease component.

 

The Company had several non-cancelable finance leases for machinery and equipment. As of March 31, 2024 the Company had no active finance leases.

 

The Company had several non-cancellable operating leases for corporate offices, warehouses, showrooms, research and development facilities and vehicles. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of one year to four years, some of which include options to extend. Some leases include payment for communal area maintenance associated with the property.

Public Offerings

 

On February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement (the “Agency Agreement”) with Alexander Capital, LP as placement agent (the “Placement Agent”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 2,760,000 shares of its common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,963,684 shares of its common stock (the “S-1 Offering”). The public offering price for each share of common stock is $0.38, and the offering price for each Pre-Funded Warrant is $0.379, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock, less the $0.001 per share exercise price of each Pre-Funded Warrant. The S-1 Offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-276724) that was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 26, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on February 14, 2024.

 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agency Agreement, the Company paid the Placement Agent a cash transaction fee equal to 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds to us from the sale of the securities in the S-1 Offering. In addition, the Company reimbursed the Placement Agent for a certain amount of its accountable expenses, including the fees and disbursements of the Placement Agent’s counsel, not to exceed $100,000 in the aggregate. Additionally, at closing the Company issued to the Placement Agent common stock purchase warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) covering a number of securities equal to one percent (1.0%) of the total number of securities being sold and/or issued in the S-1 Offering. The Placement Agent Warrants are non-exercisable for one hundred eighty (180) days beginning on the date of commencement of sales of the securities being offered in this offering. Following this one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Placement Agent Warrants will be exercisable until the fifth (5th) year anniversary of commencement of sales of the securities being offered in this offering. The Placement Agent Warrants will be exercisable at a price per share of $0.38, which is equal to 100% of the price of the securities paid by the purchasers in connection with this offering. The Placement Agent Warrants are not redeemable. The Placement Agent Warrants (and the underlying securities) may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the Placement Agent Warrants (or the underlying securities) for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days beginning on the date of commencement of sales of the securities being offered in the offering. The Placement Agent Warrants, however, may be assigned, in whole or in part, to any successor, officer or member of the Placement Agent (or to officers or partners of any such successor or member) pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(2). There are no registration rights associated with the Placement Agent Warrants. Additionally, the Company granted a six-month right of first refusal for certain financings to the Placement Agent.

 

The Company issued 67,237 warrants to purchase common stock to Alexander Capital, L.P., referred to as the Placement Agents Warrants above. The warrants were classified as equity warrants and recorded under additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The warrants have a five-year term and exercise price of 100% of the offering price, and are subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions. The warrants will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants or if shareholder approval for the full exercise of the warrants are not received, in which case the Modified Warrant will also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis at Alexander Capital election.

 

The measurement of fair value of the Alexander Capital Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $0.52, exercise price of $0.38, term of five years, volatility of 128%, risk-free rate of 4.32%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). The grant date fair value of these Alexander Capital Warrants was estimated to be $31 thousand on February 27, 2024 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of March 31, 2024.

On April 29, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors, and on June 8, 2022, the Company’s stockholders, adopted and approved the 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which replaced the 2020 Stock Option Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation right awards, performance share awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be reserved and available for grant and issuance under the 2022 Plan is 26,483 shares, which includes the 10,000 shares authorized under the 2022 Plan, plus the rollover of 16,483 issued and outstanding awards under the 2020 Plan and 250,000 additional shares issued upon approval by the Board of Directors on January 8, 2024. Shares will be deemed to have been issued under the 2022 Plan solely to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an award. If any award granted under the 2020 Plan or the 2022 Plan expires, is canceled, terminates unexercised or is forfeited, the number of shares subject thereto is again available for grant under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors. As of March 31, 2024, there were 57,719 shares of Common Stock available to be granted under the Company’s 2022 Plan.

 

The Company’s stock compensation expense was $0.5 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note 13 — Net Loss Per Share

 

Net loss per share calculations for all periods have been adjusted to reflect the Company’s reverse stock splits. Net loss per share was calculated based on the weighted-average number of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding.

 

Basic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of Common Stock outstanding during the periods. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of Common Stock, including outstanding stock options, stock related to unvested restricted stock units, and outstanding warrants to the extent dilutive. Net loss per share, assuming dilution, is equal to basic net loss per share because the effect of dilutive securities outstanding during the periods, including options and warrants computed using the treasury stock method, is anti-dilutive.

 

The components of basic and diluted net loss per share were as follows:

 

                                                                                                         Three months ended March 31,  

(In thousands, except share and per share data)                                                             2024           2023      

Numerator:                                                                                                                           

Net loss available for common shareholders                                                              $         (38) $     (10,327)

Denominator:                                                                                                                         

Weighted-average common shares outstanding – basic and diluted                                              8,894,229      1,072,292 

Net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders – basic and diluted                              $           —  $       (9.63)

 

The Company’s potential dilutive securities, which include stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders is the same. The Company excluded the following potential Common Stock equivalents presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

 

                                                                                                         Three months ended March 31,  

                                                                                                            2024           2023      

Shares subject to outstanding stock options                                                                    10,206         10,562

Legal Matters 

 

From time to time, we may become involved in material legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.

 

Bud & Mary’s Litigation

 

On September 15, 2022, the Company provided a notice of default to Bud & Mary’s and certain related parties notifying such parties that Bud & Mary’s was in default of its obligations under the Bud & Mary TTK Agreement. On October 5, 2022, Bud & Mary’s filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Suffolk County, naming the Company as the defendant. Bud & Mary’s is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract and conversion arising from the Agreement. While the Company believes the claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself against Bud & Mary’s allegations, litigation is inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this matter. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company deemed it necessary to fully reserve for the outstanding $14.7 million note receivable balance due to the current litigation and the uncertainty of the customer’s ability to repay the balance. The $14.7 million represents the amount of the contingent loss that the Company has determined to be reasonably possible and estimable. The actual cost of resolving this matter may be higher or lower than the amount the Company has reserved. If the Company is unable to realize revenue from its TTK Solution offerings on a timely basis or at all, or if it incurs an additional loss as a result of the Bud & Mary’s claim, the Company’s business and financial performance will be adversely affected. On November 14, 2022, the Company filed its answers and affirmative defenses to the Bud & Mary’s complaint and counterclaims. The Company is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with the breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and enforcement of the guarantees. Bud & Mary’s is permitted to file an amended complaint, and Agrify will be permitted to make responsive filings, which may include an answer and counterclaim.

 

Bowdoin Construction Corp. Litigation

 

On February 22, 2023, Bowdoin Construction Corp. (“Bowdoin”) filed a complaint (the “Bowdoin Complaint”) in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Norfolk County naming the Company, Bud & Mary’s and certain related parties as defendants, captioned Bowdoin Construction Corp. v. Agrify Corporation, Bud & Mary’s Cultivation, Inc. and BMLC2, LLC, case no. 2382CV00173. The Bowdoin Complaint relates to a construction contract between Bowdoin and the Company relating to the property that is the subject of the Bud & Mary’s Complaint, and alleges breach of contract by Bud & Mary’s and by the Company due to nonpayment of approximately $6.3 million due under the contract and related indemnification claims and mechanics’ liens. The $6.3 million is included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet. One of Bowdoin’s subs, Hannon Electric, Inc. has filed a separate suit against Agrify in the amount of $1.498 million. The amount is part of the $6.3 million claimed in Bowdoin’s complaint. The Company is entitled to indemnification by Bud & Mary’s and intends to vigorously defend this claim.

 

Mack Molding Co. 

 

In December 2020, the Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Mack Molding Co. (“Mack”) pursuant to which Mack will become a key supplier of VFUs. In February 2021, the Company placed a purchase order with Mack amounting to approximately $5.2 million towards the initial production of VFUs during 2021. Since February 2021, the Company increased the purchase order with Mack to approximately $26.5 million towards production of VFUs during 2021 and 2022. The Company believed the supply agreement with Mack would provide the Company with increased scaling capabilities and the ability to meet the potential future demand of its customers more efficiently. The supply agreement contemplates that, following an introductory period, the Company will negotiate a minimum percentage of the VFU requirements that the Company will purchase from Mack each year based on the agreed-upon pricing formula. The introductory period is not time-based but rather refers to the production of an initial number of units after which the parties have rights to adjust pricing and negotiate a certain minimum requirements percentage. The Company believed this approach would result in both parties making a more informed decision with respect to the pricing and other terms of the supply agreement with Mack. On October 11, 2022, the Company received a $9.4 million invoice from Mack for inventory purchased on the Company’s behalf to build VFUs. As part of the terms of the contract manufacturing agreement, Mack had the contractual right to bill the Company for any inventory that had aged greater than nine months. Due to the slowdown in the demand for the VFUs and the lack of a demand forecast that the Company could provide to the vendor, Mack exercised the right to invoice the Company for the slow-moving inventory. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owed Mack $8.4 million for purchased inventory on behalf of the Company to produce VFUs, which is included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet. On March 2, 2023, Mack filed an arbitration action seeking the amounts owed to Mack for purchased inventory. On October 27, 2023, and effective as of October 18, 2023, Mack and the Company entered into a Modification and Settlement Agreement (the “Modification Agreement”) with respect to the dispute.

AGRIFY CORPORATION



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

On February 29, 2024, the Company met its performance obligations in terms of the Modification Agreement and a gain of $1,141,587 was recorded, within general and administrative expenses, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three months ended March 31, 2024, representing the difference between the carrying value of the Contract liability owing by Agrify to Mack, prior to the execution of the Modification Agreement, and the aggregate of (a) the present value of the minimum cash payments required to be made by the Company over the term of the Modification Agreement, and (b) the fair value of the warrants issued to Mack by the Company, in terms of the Modification Agreement. The recognition of this gain also resulted in the derecognition of the Prepaid settlement asset balance, and the reduction of the outstanding accounts payable balance based on the terms of the Modification Agreement. At this time, the outstanding accounts payable balance owing to Mack, was reclassified from Accounts payable to Notes payable, current in the amount of $1,374 and Notes payable, net of current in the amount of $3,464, per the face of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, as of March 31, 2024.

 

Further, following the meeting of certain conditions, including making predetermined quarterly payments to Mack in terms of the Modification Agreement, the Company is entitled to take possession of certain VFUs that were assembled under the Supply Agreement. These quarterly payments relate to the purchase from Mack of a minimum of 25 VFUs per quarter for each quarter during 2024 and a minimum of 50 VFUs per quarter for the six quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a gain of $564,277, within general and administrative expenses, associated with the revaluation of the contingent liability, originally recognized on losing control of this inventory and offset against the inventory balance during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, on regaining control of 25 units of the VFU inventory.

 

The Company is also required to pay a storage fee of $25,000 to Mack, per month, for VFUs subject to the Modification Agreement.

 

TRC Electronics Litigation

 

The Company was named as a defendant in a complaint filed by TRC Electronics, Inc. (“TRC”) on April 13, 2023 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the Complaint, TRC asserts two causes of action against the Company: (1) breach of contract, and (2) promissory estoppel. TRC’s claims are based on allegations that the Company failed to make payments due under three purchase orders for commercial electronics parts. TRC seeks damages in the amount of $565,210, plus attorneys’ fees, costs, and post-judgment interest. The Company has filed an answer denying liability on TRC’s claims and is proceeding with discovery.

 

McCutchan, Inc.

 

In December 2021, the Company entered into a Standard Form of Agreement (“Agreement”) between Owner and Contractor whereby Valiant Group LLC (“Valiant”) is the general contractor for tenant improvements on certain real property located in Bellevue, Washington (the “Project”). McCutchan, Inc. (“McCutchan”) agreed to be a subcontractor on the Project and engaged various other subcontractors. The Company terminated Valiant as the general contractor for, among other allegations, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Following the termination of Valiant, in October 2022, the Agreement was assigned and accepted (the “Assignment”) to Agxion, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Assignment contemplates that, as a subcontractor to the Agreement, McCutchan is still bound to the subcontract agreement and will continue construction operations on the Project. The Company is pursuing Valiant in a separate litigation (the “Valiant Litigation”) to collect no less than approximately $1.4 million alleging overbilling, breach of the Agreement, and violation of Chapter 18.27 and 19.86 RCW in Washington. On March 5, 2024, McCutchan, Inc. (“McCutchan”) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Washington for King County naming the Company, Valiant, and certain related parties as defendants. In the Complaint, McCutchan asserts two causes of action against the Company: (1) breach of contract, (2) voidable contract, (3) interference with business or economic expectancy, (4) unjust enrichment, and (5) defamation. McCutchan’s claims are based on allegations of misrepresentations made by the Company to pay McCutchan for work completed on the Project as well as a failure to pay under the Agreement. In the alternative, McCutchan is alleging the Assignment is void and not a valid contract. McCutchan is seeking to collect no less than $3 million against the Company and all other named defendants. The Company, Valiant, and McCutchan have all agreed to mediate the matter. McCutchan has asked to postpone the original scheduled May 7th mediation date, and the Company, Valiant and McCutchan are collectively working to set up a new three-way mediation date. In the event the parties cannot reach an agreement in the mediation, this matter will be moved to arbitration pursuant to the mandatory arbitration clause in the Agreement.

Valiant Grouop LLC

 

Agrify filed a separate complaint against Valiant for overbilling, misrepresentation, and breach for the Treehouse project in Nevada. Valiant has failed to respond and Agrify has since submitted an entry of default to the court and is currently seeking for award in the amount of $1.5 million. However, there is no guarantee that the Court would award the full amount and no guarantee that Agrify would be able to successfully collect the full amount from Valiant.

 

Other Litigation

 

In September 2023, the Company settled a legal dispute with a specific customer which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately $0.9 million, of which $0.3 million was paid in October 2023, with the remaining approximate $0.6 million to be paid in equal monthly installments, beginning in January, 2024. This gain was recognized as part of other income, net per the consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, with the approximate $0.9 million receivable balance recognized as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets, per the consolidated balance sheet, as of March 31, 2024. The settlement also resulted in the return of equipment to the Company in October 2023.

 

The Company is currently pursuing 10 separate legal proceedings in attempting to collect approximately $2.5 million outstanding receivables. The Company is not confident that all legal proceedings and collection efforts will yield in positive results or return of equipment.

 

On April 25, 2024, Medical Investor Holdings, LLC dba Vertical Companies (“MIH”) filed a complaint against Agrify demanding $288,000. MIH purchased an XMU hydrocarbon extraction system from Precision in October 2021. MIH chose to not include installation and training in the original purchase but is now having problems with this equipment. The Company this is a meritless case.

 

The Company is also a defendant or plaintiff in a variety of other litigation matters that are individually insignificant. The timing and amount of any settlements, including potential payments made or received, is uncertain. Nonetheless, management currently estimates that the Company’s aggregate net loss exposure with respect to these cases is within the range of approximately $150,000 to $300,000.

 

On July 2022, claimant, an ex-sales VP is claiming he is owed back wages, commission and is entitled to equity in the company, under theories of liability under Massachusetts labor laws including retaliation, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, tortious interference & unjust enrichment. Company has filed its answer to the initial complaint in January 2023. The Company believes this is a meritless case and has responded to various discovery requests.

Overview

 

We are a developer of proprietary precision hardware and software grow solutions for the indoor commercial agriculture industry and provides equipment and solutions for cultivation, extraction, post-processing, and testing for the cannabis and hemp industries. We believe we are the only company with an automated and fully integrated grow solution in the industry. Our Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution seamlessly combines our integrated hardware and software offerings with a broad range of associated services including consulting, engineering, and construction and is designed to deliver the most complete commercial indoor farming solution available from a single provider. The totality of our product offerings and service capabilities forms an unrivaled ecosystem in what has historically been a highly fragmented market. As a result, we believe we are well situated to create a dominant market position in the indoor agriculture sector.

 

Agrify Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 6, 2016, originally incorporated as Agrinamics, Inc. (or “Agrinamics”). On September 16, 2019, Agrinamics amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to Agrify Corporation.

 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Billerica, Massachusetts. We also lease properties located within various geographic regions in which we conduct business, including Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Oregon.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

On July 5, 2023, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock, All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated.

 

Recent Business Developments

 

At the beginning of 2023, we announced a strategic plan to foster sustainable long-term growth through cost efficiencies and enhanced sales and growth initiatives. We have been focused on growing our cultivation business by helping our existing Agrify Total Turn-Key customers to bring their facilities online and driving additional sales through our RDP. As a result, we have successfully installed and commenced our Las Vegas customer, Nevada Holistic Medicine, our Denver Colorado customer, Denver Greens, and signed several new customers such as Golden Lake Business Park in California, and Harvest Works in New Jersey. As a testimony to the Vertical Farming Unit’s (“VFU”) ability to produce high quality flower, Nevada Holistic Medicine is already consistently harvesting 9 pounds of A-grade flower per VFU, or roughly 64 grams per canopy square foot, and seeing 90%+ A-grade flower produced with exceptional color, trichome, and terpene levels.

 

34

 

 

Similarly, since we have streamlined our expansive extraction portfolio of technologies, we have successfully supported the deployment of several turnkey solvent-based and solventless extraction packages to customers in California, Michigan, and the East Coast. In addition, we have released several new technologies and products into the market based on customer feedback, including our first peer-reviewed Cannabeast 13 Distillation Unit, a Diamond Miner, Stitch-less Double Filtration Rosin Bags, and the revamped PX30 Hydrocarbon Extractor. We have also made significant strides to receive UL Compliance for Precision Extractions’ EXP Explosion Proof Rooms in an effort to continue our commitment to safety and quality within cannabis extraction facilities.

 

These industry developments illustrate the continuous innovation, and commitment to safety within the cannabis sector as our company adapts to evolving market demands. More importantly, our growing partnership across the Country is a strong testimony to operators’ continued trust in Agrify’s team and technologies in the most competitive markets.

On January 25, 2024, following stockholder approval at an annual meeting of stockholders on January 8, 2024, we and the New Lender consolidated the outstanding principal and interest due under the Junior Secured Note and the Exchange Note into the Convertible Note and amended and restated the Convertible Note (as amended and restated, the “Restated Note”), with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $18.9 million at the time of issuance of the Restated Note. The Restated Note amended the terms of the Convertible Note by, among other things, (i) reducing the conversion price to $1.46 per share of common stock, (ii) increasing the beneficial ownership limitation to 49.99% with respect to any individual or group, provided that the New Lender may assign its right to receive shares upon conversion to Mr. Chang and/or Ms. Chan or their affiliates, in which case the 49.99% beneficial ownership limitation will apply to each of them individually, (iii) extending the maturity date to December 31, 2025, (iv) increasing the interest rate from 9% to 10% per annum, (v) increasing the default interest from 15% to 18% per annum, and (vi) providing for the payment of interest every six months, or in lieu of cash interest payments, we may issue shares as payments-in-kind at a conversion price equal to the higher of (i) $1.46 or (ii) a 20% discount to our trailing seven-day volume weighted average price as of the date of interest payment. Immediately following the execution of the Restated Note, the New Lender immediately elected to convert approximately $3.9 million of outstanding principal into an aggregate of 2,671,633 shares of common stock, and assigned its rights to receive such shares to entities affiliated with Mr. Chang and Ms. Chan. Following the conversion, there was $15.0 million in principal amount outstanding under the Restated Note.

 

Nasdaq Notices and Hearing

 

On October 17, 2023, we received a Staff Delisting Determination (the “Staff Determination”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the Listing Rule as a result of our failure to file the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K (collectively, the “Delinquent Reports”) in a timely manner. We filed each of the Delinquent Reports between November 28, 2023 and January 3, 2024.

On December 1, 2023, we received a notice Nasdaq stating that because we reported stockholders’ equity of $(17.17) million in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires that listed companies maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity.

 

We timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), which hearing was held on January 11, 2024. At the hearing, we presented a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On January 30, 2024, we received formal notice that the Panel had granted our request for an exception through April 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with Rule 5550(b)(1), which was subsequently extended to May 15, 2024. As a result, there can be no assurance that we can regain compliance by the end of the extension period.

 

Additionally, on March 5, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”). The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H). The compliance period for us will expire on September 3, 2024.

 

We can provide no assurances that the listing of our common stock will be restored or that we otherwise will remain listed on Nasdaq. If we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to delist our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair stockholders’ ability to sell or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.

 

Public Offering

 

On February 27, 2024, we entered into a placement agency agreement with Alexander Capital, LP as placement agent, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 2,760,000 shares of common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,963,684 shares of common stock. The public offering price for each share of common stock was $0.38, and the offering price for each pre-funded warrant was $0.379, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock, less the $0.001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The Offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 26, 2024 and was declared effective on February 14, 2024. Raymond Chang, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, participated in the offering on the same terms as other investors. The net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $2.2 million, after deducting placement agent fees and commissions and expenses. The public offering closed on February 28, 2024.

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts and notes receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and useful life of fixed assets and intangible assets.

 

Financial Overview

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

 

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which include estimates related to accruals, stock-based compensation expense, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Overview

 

We generate revenue from the following sources: (1) equipment sales, (2) providing services and (3) construction contracts.

 

In accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue Recognition”, we recognize revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:

 

     ●    identify the customer contract;

     

     ●    identify performance obligations that are distinct;

 

     ●    determine the transaction price;

     

     ●    allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and

     

     ●    recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Identify the customer contract

 

A customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both use and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability, and consideration is probable. Specifically, we obtain written/electronic signatures on contracts and a purchase order, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer.

 

Identify performance obligations that are distinct

 

A performance obligation is a promise by us to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

 

37

 

  

Determine the transaction price

 

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.

 

Allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations

 

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. Our contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, for which we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific piece of equipment or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.

 

Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied

 

Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.

 

Significant Judgments

 

We enter into contracts that may include various combinations of equipment, services and construction, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, it determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on the SSP. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.

 

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and the methods of estimating SSP under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10-32-33. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions, expected margins, and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. We license our software as a SaaS type subscription license, whereby the customer only has a right to access the software over a specified time period. The full value of the contract is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the SaaS subscription, adjusted monthly if tiered pricing is relevant. We typically satisfy our performance obligations for equipment sales when equipment is made available for shipment to the customer; for services sales as services are rendered to the customer and for construction contracts both as services are rendered and when contract is completed.

 

We utilize the cost-plus margin method to determine the SSP for equipment and build-out services. This method is based on the cost of the services from third parties, plus a reasonable markup that we believe is reflective of a market-based reseller margin.

 

We determine the SSP for services in time and materials contracts by observable prices in standalone services arrangements.

 

We estimate variable consideration in the form of royalties, revenue share, monthly fees, and service credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Variable consideration is typically not subject to constraint. Changes to variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.

 

38

 

 

If a contract has payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, we will assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one-year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. Accordingly, we impute interest on such contracts at an agreed upon interest rate and will present the financing components separately as financial income. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any such financial income.

 

Payment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Our agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.

 

We have elected to treat shipping and handling activities after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised good or service. Accordingly, we will accrue all fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of consumer goods at the time of shipment. We have payment terms with its customers of one year or less and has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts not to consider the time value of money. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.

 

We receive payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from the satisfaction of performance obligations. There are no contract assets related to performance under the contract. The difference in the opening and closing balances of our deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance and the customer’s payment. We fulfill obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Accounts receivables are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize deferred revenue when consideration has been received or an amount of consideration is due from the customer, and we have a future obligation to transfer certain proprietary products.

 

In accordance with ASC 606-10-50-13, we are required to include disclosure on its remaining performance obligations as of the end of the current reporting period. Due to the nature of our contracts, these reporting requirements are not applicable. The majority of our remaining contracts meet certain exemptions as defined in ASC 606-10-50-14 through 606-10-50-14A, including (i) performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) the right to invoice practical expedient.

 

We generally provide a one-year warranty on our products for materials and workmanship but may provide multiple year warranties as negotiated, and will pass on the warranties from its vendors, if any, which generally covers this one-year period. In accordance with ASC 450-20-25, we accrue for product warranties when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

 

Accounting for Business Combinations

 

We allocated the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, contingent consideration arrangements, and pre-acquisition contingencies.

 

Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.

 

39

 

 

Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:

 

     ●    future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts,

           and acquired developed

           technologies;

     

     ●    expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from

           the projects when

           completed;

     

     ●    the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand

           will continue to be used in the combined company’s product

           portfolio;

     

     ●    cost of capital and discount rates; and

     

     ●    estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize.

 

The fair value estimates related to the various identified intangible assets were determined under various valuation approaches including the Income Approach, Relief-from-Royalty Method, and Discounted Cash Flow Method. These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted-average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.

 

Capitalization of Internal Software Development Costs

 

We capitalize certain software engineering efforts related to the continued development of Agrify Insights software under ASC 985-20. Costs incurred during the application development phase are only capitalized once technical feasibility has been established and the work performed will result in new or additional functionality. The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation, as well as consulting fees for third-party software developers working on these projects. Costs related to the research and development are expensed as incurred until technical feasibility is established as well as post-implementation activities. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from two to five years.

 

Income Taxes

 

We account for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.

 

We follow the provisions of ASC 740-10-25-5, “Basic Recognition Threshold.” When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10-25-6, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. We believe our tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, we have not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

 

40

 

 

We recognize the benefit of a tax position when it is effectively settled. ASC 740-10-25-10, “Basic Recognition Threshold” provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. ASC 740-10-25-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions considered effectively settled, we recognize the full amount of the tax benefit.

 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

 

We follow the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation.” ASC Topic 718 establishes standards surrounding the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. ASC Topic 718 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions, such as options issued under our Stock Option Plans.

 

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free market interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life, and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock.

 

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock options and warrants have characteristics different from those of our traded stock, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of such stock options. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities with a term similar to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is based upon our history of having never issued a dividend and management’s current expectation of future action surrounding dividends. We calculate the expected volatility of the stock price based on the corresponding volatility of our peer group stock price for a period consistent with the underlying instrument’s expected term. The expected lives for such grants were based on the simplified method for employees and directors.

 

In arriving at stock-based compensation expense, we estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on its turn-over historical experience. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in our financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to expense recognized in our financial statements. The expense we recognize in future periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the current period.

 

It is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies disclosed above.

Revenues

 

Our goal is to provide our customers with a variety of products to address their entire indoor agriculture needs. Our core product offering includes our Agrify Vertical Farming Units (or “VFUs”) and Agrify Integrated Grow Racks with our Agrify Insights software, which are supplemented with environmental control products, grow lights, facility build-out services and extraction equipment.

 

We generate revenue from sales of cultivation solutions, including ancillary products and services, Agrify Insights software, facility build-outs and extraction equipment and solutions. We believe that our product mix form an integrated ecosystem which allows us to be engaged with our potential customers from early stages of the grow cycle — first during the facility build-out, to the choice of cultivation solutions, running the grow business with our Agrify Insights software and finally, our extraction, post-processing and testing services to transform harvest into a sellable product. We believe that delivery of each solution in the various stages in the process will generate sales of additional solutions and services.

Revenues decreased by $3.2 million, or 55% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The comparative decrease in revenue was generated primarily from decreases in revenue from facility build-outs and extraction solutions. Extraction division revenues totaled $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, design and build revenues decreased by $0.6 million due to the discontinued build-out of facilities under our TTK Solutions.

 

Cost of Goods Sold

 

Cost of goods sold represents a combination of the following: construction-related costs associated with our facility build-outs, internal and outsourced labor and material costs associated with the assembly of both cultivation equipment (primarily VFUs) and extraction equipment, as well as labor and parts costs associated with the sale or provision of other products and services.

 

The following table provides a breakdown of our cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

Cost of goods sold decreased by $2.9 million, or 61%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The comparative quarterly decrease in cost of goods sold is associated with decreases in cost of goods sold related to facility build-outs and extraction solutions.

 

Gross Profit

 

                                                                           Three months ended                                      

                                                                                March 31,

(In thousands)                                                            2024           2023           Change        % Change    

Gross profit                                                          $         729  $         988  $         (259)           (26)%

 

Gross profit totaled $0.7 million, or 28.1% of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a gross loss of $1.0 million, or 17% of total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The comparative $0.3 million first-quarter year over year decrease in gross profit, as well as the comparative decrease in gross profit margin, is primarily attributable to a smaller decrease in costs of goods sold relative to the decrease in revenue for the period. During the first quarter of 2024, we realized a gross profit margin of 33% associated with our extraction solutions revenue, while we realized a gross profit margin of approximately (169)% on our cultivation-related revenues.

 

43

 

 

On a forward-looking basis, with the full year benefit of anticipated margin contribution associated with the extraction-related revenue contributions, the Company anticipates that gross margin performance, aided by our extraction-related equipment sales, will be in a mid-teens range. We anticipate that we will be able to improve upon that expected gross profit margin performance once we are able to generate meaningful software and production fee revenues from our TTK Solutions, which we currently expect to begin in the late third or early fourth quarter of 2024.

 

General and Administrative

 

                                                                           Three months ended                                     

                                                                                March 31,

General and administrative                                            $       2,952  $       6,931  $      (3,979)           (57)%

 

General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses, associated with executive and other administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include, but are not limited to, professional fees for legal, consulting, depreciation and amortization and accounting services, as well as facility-related costs.

 

G&A expense decreased by $4.0 million, or 57%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to payroll, benefits and related expenses decrease of $1.8 million, a decrease in consulting and other related expenses of $0.3 million, a decrease in insurance expenses of $0.5 million, a decrease in legal expense of $0.2 million.

 

Research and Development

 

                                                                           Three months ended

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consisted primarily of costs incurred for the development of our Agrify Insights software, next generation VFUs, and new extraction technology and methodology, which includes:

 

     ●    employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and travel;

     

     ●    expenses incurred by the subcontractor under agreements to provide engineering work related to the development of our Agrify

           Insights software and next generation

           VFUs;

     

     ●    expenses related to our facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent

           and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other

           supplies.

 

R&D expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 63%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to the reduction in personnel, outsourced consulting and materials purchased.

 

We expect to continue to invest in future developments of our VFUs, Agrify Insights software and our extraction products. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expenses were 10.6% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 12.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of personnel, travel expenses, trade shows and advertising expenses.

 

Selling and marketing expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 71%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in payroll, advertising, and trade show expenses.

Interest expense decreased by $0.7 million, or 82%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense is attributable mainly to the decrease in principal balance on outstanding loans.

 

The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 for 1.8 million is related to the fair value remeasurement of warrants issued during March, August, and December, 2022.

 

Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest

 

We consolidate the results of operations of two less than wholly-owned entities into our consolidated results of operations. On December 8, 2019, we formed Agrify Valiant LLC, a joint-venture limited liability company in which we are 60% majority owner and Valiant-America, LLC owns 40%. Agrify Valiant LLC started its operations during the second quarter of 2020. On January 22, 2020, as part of the acquisition of TriGrow, we received TriGrow’s 75% interest in Agrify Brands, LLC (formerly TriGrow Brands, LLC), a licensor of an established portfolio of consumer brands that utilize our grow technology. The license of these brands is ancillary to the sale of our VFUs and provides a means to differentiate customers’ products in the marketplace. It is not a material aspect of our business and we have not realized any royalty income. Accordingly, we are currently evaluating whether to continue this legacy business from an operational standpoint, as well as from a legal and regulatory perspective.

 

Loss attributable to non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit (or loss) that are attributable to non-controlling interest calculated as a product of the net income of the entity multiplied by the percentage of ownership held by the non-controlling interest.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

As of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $0.1 million. Our current working capital needs are to support revenue growth, to fund construction and equipment financing commitments associated with our TTK Solutions, manage inventory to meet demand forecasts and support operational growth. Our long-term financial needs primarily include working capital requirements and capital expenditures. We anticipate that we will allocate a significant portion of our current balance of working capital to satisfy the financing requirements of our current and future TTK arrangements. These arrangements require a significant amount of upfront capital necessary to fund construction, associated with facility build-outs, and equipment. There are many factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds in the future, including the ability to generate cash from operations, raise debt capital and raise cash from the issuance of our securities. The amount of cash generated from operations is dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business strategy and general economic conditions.

 

We may opportunistically raise debt capital, subject to market and other conditions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategies, we may also raise debt capital for strategic alternatives and general corporate purposes. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

 

Indebtedness

 

We entered into one Loan Agreement and Promissory Note with Bank of America pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. We received total proceeds of approximately $779 thousand from the unsecured PPP Loan which was originally scheduled to mature in May 2022. We applied for forgiveness on the $779 thousand of our PPP Loan however was denied by the SBA. On June 23, 2022, we received a letter from Bank of America agreeing to extend the maturity date to May 7, 2025 and bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. The PPP loan is payable in 34 equal combined monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $24 thousand that commenced on August 7, 2022.

 

On March 14, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Former Lender. The Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of the SPA Note in the aggregate amount of $65.0 million and a SPA Warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock, with the potential for two potential subsequent closings for notes with an original principal amount of $35.0 million each.

 

On August 18, 2022, we entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, we partially paid $35.2 million along with approximately $300 thousand in repayments for other fees under the SPA Note and exchanged the remaining balance of the SPA Note for an Exchange Note with an aggregate original principal amount of $35.0 million and a Note Exchange Warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock. Additionally, we exchanged the SPA Warrant for a Modified Warrant for the same number of underlying shares but with a reduced exercise price.

 

On March 8, 2023, we entered into a new Securities Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the March 2023 Exchange Agreement, we prepaid approximately $10.3 million in principal amount under the Exchange Note and exchanged $10.0 million in principal amount of the remaining balance of the Exchange Note for a new senior secured convertible note (the “Convertible Note”).

 

The Convertible Note is a senior secured obligation and will rank senior to all of our indebtedness. The Convertible Note will mature on August 19, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”) and has a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash. The principal amount of the Convertible Note will be payable on the maturity date, provided that the lender will be entitled to a cash sweep of 30% of the proceeds of any at-the-market equity offering and 20% of the proceeds received by us in connection with any other equity financing, which will reduce the outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note. On October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC, and entity affiliated with and controlled by Raymond Chang, acquired the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note. As of October 30, 2023, there was approximately $6.7 million outstanding under the Exchange Note and $8.8 million outstanding under the Convertible Note.

 

At any time, we may prepay all of the Exchange Note by redemption at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Note plus accrued but unpaid interest. The holder will also have the option of requiring us to redeem the Exchange Note on the one-year or two-year anniversaries of issuance at a price equal to the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest, or if we undergo a fundamental change at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by repayments of notes payable of $0.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of $2.1 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Part I, Item, 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 

These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and are recorded in the period in which they become known. We have identified the following estimates that, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis: the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, goodwill impairment assessment, revenue recognition and cost of goods sold.

 

The significant accounting policies and estimates that have been adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are detailed in Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies included in our 2023 Annual Report and Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no changes in these policies and estimates that had a significant impact on the financial condition and results of operations for the periods covered in this Quarterly Report.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

 

For more information on new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted are included within Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, included elsewhere in the notes to consolidated financial statements covered under Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 

As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by 17 C.F.R. § 229.10, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting previously identified in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024, as amended on April 29, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024.

  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

We are implementing certain measures to remediate the material weaknesses identified in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting, including hiring additional qualified personnel, further documentation and implementation of control procedures and the implementation of control monitoring. Other than those measures, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
