Note 1: Letter from Ameri Metro, Inc. CFO

 



 

April 16, 2024

 

To Whom this May Concern and for the Record:

 

Ameri Metro, Inc. (“ARMT”) Background:

 

ARMT filed its original S-1 on June 13, 2013. ARMT is an infrastructure company specializing in highly technical toll roads, bridges, high-speed rails, and ports. Since 2013, ARMT has solidified over 100 infrastructure contracts throughout the USA and the world. All these contracts will ultimately recognize well more than $1,000,000,000 each averaging approximately $20,000,000,000 each. All contracts ultimately benefit State or Federal agencies. ARMT has solidified funding of approximately $950,000,000,000 from large financial institutions. ARMT was formed to enhance the humanitarian crisis everywhere and fund governments whereby the projects are otherwise not affordable without raising taxes.

 

Personal Background:

 

My name is Phillip M. (“Marty”) Hicks, and I am the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Ameri Metro, Inc. My brief professional background is that I have more than 40 years’ experience and have served throughout the USA as a forensic accountant, one of the most accredited forensic accountants in America. I am a former Partner for Deloitte and a veteran professional Whistleblower for the Security Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) program since its inception in August of 2011. With respect to White Collar crimes, I have assisted various U.S. Attorney’s offices and the local Federal Bureau of Investigation. I continue to work with former Federal agents. In this respect, I have extensive regulatory experience and have assisted with more than 50 Federal indictments including but not limited to; Robert Bandfield, Gregg Mulholland, Brian Sodi, Scott Key, Barry Honig and others.

 

Late Regulatory Filings:

 

We at Ameri Metro, Inc. are providing details resulting in our late filing of the following:

 

          ●    All 10-Q’s and the 10-K due since January 31, 2022

 

Ameri Metro, Inc. | 2575 Eastern Blvd, Suite 102, York PA 17402 | Ameri-Metro.com

Even though we have adequate books and records for all periods questioned in the opinion of management, we are unable to file financial statements nor footnotes for these periods due to the following:

 

          1.   A bogus lawsuit was filed before the financial periods in question by Andrew Lentz for more than $389,000,000. Mr.

                Lentz was a former consultant to a related entity of ARMT. Mr. Lentz was fully aware that this bogus lawsuit would

                cause significant damages to ARMT including, but not limited to, not being able to meet its financial reporting

                requirements. To date, his strategy has

                worked.

 

          2.   Andrew Lentz boasted to many ARMT affiliates about “blowing the whistle” on ARMT to the SEC. In fact, the SEC indeed

                accepted the Lentz TCR (complaint) and acted upon it by opening an investigation and issuing questionnaires to all but

                a few ARMT Stock Class B shareholders. Only an insider such as Andrew Lentz was privy to that very private

                information. ARMT is currently supporting a lawsuit against Lentz and the SEC on behalf of our Class B shareholders

                for violations of personal privacy, fraud and extortion. In that regard, Lentz was not in a position to file a lawsuit

                of this magnitude, notably having filed personal bankruptcy three times, thus

                fraudulent.

 

          3.   Even though Andrew Lentz clearly made materially false statements to a Federal agency (i.e. the SEC) causing serious

                damages to ARMT, the SEC has not pursued, to our knowledge, a criminal complaint against him via the Department of

                Justice. In fact, the SEC continues to pursue de-registration of ARMT regardless of

                merit.

 

          4.   The SEC has not issued its final position on accounting for digital currencies. The proposed SEC position remains in

                direct conflict with GAAP standards and the AICPA’s proposals. We agree with the AICPA’s position because the SEC’s

                position opens the door to massive financial statement

                manipulations.

 

If these matters remain outstanding and the SEC continues its course of action against ARMT, we have no choice but to do the following or any combination thereof to protect our interests:

 

          ●    File a complaint in Federal Court against the SEC and Andrew Lentz for numerous allegations involving damages of more

                than

                $1,000,000,000.

 

          ●    Immediately tokenize ARMT so that the company is no longer regulated by the SEC because the company will no longer have

                equity

                positions.

 

          ●    File our complaint against Andrew Lentz for consideration to the US Attorney’s office in Pennsylvania.

Very Truly,
