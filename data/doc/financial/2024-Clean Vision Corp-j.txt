CLEAN VISION CORPORATION

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements

March 31, 2024

 

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

 

Clean Vision Corporation (“Clean Vision,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a new entrant in the clean energy and waste-to-energy industries focused on clean technology and sustainability opportunities.  Currently, we are focused on providing a solution to the plastic and tire waste problem by recycling the waste and converting it into saleable byproducts, such as hydrogen and other clean-burning fuels that can be used to generate clean energy. Using a technology known as pyrolysis, which heats the feedstock (i.e., plastic) at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen so that the material does not burn, we are able to turn the feedstock into (i) low sulfur fuel, (ii) clean hydrogen and (iii) carbon black or char (char is created when plastic is used as feedstock). Our goal is to generate revenue from three sources: (i) service revenue from the recycling services we provide (ii) revenue generated from the sale of the byproducts; and (iii) revenue generated from the sale of fuel cell equipment.  Our mission is to aid in solving the problem of cost-effectively upcycling the vast amount of waste plastic generated on land before it flows into the world’s oceans.

 

All operations are currently being conducted through Clean-Seas, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Clean-Seas acquired its first pyrolysis unit in November 2021 for use in a pilot project in India, which began operations in early May 2022. On April 23, 2023, Clean-Seas completed its acquisition of a fifty-one percent (51%) interest in Ecosynergie, which changed its name to Clean-Seas Morocco, LLC on such date. Clean-Seas Morocco began operations at its pyrolysis facility in Agadir, Morocco, in April 2023, which currently has capacity to convert 20 TPD of waste plastic through pyrolysis.

 

We believe that our current projects will showcase our ability to pyrolyze waste plastic (using pyrolysis), which will generate three byproducts: (i) low sulfur fuel, (ii) clean hydrogen, AquaHtm, and (iii) char. We intend to sell the majority of the byproducts, while retaining a small amount of the low sulfur fuels and/or hydrogen to power our facilities and equipment. To date, our operations in India have not generated any revenue.

 

Clean-Seas India Private Limited was incorporated on November 17, 2021, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean-Seas.

 

Clean-Seas, Abu Dhabi PVT. LTD was incorporated in Abu Dhabi on December 9, 2021, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On January 19, 2022, the Company changed the name of its wholly owned subsidiary, Clean-Seas, Abu Dhabi PVT. LTD, to Clean-Seas Group. As of July 4, 2022, the Clean-Seas Group had ceased operations.

 

Endless Energy, Inc. (“Endless Energy”) was incorporated in Nevada on December 10, 2021, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. EndlessEnergy was incorporated for the purpose of investing in wind and solar energy projects but does not currently have any operations.

 

EcoCell, Inc. ("EcoCell”) was incorporated on March 4, 2022, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. EcoCell does not currently have any operations, but we intend to use EcoCell for the purpose of licensing fuel cell patented technology.

 

Clean-Seas Arizona, Inc. (“Clean-Seas Arizona”) was incorporated in Arizona on September 19, 2022, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean-Seas. Pursuant to that certain Memorandum of Understanding signed on November 4, 2022, Arizona State University (ASU) and the Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solution Services (WS3), the parties intend for Clean-Seas Arizona to establish a plastic feedstock to clean hydrogen conversion facility to be located in Phoenix, Arizona. In furtherance of these goals, and pursuant to a Services Agreement (the “Arizona Services Agreement”) signed on June 12, 2023, with ASU and WS3, this facility is currently intended to source and convert plastic feedstock from the Phoenix area and import plastic from California. Pursuant to the Arizona Services Agreement, the Arizona facility is expected to begin processing plastic feedstock in Q4 2024, now expected in Q4 2025, at 100 TPD and scale up to a maximum of 500 TPD at full capacity. Additionally, we are exploring plans for this facility to be powered by renewable energy, which, if successful, would become the first completely off grid pyrolysis conversion facility in the world.

Clean-Seas West Virginia, formed on April 1, 2023, is our first PCN facility slated for the United States and is currently expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2025. This facility will be located in the city of Belle, outside of Charleston, the capital of West Virginia, and is expected to begin operations converting 100 TPD of plastic feedstock. The Company expects to expand to greater than 500 TPD within three years of beginning operations. Clean-Seas has engaged MacVallee, LLC (“MacVallee”) to secure mixed plastic feedstock from material recovery facilities and industrial suppliers.

  

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the three month period ending March 31, 2024 and not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Concentrations of Credit Risk

 

We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently have not experienced any losses in our accounts. At times, such deposits may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable amount (“FDIC”).  As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no cash in excess of the FDIC’s $250,000 coverage limit.

 

Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2024, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Clean-Seas, Inc., Clean-Seas India Private Limited, Clean-Seas Group, Endless Energy, Inc., EcoCell, Inc., Clean-Seas Arizona, Inc., Clean-Seas West Virginia, and our 51% owned subsidiary, Clean-Seas Morocco, LLC. As of March 31, 2024, there was no activity in Clean-Seas Group, Endless Energy or Clean-Seas Arizona. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

 

Translation Adjustment

 

The accounts of the Company’s subsidiary Clean-Seas India are maintained in Rupees and the accounts of Clean-Seas Morocco in Moroccan dirham. In accordance with the Codification, all assets and liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate at respective balance sheets dates, members’ capital are translated at the historical rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance with the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Codification (ASC 220), as a component of members’ capital. Transaction gains and losses are reflected in the income statement.

Comprehensive Income

 

The Company uses SFAS 130 “Reporting Comprehensive Income” (ASC Topic 220).  Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of members’ capital, except those due to investments by members, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to members. Comprehensive income is included in net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments.

 

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share

 

Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. As of March 31, 2024, there are warrants to purchase up to 296,128,059 shares of common stock and approximately 131,000,000 dilutive shares of common stock from a convertible notes payable. As of March 31, 2023, there are warrants to purchase up to 55,214,850 shares of common stock and approximately 45,539,000 dilutive shares of common stock from a convertible note payable. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, there are 20,000,000 and 20,000,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock, respectively, if the Series C preferred stock were to be converted. There are 2,000,000 shares of Series B preferred stock outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock can automatically be converted on January 1, 2023, into shares of common stock at the rate of 10 shares of Common Stock for each share of Preferred Stock. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 allows companies to account for nonemployee awards in the same manner as employee awards. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019.

 

Goodwill

 

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.

 

In accordance with ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the Company will test for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments

 

The Company evaluates its convertible notes to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.

 

 F-9

 

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 

Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

 

Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

 

Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

 

The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.  The Company’s notes payable represents the fair value of such instruments as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.

 

The following table classifies the Company’s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of:

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

 

     ●    Identification of a contract with a customer;

     ●    Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;



     ●    Determination of the transaction price;

     ●    Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

     ●    Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.

 

 F-10

 

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Shipping and handling activities associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and recognized as revenue at the point in time at which control of the goods transfers to the customer. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.

 

Our business model is focused on generating revenue from the following sources:

 

(i) Service revenue from the recycling services we provide. We plan to establish plastic feedstock agreements with a number of feedstock suppliers for the delivery of plastic to our facilities. Much of this plastic is currently a cost center for such feedstock suppliers, who pay "tipping fees" to landfills or incinerators. We will accept this plastic feedstock at reduced price or for no tipping fees. In some cases, feedstock suppliers will also share in revenue on products produced from their feedstock.  This revenue will be realized and recognized upon receipt of feedstock at one of our facilities.

 

(ii) Revenue generated from the sale of commodities. We will produce commodities including, but not limited to, pyrolysis oil, fuel oil, lubricants, synthetic gas, hydrogen, and carbon char. We are in negotiation with chemical and oil companies for purchasing, or off-taking, fuels and oils we produce, and exploring applications for carbon char. This revenue will be recognized upon shipment of products from one of our facilities and in some cases off-takers may pre-pay for a contractual obligation to buy our commodities.

 

(iii) Revenue generated from the sale of environmental credits. Our products are eligible for numerous environmental credits, including but not limited to carbon credits, plastic credits, and biodiversity credits. These credits may be monetized directly on the relevant markets or may be realized as value-add to off-takers, who will pay a premium for eligible products. Revenue from these credits will be recognized upon sale of applicable environmental credits on recognized markets, and/or upon sale of commodities to off-takers when that off-take includes an environmental credit premium.

 

(iv) Revenue generated from royalties and/or the sale of equipment. We expect to develop or acquire intellectual property which could generate revenue through royalties and/or sales of manufactured equipment.  Revenue may be recognized upon the terms of a contracted sale agreement. 

 

For the period ended March 31, 2024, our operations in Morocco had generated approximately $50,000 in revenue. During the period, 93% of revenue was from one party. As of March 31, 2024, we did not generate revenue from any other sources.

 

Trade Accounts Receivable

 

Trade accounts receivable are amounts due from customers under normal trade terms. After assessing the creditworthiness of our customers and considering our historical experience, anticipated future operations, and prevailing economic conditions, we have determined that the application of the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology would be immaterial to our financial statements. Consequently, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of the year-end. The absence of a recorded allowance for credit losses reflects our judgment that potential credit losses on outstanding receivables are negligible. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 87% of accounts receivable are due from one customer.

 

 F-11

 

Inventory

 

Inventory consists of plastic bottles that are acquired at no cost and are held for use in our pyrolysis process, which converts these materials into pyrolysis oil, carbon char, and other commodities. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these bottles are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Since the acquisition cost of the bottles is zero, and there is no significant alternative market value attributable to these materials before conversion, the carrying value of this inventory is recorded at $0 on our consolidated balance sheets.

 

The absence of a recorded cost for the plastic bottles does not reflect their importance to our production process or potential value of the end products. This accounting treatment is specific to the characteristics of the materials used and does not imply any underlying concerns about the viability or value of the final products produced through our pyrolysis process. 

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has implemented all new applicable accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

 

NOTE 3 — GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs, had an accumulated deficit of $34,875,216 at March 31, 2024, and had a net loss of $2,200,960 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

 

Management plans to continue to implement its business plan and to fund operations by raising additional capital through the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company’s existence is dependent upon management's ability to implement its business plan and/or obtain additional funding. There can be no assurance that the Company’s financing efforts will result in profitable operations or the resolution of the Company's liquidity problems. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may include undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of equity financing.

 

NOTE 4 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

 

On April 25, 2023 (the “Morocco Closing Date”), Clean-Seas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its acquisition of a fifty-one percent (51%) interest (the “Morocco Acquisition”) in Eco Synergie S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized under the laws of Morocco (“Ecosynergie”), pursuant to that certain Notarial Deed (the “Morocco Purchase Agreement”) dated as of January 23, 2023 (the “Signing Date”) setting forth the terms and provisions applicable to the Morocco Acquisition (the “Purchase Agreement”). On the Morocco Closing Date, (i) Ecosynergie’s name was changed to Clean-Seas Morocco, LLC, (ii) Mrs. Halima Aboudeine and Mr. Daniel C. Harris, the Company’s CRO, were appointed as managers of Clean-Seas Morocco and (iii) Mr. Harris was appointed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Clean-Seas Morocco. Ecosynergie was not acquired from a related party and the Company did not have common control with Ecosynergie at the time of the Morocco Acquisition.

  

Pursuant to the Morocco Purchase Agreement, Clean-Seas paid an aggregate purchase price of $6,500,000 for the Morocco Acquisition, of which (i) $2,000,000 was paid on the Morocco Closing Date and (ii) the remaining $4,500,000 is to be paid to Ecosynergie Group over a period of ten (10) months from the Morocco Closing Date. Additionally, Clean-Seas committed to invest up to $50,000,000 in Clean-Seas Morocco over a period of ten (10) months from the Morocco Closing Date (the “Clean-Seas Morocco Investment”). The Clean-Seas Morocco Investment is currently contemplated to be funded in tranches based on a to be agreed to schedule tied to milestones related to the technology being deployed by Clean-Seas Morocco. The parties intend to complete the funding schedule applicable to the Clean-Seas Morocco investment in the first quarter 2025. To date, none of the Clean-Seas Morocco Investment has been funded.

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interest was allocated to goodwill. The provisional estimated fair value of the noncontrolling interest was based the minority interest (49%) in net assets as of the acquisition date. The goodwill of $4,854,622 represents expected synergies from the combined operations.

NOTE 5 — PROPERTY & EQUIPMENT

 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes purchases of property and equipment over $5,000. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows between three and five years.

 

Long lived assets, including property and equipment, to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less than their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

 

Maintenance and repair expenses, as incurred, are charged to expense. Betterments and renewals are capitalized in plant and equipment accounts. Cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to items replaced or retired are eliminated from the related accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included as income.

 

Clean-Seas, Inc. has purchased a pyrolysis unit for piloting and demonstration purposes which has been commissioned in Hyderabad, India as of May 2022. The unit will be used to showcase the Company’s technology and services, turning waste plastic into environmentally friendly commodities, to potential customers. 

 

Property, plant, and equipment at our Clean-Seas Morocco facility comprise equipment, buildings and fixtures, automobiles, furniture, and land. Upon acquisition, buildings and land were recorded at their estimated fair value, determined through a valuation conducted in 2018. Subsequently, these assets have been adjusted annually to reflect an approximate 5% increase in fair value, consistent with local real estate market trends. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, automobiles, and furniture is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 5 to 10 years. 

 

Property and equipment stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation consisted of the following:

The Company may prepay any portion of the outstanding principal amount and the guaranteed interest at any time and from time to time, without penalty or premium, provided that any such prepayment will be applied first to any unpaid collection costs, then to any unpaid fees, then to any unpaid Default Rate interest (as defined in the August Note), and any remaining amount shall be applied first to any unpaid guaranteed interest, and then to any unpaid principal amount.

 

The August Investor was granted a right of first refusal as the exclusive party with respect to any Equity Line of Credit transaction or financing (an “Additional Financing”) that the Company enters into during the 24-month period after the August Note Original Issue Date. In the event the Company enters into an Additional Financing, the Company must provide notice to the August Investor not less than 10 trading days in advance of the proposed entry. If the August Investor accepts all usual and customary terms set forth in the Additional Financing notice, the August Investor must, within 20 trading days of receipt of the notice, prepare all relevant documents in respect thereof for execution and delivery by the Company, provided, however, that the Company’s outside counsel must prepare the relevant registration statement to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 days after the Company receives the documents.

  

The August Note sets forth certain standard events of default (each such event, an “August Note Event of Default”), which, upon such August Note Event of Default, the principal amount and the guaranteed interest then outstanding under the August Note becomes convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to a notice provided by the August Investor to the Company. At any time after the occurrence of an August Note Event of Default, the outstanding principal amount and the outstanding guaranteed interest then outstanding on the August Note, plus accrued but unpaid Default Rate (as defined in the August Note) interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become immediately due and payable at the August Investor’s option, in cash or in shares of the Company’s common stock at 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the August Note and accrued and unpaid interest, plus other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of the August Note.

October 2023 Note - GS Capital Partners

 

On October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “October Purchase Agreement”) with an accredited investor (the “October Investor”) related to the Company’s sale of two 12% convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $660,000 (each note being in the amount of $330,000 and containing an original issue discount of $30,000 such that the purchase price of each note is $300,000) (each “Note,” and together the “Notes”) are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, upon the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in each Note. The Company issued and sold the first Note (the “First Note”) on October 26, 2023 (the “First Closing Date” or the “First Issuance Date”). The closing for the second Note (the “Second Note”) is to occur approximately 30-60 days following the First Closing Date (the “Second Closing Date,” and together with the First Closing Date, the “Closing Date”).

 

On the First Closing Date, the Company issued 800,000 restricted shares of Common Stock to the Purchaser as additional consideration for the purchase of the First Note (the “First Note Commitment Shares”). Upon the closing of the Second Note, the Company will issue additional commitment shares in an amount calculated based on the price per share of the Common Stock at the time of funding of such Second Note (the “Second Note Commitment Shares,” and together with the First Note Commitment Shares, the “Commitment Shares”). In addition to the Commitment Shares, the Company agreed to issue 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock to the Purchaser (the “Returnable Shares”) for each Note. Each issuance of Returnable Shares is subject to recalculation based on the price per share of Common Stock at the time of funding for each Note, such that the economic value of each set of Returnable Shares shall be equal to the value of the initial set of Returnable Shares. For example, if on the Second Closing Date, the closing price of the Common Stock is 50% of the closing price of the Common Stock on the First Closing Date, the Company will be required to issue 15,000,000 Returnable Shares on the Second Note Closing Date. The Returnable Shares must be returned to the Company unless each Note enters into an uncured default during its term, or the Company is otherwise unable to repay each Note on or prior to maturity.

In addition, the Company agreed to issue 3,100,000 shares of restricted Common Stock (the “Commitment Shares”) to ClearThink as additional consideration for the First Note Tranche and as an inducement for the Investor to enter into the STRATA Agreement; provided, however, that 2,500,000 shares of Commitment Shares will be returned to the Company if the Company, at its option, does not consummate the transactions contemplated by the STRATA Agreement by not filing the Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of all securities issuable under each of the ClearThink Agreements (the “Resale Registration Statement”).

  

The First Note Tranche was issued on February 12, 2024 and the Second Note Tranche shall be issued within three (3) days after the Company’s filing of the Resale Registration Statement.

 

While any of the securities issued or issuable under the SPA are outstanding, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any security, or amendment to a security that was originally issued before the SPA Closing Date, with any term that the Investor reasonably believes is more favorable to the Investor of such security or with a term in favor of the Investor of such security that the Investor reasonably believes was not similarly provided to ClearThink in the ClearThink Note, (i) the Company shall notify the Investor of such additional or more favorable term within one (1) business day of the issuance and/or amendment (as applicable) of the respective security, and (i) such term, at Investor's option, shall become a part of the transaction documents with the Investor (regardless of whether the Company complied with the notification provision herein). The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the Investor of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing prepayment rate, interest rates, and original issue discounts, conversion or exercise prices warrant coverage and pricing, commitment shares and similar terms and conditions.

Unless the Investor elects to convert the Note into shares of Common Stock, Principal payments shall be made in four installments, each in the amount of $50,000 commencing on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day anniversary following the SPA Closing Date and continuing thereafter each thirty (30) days for four (4) months thereafter. The ClearThink Note may be prepaid in whole or in part as set forth therein and any amount of Principal or Interest on the ClearThink Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of the lesser of (i) twenty four percent (24%) per annum (which shall be guaranteed and applied to the balance due under the ClearThink Note upon an Event of Default (as defined in the ClearThink Note)) and (ii) the maximum amount permitted under law from the due date thereof until the same is paid.

NOTE 10 — PREFERRED STOCK

 

The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock at $0.001 par value per share with the following designations.

 

Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock

 

On September 21, 2020, the Company created a series of Preferred Stock designating 2,000,000 shares as Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s Common Stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock does not bear a dividend or have voting rights and is not convertible into shares of our Common Stock.

 

Series B Preferred Stock

 

On December 14, 2020, the Company designated 2,000,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series B Convertible, Non-voting Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). The Series B Preferred Stock does not bear a dividend or have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of common stock on January 1, 2023, at the rate of 10 shares of common stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock; however, due to an ongoing dispute with certain holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, which is expected to be resolved through binding arbitration in December 2023, such conversion has not been effectuated as of the date hereof. Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have anti-dilution rights protecting their interests in the Company from the issuance of any additional shares of capital stock for a two year period following conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock calculated at the rate of 20% on a fully diluted basis.

NOTE 12 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Project Finance Arrangement

 

On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the “Agreement”) with Edge Management, LLC (“Edge”), a services firm based in New York City. Under the Agreement, Edge will assist us to develop, structure and implement project finance strategies (“Project Finance”) for our clean energy installations around the world. Financing strategies will be in amounts and upon terms acceptable to us, and may include, without limitation, common and preferred equity financing, mezzanine and other junior debt financing, and/or senior debt financing, including but not limited to one or more bond offerings (“Project Financing(s)”). Under the Agreement, Edge is engaged as our exclusive representative for Project Financing matters. Edge is entitled to receive a cash payment for any Project Financing involving as follows: 5% of the gross amount of the funding facilities (up to $500 million) of all forms approved by the lender (“Lender”) introduced by Edge and or its affiliates and accepted by the Company on closing (“Closing”), 4% of the gross amount of the funding facilities (for the tranche of funding ranging from $500,000,001 to $1,000,000,000) approved by the Lender introduced by Edge and or its affiliates and accepted by the Company on Closing, and 3% of the subsequent gross amount ($1,000,000,001 and greater) of the funding facilities of all forms approved by the Lender introduced by Edge and/or its affiliates and accepted by the Company on Closing. In addition to the cash consulting fee, Edge shall be issued cashless, five-year warrants equal to: 2% (at a strike price to be mutually determined by the Parties for the first tranche of funding, up to $500 million), 1% (at a strike price to be mutually determined by the Parties for the tranche of funding ranging from $500,000,001 to $1,000,000,000), and 1% (at a strike price to be mutually determined by the Parties for any and all subsequent Debt Funding ($1,000,000,001 and greater)) of the outstanding common and preferred shares, warrants, options, and other forms of participation in the our Company on Closing.. The Agreement has an initial term of one (1) year and is cancellable by either party on ninety (90) days written notice. There is no guarantee that Edge will be successful in helping us obtain Project Financing.

 

Legal Proceedings

 

On January 30, 2023, Leonard Tucker, LLC (“Tucker”), one of the holders of the Company’s Series B Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) filed an action against the Company (the “Tucker Litigation”) in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (Case No. CV23-00188) alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, specific performance and declaratory relief (the “Tucker Complaint”). The Tucker Litigation arose from the 3-year Consulting Agreement the Company entered into with Tucker on December 17, 2020 (the “Tucker Agreement”), whereby Tucker agreed to perform certain strategic and business development services to the Company in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and a consulting fee of $20,000 per month. The 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock automatically converted into 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) on January 1, 2023. 

 

The Company’s Transfer Agent was instructed to not issue the shares of Common Stock because of the ongoing dispute between the Company and Tucker regarding Tucker’s ability to perform under the Tucker Agreement due to, among other things, the action filed by the SEC against Profile Solutions, Inc., Dan Oran and Tucker on September 9, 2022 in the United States District Court Southern District of Florida (Case No. 1:22-cv-22881) alleging, among other things, that Tucker violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10-b5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Tucker is seeking, among other things, that the Company issue the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Tucker Agreement. The Company is contesting all of the allegations set forth in the Tucker Complaint. On February 24, 2023, the Company removed the Tucker Litigation to the United States District of Nevada (Case No. 2:23-cv-00296). 

 F-23

 

 

On February 27, 2023, the Company filed counterclaims against Tucker and its principal, Leonard Tucker (the “Company Complaint”), wherein the Company sought a judgment against Tucker declaring the Tucker Agreement unenforceable and invalid, as well as damages related to its claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and breach of duty against both Tucker and its principal. On March 10, 2023, the parties subsequently stipulated to stay the Tucker Litigation to attend binding arbitration. On January 31, 2024, the arbitrator entered an interim award in favor of the Company related to a discovery dispute in the arbitration for the sum of $19,625.00. 

 

On January 25, 2024, the arbitrator entered her decision (the “Decision”) regarding the parties relative liability in the Tucker Litigation. Overall, the Decision concluded that the Company substantially prevailed on its claims, counterclaims, and defenses in the Tucker Litigation. First, the Decision concluded that the Company prevailed on its claim that the Tucker Agreement is invalid and unenforceable; and further concluded that the Company prevailed against Tucker on each of Tucker’s causes of action based on the Tucker Agreement, including Tucker’s claims for breach of contract, breach of the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, specific performance, and declaratory relief. Second, the Decision concluded no fraud or breach of duty with respect to Tucker and its principal; and further concluded that Tucker may be entitled to retain the compensation paid by the Company for its services under an unjust enrichment theory, in an amount to be determined.  Based on the forgoing Decision, the arbitrator ordered the parties to the Tucker Litigation to submit supplementary briefing regarding their respective available remedies.

 

On April 15, 2024, the arbitrator heard the parties arguments on the supplementary briefing regarding remedies and ruled (i) 100% of the shares issued to Tucker as compensation under the Tucker Agreement be cancelled as a result of the Tucker Agreement being invalid and unenforceable and (ii) Tucker was entitled to unjust enrichment damages in an amount equal to the monthly fee under the Tucker Agreement for the period of engagement until the Company retained a licensed broker dealer to replace the services being performed under the Tucker Agreement.

 

As a result of the arbitrator’s decision with respect to remedies, the Company paid Tucker the amount of $375, calculated as $20,000 fee owed to Tucker, minus the $19,625 awarded to the Company.

Company Overview and Description of Business

 

Overview

 

Clean Vision is a new entrant in the clean energy and waste-to-value industries focused on clean technology and sustainability opportunities. By leveraging innovative technology, we aim to responsibly resolve environmental challenges by producing valuable products. Currently, we are focused on providing a solution to the plastic waste problem by converting the waste (feedstock) into saleable byproducts, such as precursors for new plastic products, hydrogen and other clean-burning fuels that can be used to generate clean energy. Using a technology known as pyrolysis, which heats the feedstock (i.e., plastic) at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, so that the material does not burn, we are able to convert the feedstock into (i) clean fuels i.e. plastic pyrolysis oil, (ii) clean hydrogen (specifically, the Company’s branded clean hydrogen, AquaH®, which trademark was issued by the USPTO on November 8, 2023 and published on November 28, 2023), and (iii) carbon char. We intend to generate revenue from the following sources: (i) service revenue from the recycling services we provide; (ii) revenue generated from the sale of commodities; (iii) revenue generated from the sale of environmental credits; and (iv) revenue generated from the sale of equipment. Our mission is to aid in solving the problem of cost-effectively upcycling the vast amount of plastic feedstock generated on land before it flows into the world’s oceans.

 

According to analysis and projections reported by the EIA on June 14, 2023, it is estimated that while annual demand growth is expected to drop from 2.4 million barrels per day (“mb/d”) due to a shift in focus to a clean energy economy, global oil demand will rise by 6% from 2022 to 2028, reaching 105.7 mb/d. The EIA also estimates that upstream investments in oil and gas exploration, extraction and production were on course to reach their highest levels since 2015, growing 11% year-on-year to $528 billion in 2023.

 

Additionally, as stated in the Hydrogen Generation Market Research published by Allied Market Research in September 2022, the global hydrogen generation market size was valued at $136.3 billion in 2021 and is expected to each $262 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2022 to 2031. The Hydrogen Generation Market Research explains that hydrogen plays a vital role in the chemicals and oil & gas industry, with major factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth mostly due to ongoing unprecedented revolutions under the net zero emissions scenario, where global output of hydrogen is expected to reach 200 metric tons in 2030 when it is estimated that around 70% of hydrogen production will be done through low carbon technologies. It is anticipated that by 2050, the production of hydrogen will increase to roughly 500 metric tons and that energy efficiency, electrification, renewable energy, hydrogen and hydrogen based fuels, and carbon, capture, utilization and storage are some of the major technology pillars to decarbonize the world energy system.

 

According to the research and analysis by Argonne published in the Journal of Cleaner Production on November 1, 2023, plastics are important products for the modern economy, reaching production of 367 and 56 million tons in the world and North America, respectively, in 2022. The Argonne research also states that as of November 2023, the plastic industry relied heavily on fossil resources with data suggesting that 6% of the global production of crude oil and natural gas liquids is devoted to the production of plastics and is expected to increase to 20% in 2050, resulting in higher waste generation. According to Argonne, while recycling could reduce reliance on fossil resources and waste generation in the plastic industry while converting post-use plastic into a resource, only 9% of the post-use plastic collected in the United States is mechanically recycled due to diverse economic, technical environmental and regulatory barriers.

 25

 

 

Further, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has suggested that global plastics use is projected to almost triple between 2019 and 2060, with estimates of an increase from 460 million tons to 1,231 million tons yearly.

 

We believe that in the near future, a significant growth sector of the economy will be in clean energy and sustainable products and services. This belief was a key factor in our shift in our business focus in May 2020 and our acquisition of Clean-Seas, Inc. (“Clean-Seas”), which became our wholly owned subsidiary on May 19, 2020. We believe that Clean-Seas has made significant progress in identifying and developing its business model around the clean energy and waste-to-value sectors.

 

Clean Vision was established in 2017 as a company focused on the acquisition of disruptive technologies that will impact the digital economy. The Company, which was formerly known as Byzen Digital Inc., changed its corporate name to Clean Vision on March 12, 2021.

  

All operations are currently being conducted through Clean-Seas. Clean-Seas acquired its first pyrolysis unit in November 2021 for use in a pilot project in India, which began operations in early May 2022. On April 23, 2023, Clean-Seas completed its acquisition of a fifty-one percent (51%) interest in Ecosynergie, which changed its name to Clean-Seas Morocco, LLC on such date. Clean-Seas Morocco began operations at its pyrolysis facility in Agadir, Morocco, in April 2023, which currently has capacity to convert 20 TPD of waste plastic through pyrolysis

Results of Operations

 

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) includes a discussion of the consolidated results from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024

 

Revenue

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $49,692 and $0, respectively from our subsidiary Clean-Seas Morocco. Revenue from operations is generated from the processing of plastic waste material ("feedstock") at our plant in Agadir, Morocco. The plastic feedstock is put through a pyrolysis system which applies pressure and heat, in the absence of oxygen (no incineration), converting the plastic back to its petroleum form. The revenue was generated from selling the output product, "pyrolysis oil," to a local oil and gas wholesaler in Morocco, called the "off-taker". We receive the plastic feedstock in Agadir at $0 cost, but variable expenses include labor, land lease, and overhead such as insurance.  

  

Consulting Expense

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we had consulting expenses of $384,232 and $543,725, respectively, a decrease of $159,493 or 29.3%. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in stock compensation expense. In the current year we issued stock for services for non-cash compensation expense of approximately $74,000 compared to approximately $388,000 of stock compensation expense for preferred shares in the prior period.

 

Professional Fees

 

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred professional fees of $401,905 and $415,746, respectively, a decrease of $13,841 or 3.3%. Our professional fees consist primarily of legal and audit fees.

Going Concern

 

The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of $11,085,261, an accumulated deficit of $34,875,216 and net loss of $2,161,032. The Company has not yet established a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating and has incurred net losses since inception. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock and/or debt financing is unknown.

 

The Company believes that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements for the next twelve months since the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

Management plans to continue to implement its business plan and to fund operations by raising additional capital through the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company’s existence is dependent upon management's ability to implement its business plan and/or obtain additional funding. There can be no assurance that the Company’s financing efforts will result in profitable operations or the resolution of the Company's liquidity problems. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may include undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of equity financing. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve-month period since the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment in its securities.

 

Capital Raising Transactions

We generated net proceeds of $1,176,500 from the issuance of convertible notes during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

Other outstanding obligations at March 31, 2024

The Company had convertible promissory notes aggregating $5,486,553 outstanding at March 31, 2024. The accrued interest amounted to approximately $334,000 as of March 31, 2024. The convertible notes payable bear interest at rates ranging between 5% and 12% per annum. At March 31, 2024, none of the convertible promissory notes have matured and are in default.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, using the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

Presently, except as descried below, there are not any material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it.

 

On January 30, 2023, Leonard Tucker, LLC (“Tucker”), one of the holders of the Company’s Series B Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) filed an action against the Company (the “Tucker Litigation”) in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (Case No. CV23-00188) alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, specific performance and declaratory relief (the “Tucker Complaint”). The Tucker Litigation arose from the 3-year Consulting Agreement the Company entered into with Tucker on December 17, 2020 (the “Tucker Agreement”), whereby Tucker agreed to perform certain strategic and business development services to the Company in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and a consulting fee of $20,000 per month. The 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock automatically converted into 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) on January 31, 2023. 

 

The Company’s Transfer Agent was instructed to not issue the shares of Common Stock because of the ongoing dispute between the Company and Tucker regarding Tucker’s ability to perform under the Tucker Agreement due to, among other things, the action filed by the SEC against Profile Solutions, Inc., Dan Oran and Tucker on September 9, 2022 in the United States District Court Southern District of Florida (Case No. 1:22-cv-22881) alleging, among other things, that Tucker violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10-b5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Tucker is seeking, among other things, that the Company issue the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Tucker Agreement. The Company is contesting all of the allegations set forth in the Tucker Complaint. On February 24, 2023, the Company removed the Tucker Litigation to the United States District of Nevada (Case No. 2:23-cv-00296). 

 

On February 27, 2023, the Company filed counterclaims against Tucker and its principal, Leonard Tucker (the “Company Complaint”), wherein the Company sought a judgment against Tucker declaring the Tucker Agreement unenforceable and invalid, as well as damages related to its claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and breach of duty against both Tucker and its principal. On March 10, 2023, the parties subsequently stipulated to stay the Tucker Litigation to attend binding arbitration. On January 31, 2024, the arbitrator entered an interim award in favor of the Company related to a discovery dispute in the arbitration for the sum of $19,625. 

 

On January 25, 2024, the arbitrator entered her decision (the “Decision”) regarding the parties relative liability in the Tucker Litigation. Overall, the Decision concluded that the Company substantially prevailed on its claims, counterclaims, and defenses in the Tucker Litigation. First, the Decision concluded that the Company prevailed on its claim that the Tucker Agreement is invalid and unenforceable; and further concluded that the Company prevailed against Tucker on each of Tucker’s causes of action based on the Tucker Agreement, including Tucker’s claims for breach of contract, breach of the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, specific performance, and declaratory relief. Second, the Decision concluded no fraud or breach of duty with respect to Tucker and its principal; and further concluded that Tucker may be entitled to retain the compensation paid by the Company for its services under an unjust enrichment theory, in an amount to be determined.  Based on the forgoing Decision, the arbitrator ordered the parties to the Tucker Litigation to submit supplementary briefing regarding their respective available remedies.

 

On April 15, 2024, the arbitrator heard the parties arguments on the supplementary briefing regarding remedies and ruled (i) 100% of the shares issued to Tucker as compensation under the Tucker Agreement be cancelled as a result of the Tucker Agreement being invalid and unenforceable and (ii) Tucker was entitled to unjust enrichment damages in an amount equal to the monthly fee under the Tucker Agreement for the period of engagement until the Company retained a licensed broker dealer to replace the services being performed under the Tucker Agreement.

 

 30

 

As a result of the arbitrator’s decision with respect to remedies, on January 1, 2024 the Company paid Tucker the amount of $375, calculated as $20,000 fee owed to Tucker, minus the $19,625 awarded to the Company.
