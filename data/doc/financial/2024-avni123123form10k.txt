Overview

Arvana was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as “Turinco, Inc.” to engage in any legal undertaking. On July 24, 2006, Arvana changed its name from Turinco, Inc. to Arvana Inc. on the acquisition of Arvana Networks, Inc., a telecommunications business. We discontinued efforts related to that business as of December 31, 2009. Arvana acquired Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC on February 3, 2023. Down2Fish was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on April 1, 2019.

Arvana acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Down2Fish on February 3, 2023, from LCF Salons, LLC, (“LCF”) in exchange for fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and a secured promissory note (“Note”) in the amount of seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000) payable twenty-four (24) months after the closing date that bears interest of seven and one quarter percent (7¼%) per annum. Interest on the promissory note is payable on an annual basis. On January 29, 2024, Arvana and LCF agreed to extend the interest due date on the Note from the annual anniversary to April 3, 2024.

Stockholders approved a forward stock split of Arvana’s common shares on a 3-for-1 basis effected on April 19, 2023, to stockholders of record on March 31, 2023. All changes in Arvana’s capital structure have been given retroactive effect in this annual report.

While Arvana operates its fishing charter business it has continued to seek business opportunities in real estate development. On December 12, 2023, Arvana announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the business of FirstShot Centers, LLC (“FirstShot”), a Nevada based company intent on expanding its specialty use concept to acquire and repurpose vacant shopping malls, outlet locations and big bog stores throughout the United States to attract new tenants from targeted industries that offer goods or services that are not available online. The parties are yet to enter into a definitive agreement pending delivery of the FirstShot business and financing plan.

History

Down2Fish operates a Florida based fishing charter business that offers a range of curated maritime adventures that include inshore, offshore, and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services.

Services

Down2Fish offers the following service options for seaborne adventures:

 •    inshore/coastal fishing boat charter services;



 •    offshore fishing boat charter services.



 •    sight-seeing fishing boat charter services; and



 •    custom fishing boat chart services.

In-shore fishing charters are an excellent way to experience deep-sea fishing off the Florida Gulf coast without spending the day motoring out to the open sea and back again. Customers get the full experience of baiting their line, casting, hooking, and landing a real live Gulf water fish, all within sight of shore. We offer in-shore charters as full or half-day adventures that includes exploring flats and bays up to three miles from the beach. May, June, and July are the best months for inshore fishing in the Tampa Bay area. Popular inshore fish species include mangrove snapper, snook, redfish, tarpon, and cobia. Fishing lessons are included on our charters along with help in cleaning the catch.

An offshore deep-sea fishing charter is designed to be an immersive experience. Charters are all-day trips that travel up to eighty miles offshore to open waters off the Florida Gulf coast, that are home to large fish, up to 50lbs or more including red grouper, scamp grouper, gag grouper, mahi mahi, American red snapper, red porgy, greater amberjack, blackfin tuna, various shark species, king mackerel, jack crevalle, and cobia. The skills required for deep-sea fishing can be more challenging than that required for in-shore fishing and the equipment more exhaustive to use. Fishing lessons for inexperienced deep-sea anglers are often a good part of the charter. We offer deep-sea fishing all year round subject to weather conditions. 

Sight-seeing charters specialize in taking customers out on local waterways on guided tours of aquatic and terrestrial points of interest. This type of charter works well in tourist destinations such as Tampa. 

Custom or special event charters are all-day trips designed to commemorate special events such as weddings, corporate outings, or birthday parties that can combine in-shore and off-shore fishing charters. Customers can choose from a variety of activities and sight-seeing options tailored to specific requests. 

                                                                   2                                                                    

 

We intend to offer dolphin watching charters as the means to grow the Down2Fish brand in the Greater Tampa area and are exploring the possibilities for offering whale watching charters. The Tampa Bay area is ideal for dolphin spotting as many dolphins live in shallow waters close to the coastline. Dolphin tours are popular with families and groups. However, Down2Fish will need a larger vessel that can carry more clients to initiate dolphin watching charters. North Atlantic right whales can be sporadically spotted from November to April calving in waters off the Florida Gulf coast. Given that right whale spotting in Florida is a rarity, we are unaware of any fishing charter companies in Florida that offer whale watching tours so to offer this service could quickly help us distinguish the Down2Fish brand.

Industry

The fishing charter industry consists of businesses that engage in services such as inshore/coastal fishing, offshore fishing, and tournament fishing. Operators provide charter boat services for individuals, parties, and companies. Operators may vary greatly in size, ranging from large operators with a fleet of vessels to single boat owner-operators and part-time charter companies. The industry has seen faltering growth over the past five years. COVID-19 was the primary disruption that resulted in a significant decline in domestic tourism.

The IBISWorld report dated to September 2023, explains that the fishing charter industry has experienced a moderate decline over the last five years. Overall revenue was estimated to drop at an annualized rate of 4.8% through that period to $440.3 million. Despite the fall in revenue, the IBISWorld report added that the number of charter boat businesses grew by 2.4% to 3,649, and the number of charter boat employees grew by 1.4% to 5,753 during the prior five years to September 2023. While the fishing charter industry benefited from a recovering economy in 2021 post pandemic, rising inflation in 2022, dampened growth through 2023. The reports notes that the fishing charter industry continues to face stiff competition from other recreational activities such as hiking, running, and video games along with a negative shift in consumer confidence. Inflation has caused consumers to save more of their earnings in response economic uncertainty which sentiment has had a chilling effect on the demand for fishing charter boat services. 

Looking ahead, the IBISWorld report for the fishing charter business has forecast an increase in revenue at an annualized rate of 3.0% to $511.3 over the next five years as disposable income is expected to increase in a tight labor market, which development will likely provide consumers with more discretionary income for recreational services such as fishing charters.

Competition

While no single participant in the fishing charter business holds a dominant share of the available market, we do nonetheless face intense competition. Competitors range from industry operators that maintain fleets of vessels, to single vessel owner-operators and part-time charter companies. Existing and prospective competitors have or could have advantages over us such as those with greater name recognition, longer operating histories, deeper service offerings, larger customer bases, substantially greater financial or other resources. Many of our competitors offer fishing charters at a low-cost that may be difficult or impossible for us to match and are able to book fishing charters directly from their own e-commerce websites as compared to our reliance on third-party booking sites or services to accept payment, all of which are paid a fee for each engagement.

                                                                   3                                                                    

 

We are faced with a bevy of competitors in the Tampa Bay area that include:

   • Queen Fleet Deep Sea Fishing based in Clearwater, Florida, a family-owned business that has offered fishing charters for over

      sixty years. Service offerings include charters for up to 150 persons on “fishing party boats” for half day excursions, and on

      smaller charters for up to 85 persons on all day fishing excursions. The business maintains two of the larger fishing party

      boats and one vessel for all day fishing

      charters.



   • Poseidon Fishing Charters that operate from Tampa Bay offers specific charters to fish for specific fish species, such as goliath

      grouper fishing or shark fishing, night fishing and firework sight-seeing tours. Poseidon Fishing also offers a summer camp for

      children, merchandise, and special pricing for time sensitive

      charters.



   • Florida Reels Fishing Charters offers a variety of pick-up locations along the Gulf Coast that is operated by a single

      owner-operator with one custom built vessel. The business emphasizes its use of top fishing equipment and reliance on

      knowledge-based fishing derived from years spent fishing in the

      area.

While this list of competitors is in no way exhaustive it does provide a snapshot of competition in the area and some of the distinguishing characteristics used by these competitors to attract fishing charters.

Our competitive weaknesses are tied to our limited operating history and the size of our operation. Since we are relatively new to operating in the Tampa Bay area, our business struggles with brand recognition in a market filled with options. We expect that the implementation of our business plan will increase brand recognition and customers for our fishing charters. However, efforts to expand brand recognition require that we overcome our biggest competitive weakness that being the limited financial resources at our disposal. Material growth will depend, in no small part on our ability to purchase an additional vessel to host dolphin sightseeing charters, and our willingness to spend additional sums on marketing our charters. We do not presently have the funds necessary to purchase a suitable dolphin sightseeing vessel, or to boost marketing efforts.

Despite the nature of the fishing charter industry and our competitive weaknesses, we believe that the services we offer today will continue to compete effectively due to several factors. We have a team with excellent experience in the fishing charter industry that provides the core strength of our workforce. Aside from the synergies that exist in our carefully selected workforce, our charters are guided by best practices in the industry. Our captain is at the top of the range for expertise in running fishing charters. Another of our strengths is our location in Palmetto, Florida with easy access to the Florida Gulf Coast, an area extremely popular for anglers and tourists alike. The state-of-art condition of our fishing boats and fishing equipment is an attraction for customers. Another of our strengths is our attention to fishing rules and regulations focused on preserving the environment. Our concern for the environment is not lost on customers who are increasingly focused on enjoying nature without causing harm in the process. We are also cost competitive with other fishing charter businesses in the area.

Market Analysis

The fishing charter industry competes with a wide variety of other recreational activities that include non-fishing sightseeing, land-based recreation such as hiking, city sightseeing, and even sporting events. A research report published by IBISWorld in 2018 reported that during the five years that preceded that year, the industry lost ground to other forms of recreation as consumer preferences changed. The COVID-19 pandemic had a further chilling effect on the industry as prospective customers were bound to remain in their homes. However, a post-COVID-19 IBISWorld report on the fishing charter industry released in September of 2023 forecasts that the industry is expected to realize annualized revenue growth through 2028, on the basis that sustained economic growth will lead to an increase in consumer incomes which will enable more people to spend more money on recreational activities. Despite the effects of inflation, there is reason to believe that the fishing charter industry is about to enter a consistent growth pattern in the face of competing recreational activities.

Marketing Strategy

Our marketing strategies are directed towards achieving specific objectives that support our strategic goals to create new market channels, increase revenue and grow market share. We expect to leverage off premier fishing charter experiences to win new customers and retain existing ones. Down2Fish maintains modern well equipped fishing charter vessels, experienced crews, a convenient location from which to embark on charters, and reliance on highly reliable payment platforms for payment. Our intention is also to work with brand and publicity consultants to help us map out publicity and advertising strategies that will help us reach our target market.

We expect to continue to make use of the following marketing and sales strategies:

 •    promote our business online via our official website and social media platforms like; Instagram, Facebook, twitter, YouTube,

       Google, LinkedIn + et

       al;



 •    offer Down2Fish branded merchandise online and aboard our fishing charters;



 •    advertise special prices;



 •    advertise our fishing boat charter in our official website and employ strategies that will help us pull traffic to the site;



 •    promote our business on fishing charter booking sites such as Fareharbor, Travelocity, and Fishing Booker; and



 •    dress crew members in branded shirts with our company logo.

Our pricing is similar to the average price of what is charged for a fishing charter. While we do not charge more than our competitors, we do not charge less. Nonetheless, we do intend to offer discounts on our fishing charters for special events, and to reward loyal customers especially for referrals to our business.

Our facility to accept payments is all inclusive, as we are quite aware that different customers prefer different payment options such as:

 •    payment via bank transfer



 •    payment with cash



 •    payment via Point-of-Sale Machine (POS)



 •    payment via credit card.

Governmental Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations in Florida.

The captain of a saltwater fishing charter must comply with U.S. Coast Guard (“USGC”) regulations which include holding a USGC Captain’s License. Vessels used by a charter captain to do business must be commercially registered or have a USGC certificate of documentation with a commercial designation and follow USGC vessel safety requirements. Vessels carrying more than six passengers for hire must also have a Certificate of Inspection issued by the USGC. The USGC also exercises full authority over the safety and health of crews aboard vessels that have been inspected and certified. Any safety or health complaints received by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) concerning crew working conditions on an inspected vessel are referred to the USGC for determination of whether the events complained of constitute hazardous conditions. Fishing charters conducted in the Gulf of Mexico are also required to hold Gulf of Mexico Charter/Headboat for Reef Fish, and a Gulf of Mexico Charter/Headboat for Coastal Migratory Pelagics permits issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). Enforcement falls on the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement.

                                                                   5                                                                    

 

Florida requires a Charter Captain or Boat Fishing License to carry paying customers for the purpose of taking, attempting to take or possessing saltwater fish or organisms. A Florida Charter Capitan license also covers customers on a charter who are not required to hold separate recreational saltwater fishing licenses and permit the licensed captain to go from boat to boat to do business. Florida also requires us to hold a Gulf Reef Fish Charter/Endorsement. State licenses are issued by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (“FWC”). Our business is also subject to FWC Florida Charter for Hire Regulations and Florida Recreational Fishing Regulations. We are further required to register as our boats as commercial vessels with the Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Our business must also follow certain local restrictions as to seasons, volume, and fish species subject to catch.

We are also subject to city and county business license requirements.

Our failure to comply with the rules and regulations that govern fishing charter businesses could result in substantial penalties. Since such rules and regulations are frequently amended or interpreted differently by regulatory agencies, we are unable to accurately predict the future cost or impact on our business in complying with such laws or ultimately what cost or impact compliance or otherwise will have on us. Nevertheless, we do believe that our business is currently in regulatory compliance with those rules and regulations incumbent upon us.

Environment

We seek to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutory laws or regulations concerning the preservation of our environment. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (“MSA”) is the primary federal law governing marine fisheries management in federal waters up to two hundred nautical miles off the U.S. coasts. The MSA works through local councils to maintain its objectives. Our business falls under the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, one of eight councils that are responsible for developing management plans to prevent overfishing, rebuild fish stocks and promote the long-term health of fishing. MSA councils look to the Scientific and Statistical Committee (“SSC”) for advice over a range management issues, such as what is an acceptable biological catch, maximum sustainability, and rebuilding targets. Based on data generated by the SSC, each council develops a fish management plan and submits recommended regulations to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management will also work with the FWC to ensure consistency in catch limitations. NOAA is one of the agencies responsible the enforcement of MSA directives.

Florida is fiercely protective of its fish stocks given the tremendous economic impact it has on the state. On the state level the FWC is responsible for saltwater regulations that extend up to nine nautical miles off the Florida Gulf Coast. Regulations published through the FWC go to bag limits, species, size, and season for each fish species that can be legally caught. The FWC also publishes a list of fish species that cannot be caught. Since restrictions are subject to change, current restrictions are published online on the FWC’s website, eRegulations.com, and through independent businesses that offer fishing charters. Local fishing areas may also maintain restrictions on fishing that apply to their communities.

Expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our business.

                                                                   6                                                                    

 

Employees

Arvana has one employee who serves as its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and a director.

Down2Fish has a non-employee compensation arrangement with its manager and plans to hire additional persons moving forward to increase the number of fishing charters tours undertaken.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Arvana is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

Arvana is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY

Limited Risk Management Strategy for Handling Sensitive Data

Arvana is committed to the integrity and security of the sensitive data that it collects, maintains, and transmits across its computer systems. Over the ordinary course of our business, Arvana and its third-party service providers, such as charter booking services, collect, maintain, and transmit sensitive data including proprietary or confidential business information (such as operational data and personal information). The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation.

Despite our efforts to implement robust security measures, in reliance on administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, our risk management strategies, and practices for protecting sensitive data are subject to certain limitations. A variety of factors give rise to these limitations including the evolving nature of cyber threats, resource constraints, and the inherent risks associated with the technologies we and third-party service providers employ. Arvana relies on third parties, including cloud vendors and consultants, for various business functions. Many of our third-party service providers have access to our information systems and data, and we rely on such third parties for the operation of our business. We oversee third-party service providers by conducting vendor diligence. Vendors are generally assessed for risk based on the nature of their service, access to data and systems and supply chain risk.

                                                                   7                                                                    

 

Arvana’s current risk management strategy may not fully account for or mitigate the risks posed by emerging technologies or the potential impact of these limitations on our business. Financial liabilities, damage to our reputation, and erosion of customer trust could negatively affect our business operations and financial condition.

We have adopted a cybersecurity governance structure to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats that include a framework to respond to and assess internal and external threats to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Arvana’s data and information systems. Under which framework management is responsible for assessing and managing material risks that arise from cybersecurity threats. We have not engaged third-party qualified contractors or claim any management expertise from which to draw in the event of cybersecurity threats.

Governance

When identified by management, cybersecurity threats are to be immediately reported to Arvana’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity threats once a cybersecurity threat has been reported to it by management. Matters to be considered by the Audit Committee include management risks relating to data privacy, technology, and information security. The Audit Committee must also consider Arvana’s cyber security measures and the back-up of information systems, along with what steps Arvana has taken to monitor and control cybersecurity exposure. Further, the Audit Committee is tasked with the responsibility for conferring with management and Arvana’s auditors as to the adequacy and effectiveness of information safeguards, cybersecurity policies, and internal controls that impact information security. The Audit Committee will be briefed on any material cybersecurity incidents that might adversely affect our business at least once each year, such brief will include topics such as risk assessment, risk management, control decisions, service provider arrangements, security incidents, responses with recommendations for changes or updates to policies and procedures.

While Arvana has not experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, it cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity safeguards will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our third-party service providers’ information technology systems, particularly in the face of continually evolving cybersecurity threats and increasingly sophisticated threat actors.

A cybersecurity incident could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation, in addition to potentially subjecting us to government investigations, litigation, fines or damages.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

Arvana leases executive office is located at 299 Main Street, 13th Floor, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111. We pay an annual rent of $828 payable on a month-to-month basis.

Our business office is located at 901 25th Avenue W, Palmetto, Florida 34221. We paid a nominal fee for the use of a boat dock and two boat slips to cover the term of the lease that expires on December 31, 2025.

We believe that these arrangements are appropriate at this time given our focus on operating efficiencies and do not believe that we will need to maintain a larger spaces in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information

Shares of Arvana’s common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets Current Information Alternative Reporting electronic platform under the symbol “AVNI”.

Over-the-counter market quotations of our common stock reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

On February 22, 2023, Arvana’s stockholders approved a forward-split on a 3-1 basis of its outstanding common stock that was effected on April 19, 2023, to stockholders of record on March 31, 2023.

Holders

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “predicts,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in the subsection entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Our fiscal year end is December 31.

Discussion and Analysis

Overview

Arvana acquired Down2Fish on February 3, 2023, as a wholly owned subsidiary. Down2Fish operates a Florida based fishing charter business that offers a range of curated maritime adventures that include inshore, offshore, and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates its revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services.

                                                                   12                                                                   

 

Plan of Operation

Our plan of operation is to support the development of our business, and to build on its existing business model. We believe that an expansion of marketing efforts around Tampa Bay, to offer a wider range of services, such as dolphin tours, will help establish the Down2Fish brand, attract more customers and increase revenues. Expansion into new service offerings will however require capital sufficient to finance the purchase of another vessel and additional boating equipment. We believe that dolphin tours can return net revenue on a consistent basis if we are able to attract sufficient customers to each excursion. We are currently licensed and equipped to carry no more than six (6) customers on each fishing charter. A vessel designed primarily for dolphin tours can carry from fifty (50) to one hundred (100) customers. Our primary impediment for equipment procurement and installation is cost. We are presently considering financing options that might become available to us in the near term but have no assurance that financing options will become available or that if such did become available, that the financing terms would be tenable for our business. Unless or until we can offer excursions that cater to a greater number of customers on each excursion, we will continue to focus on offering more fishing charter excursions to build revenue and improve our results of operations.

While Arvana operates its fishing charter business it has continued to seek business opportunities in real estate development. On December 12, 2023, Arvana announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the business of FirstShot Centers, LLC, a Nevada based company intent on expanding its specialty use concept to acquire and repurpose vacant shopping malls, outlet locations and big bog stores throughout the United States to attract new tenants from targeted industries that offer goods or services that are not available online. The parties are yet to enter into a definitive agreement pending delivery of its business and financing plan.

Results of Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Arvana purchased Down2Fish as a wholly owned subsidiary, raised capital to sustain operations, evaluated other business opportunities, and offered charter fishing services.

Charter fishing services were curtailed in the third quarter of 2023 and halted in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to necessary repairs to both of our vessels under their respective warranties.

Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, were as follows below:

                                                                         Twelve Months Ended December 31

                                                                   13                                                                   

 

Revenue

Charter revenue from operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was $24,276 from $0 for the comparable twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue in the current twelve-month period is attributed to the purchase of Down2Fish in February of the current year. Revenue results for the current year were hampered by necessary repairs to both of our fishing charter vessels.

We expect charter revenue from operations to increase over the next twelve months as both of our fishing charter vessels return to active service.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, increased to $555,198 as compared to $165,831 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 235%. The increase in operating expenses over the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, is attributed to the addition of charter expenses, the increase in general and administrative expenses that included stock-based compensation, transfer agent costs and auditing expenses connected to the purchase of Down2Fish.

We expect operating expenses to increase in future periods as our business development strategies are implemented while auditing and accounting professional fees are expected to decrease over the next twelve months.

Other Expense (Income)

Other expense for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was $785,651 as compared to other income of $14,435 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022. The transition from other income to other expense over the comparative periods can be primarily attributed to the loss recognized with the acquisition of Down2Fishon and interest expanse offset by lease income realized in the current twelve-month period. Other income in the current prior-month period can be attributed to an amount forgiven in connection with a rescission and mutual release agreement, offset by interest expense.

We expect other expense to decrease over future periods as debt instruments tied to the fishing charter vessels are satisfied and lease income increases.

Net Loss 

Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $1,316,573, as compared to a net loss of $151,395 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 770%. The increase in net loss in the current twelve-month period over the prior comparable period can be primarily attributed to an increase in losses from operating expenses, interest expenses and the loss recognized on the asset purchase of Down2Fish, offset by the realization of revenue from charter boat services and other income that is generated through a lease of the charter vessels.

We expect to continue to realize net losses from operations over the next twelve months as management works to implement its business model.

Capital Expenditures

We expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the respective twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

                                                                   14                                                                   

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception, Arvana has experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and stockholders’ deficit.

We had current assets of $27,171 as of December 31, 2023, that consisted of cash, and a bond as compared to current assets of $142,365 as of December 31, 2022, that consisted solely of cash. Total assets were $216,549 as of December 31, 2023, that consisted of current assets, property, equipment, and intangible assets, as compared to total assets, of $142,365 as of December 31, 2022, that consisted solely of cash. We had a working capital deficit of $311,316 as of December 31, 2023, as compared to a working capital surplus of $104,495 as of December 31, 2022. Net stockholders' deficit in Arvana was $962,126 at December 31, 2023, as compared to a net stockholders' equity in Arvana of $104,495 at December 31, 2022.

The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

                                                                         Twelve Months Ended December 31

     Financing activities                                                    140,376                272,263               (131,887)

Increase (decrease) in cash                                         $       (120,294)               139,025               (259,319)

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $206,118 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $133,238 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities in the current period can be attributed to book expense items that do not affect the total amount relative to actual cash used, such as share based compensation, depreciation, and loss on asset purchase. Balance sheet accounts that affect cash but are not income statement related that are added or deducted to arrive at cash used in operating activities, include accounts payable and amounts due to related parties.

We expect net cash used in operating activities to continue over the next twelve months as we implement our business plan.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $54,552 as compared to $0 net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities in the current twelve-month period can be attributed to asset acquisition and the purchase of fixed assets offset by amounts received from the sale of fixed assets.

We expect to use net cash in investing activities in the near term as investment will be required of us in connection with the expansion our fishing charter business.

                                                                   15                                                                   

 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $140,376, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $272,263 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash provided from financing activities in the current twelve-month period consisted of proceeds from loans payable to related parties offset by payments made on loans payable to related parties. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $272,263, consisted of a private equity placement offset by payments on loans payable to related parties and equity issuance costs.

We expect to continue to use net cash provided by financing activities over the next twelve months generated through additional private equity placements, public offerings, or private debt to expand our business.

Arvana does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Arvana had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of December 31, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

A summary of our critical accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to the audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, that are included in this Form 10-K. We discuss accounting policies that are significant in determining our results of operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities.”

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders’ of Arvana Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arvana Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for year ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Explanatory Paragraph – Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses, has incurred negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had an operating loss of $530,922, net cash $206,118 and working capital deficit of $311,316. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

We did not identify any critical audit matters that need to be communicated.



We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.

Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

Arvana Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as “Turinco, Inc.”, and on July 24, 2006, changed its name to Arvana Inc. to reflect the acquisition of a telecommunications business. We discontinued efforts related to our telecommunications business as of December 31, 2009. The Company acquired Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC on February 3, 2023 (D2F). D2F was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on April 1, 2019.

D2F operates a Florida based fishing charter business that offers a range of curated maritime adventures that include inshore, offshore, and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. D2F generates its revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services.

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) for financial information with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-K. Results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved in future periods.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates include the recognition of deferred tax assets based on the change in unrecognized deductible temporary tax differences.

 

Stock Split

On February 21, 2023, stockholders approved a forward-split of the Company’s common shares on a 3-1 basis. The forward-split was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State effective March 31, 2023, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rolled the stock forward on April 19, 2023. All changes in the capital structure have been given retroactive effect in these financial statements.

                                                                  F-7                                                                   

 

Financial Instruments

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such values:

Cash - the carrying amount approximates fair value.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable to stockholders, and amounts payable to related parties - the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash. The Company maintains cash in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively, the Company did not have any cash in excess of the insured FDIC limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank account.

Income Taxes

A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for all stock-based payments to employees and non-employees under ASC 718 “Stock Compensation,” which requires that the value of the award is established at the date of grant and is expensed over the vesting period of the grant. The method of determining the fair value of share-based payments depends on the type of award. Share-based awards that vest over a certain service period with no market conditions are valued at the closing market price on the grant date. Options grants are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model using inputs that are determined on the date of the grant. Once the per-share fair value on the date of grant is established, the aggregate expense of the grant is recognized as earned over the vesting period of the grant. The cost of stock-based payments to non-employees if fully vested and non-forfeitable at the grant date, is measured and recognized at that date.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including stock options and warrants. The Company had 7,950,000 outstanding stock options as at December 31, 2023, and none at December 31, 2022, which have been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their effects would be anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted by the Company

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, effective January 1, 2023, which adoption has not had a material effect on its financial statements.

Note 2 – Going Concern

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a net loss of $1,316,573 and has negative cash flows from operations totaling $118,652. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit of $311,316 and an accumulated deficit of $37,556,941. The Company has incurred significant losses since inception. While the Company commenced revenue generating activities in the first quarter of 2023, it will require funding from outside sources to implement its business development strategy. The Company has no firm commitments for additional funding. The aggregation of these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these consolidated financial statements are made available. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Failure to obtain the ongoing support of stockholders and creditors may indicate that the preparation of these consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis is inappropriate, in which case our assets and liabilities would need to be recognized at their liquidation values. The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and liabilities that might arise from this uncertainty.

Note 3 – Asset Acquisition

On February 3, 2023 (Closing Date), the company acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Down2Fish Charters, LLC (D2F), a limited liability company organized under the laws of Florida, which operates a charter fishing business. On the Closing Date, the Company paid $50,000 in cash and issued a note for $700,000 for a total consideration of $750,000. The Company’s consolidated statements of operations from the Closing Date through December 31, 2023, indicate a net loss of $1,316,573.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the Closing Date under the acquisition method of accounting. The estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities including long-lived assets require judgment and assumptions. Adjustments may be made to these estimates during the measurement period and those adjustments could be material.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their fair values as of the Closing Date, with the excess of cost over fair value of $771,009. For the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $771,009 on the excess amount. Assets acquired are as follows:

                                                                  F-10

The Company did not incur any acquisition related costs during the period.

Property and equipment acquired consisted primarily of offshore support vessels. The Company recorded property and equipment acquired at an estimated fair value of $178,706. The fair values of the offshore support vessels were estimated by applying a replacement cost approach. These assets will be tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company estimates the remaining useful lives for the vessels acquired are seven years, based on an original estimated useful life of 10 years.

The charter fishing license acquired is a perpetual federal fishing license, which grants the Company access to fish in federally regulated waters off the coast of Florida. This asset is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Arvana previously reported a change in its independent registered public accounting firm in a Form 8-K report pursuant to §13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act on May 3, 2023.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the preparation of this annual report, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, of the effectiveness of Arvana’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Based on that evaluation, management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that Arvana’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and such information was accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management has assessed the effectiveness of these internal controls as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on this assessment, our chief executive officer identified the following material weakness in connection with his review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2023.

Arvana relies one individual who has sole responsibility for the preparation of financial reporting disclosure in his capacity as chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Our inaction to bifurcate the duties of each office is a material weakness that could impact financial reporting. Management has concluded, despite this material weakness, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. While management does not believe that this material weakness affected our financial results in the current period, it does believe that this weakness could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements in future periods that might not be prevented or detected in a timely manner.

Arvana has a remediation plan to address this weakness that will involve engaging a second qualified individual to serve as its chief financial officer. We are committed to this plan as a means to strengthen Arvana’s internal controls to ensure the accuracy of its financial reporting. The time frame for engaging a second qualified individual has not yet been determined.

                                                                   17                                                                   

 

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Our annual report does not include an attestation report of Arvana’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

During the year ended December 31, 2023, there has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

9B. OTHER INFORMATION

None.

9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICATIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS

Corporate Social Responsibility

We believe that social responsibility is essential for a healthy and equitable corporate culture; one that balances the interests of its various worldwide stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, and our potential partners and customers. We are committed to sound corporate citizenship in the way we manage our people, our business and our impact on society and the environment. Furthermore, we acknowledge our responsibility to ensure our products will be designed, developed, and supplied in an environmentally safe and sound manner. We believe that we obey and comply with all laws and regulations that apply to us in the communities where we do business. Further, we value our stockholders’ governance view and will solicit feedback from our stockholders relating to matters that are important to them, on environmental, social and governance topics.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings

To the best of our knowledge, none of the following events occurred during the past ten years that are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any of our executive officers, directors, or promoters:

(1) A petition under the federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law was filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing;

(2) Convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);

Director Independence and Board Committees

We are not required under the Exchange Act to maintain any committees of our Board. Further, we are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which have requirements that a majority of the board of directors be “independent” or maintain any committees of our Board and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board comprised of a majority of “independent directors” or to have any committees. However, we do have two independent directors on our Board around which we formed a compensation committee to administer the 2022 Arvana Stock Incentive Plan and an audit committee.

Meetings of the Board

During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Board met on four occasions by telephonic means, and otherwise transacted Arvana’s business by unanimous written consent.

Family Relationships

There are no family relationships by between or among the members of the Board or other executive officers of Arvana.

Indemnification 

Our articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions limiting the liability of directors and officers and indemnifying them under certain circumstances. We further intend to secure directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in the near term. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Arvana pursuant to Nevada law, we are informed that in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

                                                                   21                                                                   

 

Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert

The Board has established an audit committee that is comprised of Sir John Baring, Shawn Teigen, and Ruairidh Campbell. While the Board has determined that Ruairidh Campbell qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert”, as defined by the rules of the Commission, it has further determined that he should not be considered “independent” as that term is defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2).

The audit committee recommends independent accountants to audit its financial statements, discusses the scope and results of the audit with our independent accountants, considers the adequacy of internal accounting controls, considers audit procedures and reviews non-audit services performed by our independent accountants.

The audit committee would also be called upon to oversee our cybersecurity framework in the event management identifies a cybersecurity threat.

Code of Ethics

We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our directors, officers, and employees.

A copy of our Code of Ethics is incorporated by reference, to the Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2006, filed as an exhibit thereto on April 16, 2007.

Significant Employees

Our executive officer is Arvana’s sole significant employee.

Term of Office

Our directors are appointed for one (1) year terms to hold office until the next annual stockholders meeting or until removed from the Board in accordance with Arvana’s bylaws.

Arvana’s executive officer retains his position in accordance with his employment agreement, subject to removal by the Board, or his resignation.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight

Our chief executive officer, and chief financial officer also serves as a member of the Board. Despite reliance on one individual to fill more than one role, we do not have a policy regarding the separation of these roles. We expect to bifurcate the roles of chief executive officer and chief financial officer to remediate an internal control weakness. Once bifurcation is accomplished our chief executive officer will likely remain on the Board until resignation or removal by our stockholders.

The Board has determined that the present leadership structure is appropriate for Arvana and its stockholders. The structure helps ensure that the Board and management act with a common purpose with a single, clear chain of command to execute strategic initiatives. Further, our Board believes that the combined role of chief executive officer and Board member positions leadership to act as a bridge between management and the Board to facilitate the regular flow of information.

                                                                   22                                                                   

 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by Commission regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all such applicable filing requirements were met.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The objective of our compensation program is to incentivize management for services rendered and to reward management on fulfilling corporate objectives.

Arvana entered into an employment agreement with its sole executive officer effective September 1, 2023, who prior to that date was compensated based on amounts invoiced as a related party for services rendered. The Board determined to transition from “shell” status in 2022, and at that time decided to enter into an employment agreement with its sole executive officer intended to motivate him to fulfill that transition. Arvana exited “shell” status in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that our chief executive’s employment agreement is adequate to compensate him for his service to Arvana and is in line with compensatory packages typical of other smaller reporting companies.

Executive compensation paid or accrued to our sole executive officer for the periods ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $120,000 and $191,731 (includes option awards) respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred director’s fees of $1,600 (2022 - $1,600).

The information provided below with respect to “named executive officers,” as defined by Commission regulations, includes compensation paid or accrued to our sole executive officer during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. Arvana had no other executive officers, or non-executive officers or employees whose total compensation during the respective fiscal years presented exceeded $100,000.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of April 5, 2024, by:

 •    each of our named executive officers;



 •    each of our directors;



 •    all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; and



 •    each person, or group of affiliated persons, who beneficially own more than 5% of our stock.

Shares that a person has the right to acquire within 60 days thereof, are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such rights but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person, except with respect to the percentage ownership of all directors and executive officers as a group.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

None of our directors or executive officers, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director, nor any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to all of our outstanding shares, nor any members of the immediate family (including spouse, parents, children, siblings, and in−laws) of any of the foregoing persons has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction since the beginning of our last fiscal year or in any presently proposed transaction which, in either case, has or will materially affect us except as described below:

   • Bondock Ltd. – owned by a stockholder, Brian Lovig, holding shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our

      outstanding shares, accepted four promissory notes from Arvana in the aggregate amount of $65,000, all of which were assigned

      and repaid in the current fiscal

      year.



   • Bondock LLC – owned by a stockholder, Brian Lovig, holding shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our

      outstanding shares, accepted one promissory note from Arvana in the amount of $4,500, which was assigned and repaid in the

Director Independence

Our common stock is traded on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets electronic quotation platform, and it is not held to the corporate governance standards of listed companies. Listed companies require, in addition to other governance criteria, that a majority of a board of directors be independent. While Arvana is not subject to corporate governance standards relating to the independence of its directors, we define an “independent” director in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2)). Arvana has two independent directors on its Board under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rule.

                                                                   27

Our Audit Committee pre-approves all audit services to be provided to us by our independent auditors. Our Audit Committee’s policy regarding the pre-approval of non-audit services to be provided to us by our independent auditors is that all such services shall be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Prior to the granting of any pre-approval, our Audit Committee must be satisfied that the performance of the services in question will not compromise the independence of the auditors.
