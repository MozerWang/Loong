CUTERA, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.         Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Description of Operations and Principles of Consolidation

Cutera, Inc. (“Cutera” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, distributes, and markets energy-based product platforms for medical practitioners, enabling them to offer treatments to their customers. In addition, the Company distributes third-party manufactured skincare products, until the termination of distribution agreement in February 2024, and Secret PRO and Secret RF systems and consumables. The Company currently markets the following system platforms: AviClear, enlighten, excel HR, excel V/V+, truSculpt, Secret PRO, Secret DUO, Secret RF, xeo, and xeo+ — each of which enables medical practitioners to perform procedures including treatment for acne, body contouring, skin resurfacing and revitalization, hair and tattoo removal, removal of benign pigmented lesions, and vascular conditions. Several of the Company’s systems offer multiple hand pieces and applications, providing customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems.

The sale of systems, hand pieces, upgrade of systems, and leasing and direct sales of AviClear devices (collectively “Systems” revenue); replacement hand pieces, truSculpt cycle refills, truFlex cycle refills, AviClear treatment fees, and single use disposable tips applicable to Secret systems (collectively “Consumables” revenue); and the distribution of third-party manufactured skincare products (“Skincare”) revenue are collectively classified as “Products” revenue. In addition to Products revenue, the Company generates revenue from the sale of post-warranty service contracts and service parts and labor for the repair and maintenance of products that are out of warranty, all of which are collectively classified as “Service” revenue.

The Company’s corporate headquarters and U.S. operations are located in Brisbane, California, where the Company conducts manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, regulatory, sales and marketing, service, and administrative activities. The Company also maintains regional distribution centers (“RDCs”) in select locations across the U.S. These RDCs serve as forward warehousing for systems and service parts in various geographies. The Company markets, sells and services the Company’s products through direct sales and service employees in North America (including Canada), Australia, New Zealand, Austria, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Repblic of Ireland. Sales and services outside of these direct markets are made through a worldwide distributor network in over 38 countries. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Liquidity and Management’s Plans

When preparing financial statements, management has the responsibility to evaluate if the Company has adequate liquidity to continue to operate for the next twelve months. In performing this assessment, management considered the Company's current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds, forecasted future cash flows and unconditional obligations due over the next twelve months. In addition, management evaluated the history of the Company's financial performance, and determined that the Company has had a historic trend of operating losses, which continues to have an unfavorable impact on the Company's overall liquidity. Most recently, the Company reported net losses of $22.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $162.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company believes that it will continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the issuance of its condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The Company’s continued operations will depend on several factors, including but not limited to, growth of revenues from its revised business model for AviClear, which entails transitioning from a lease model to a direct sales model, maintaining or increasing revenues from sales of legacy systems, consumables and services, achieving cost savings as a result of workforce reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023, restructuring of supplier and manufacturing relationships, and initiatives to improve inventory and receivables management. Failure to increase revenue, achieve cost savings, raise additional financing or re-finance the existing convertible notes when they become due, would adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, and delays may occur in completing the operating activities.

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of its condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and its condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of

comprehensive loss, condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' deficit, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The December 31, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year or any other interim period. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s previously filed audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 10, 2024.

Reclassification

The Company reclassified the interest expense portion previously recorded in interest income (expense), net to other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Corresponding reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported net loss.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company's future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company's future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, rapid technological change, continued acceptance of the Company's products, stability of global financial markets, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions that could compromise the Company’s information or results, business disruptions that are caused by natural disasters or pandemic events, management of international activities, competition from substitute products and larger companies, the Company's ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, government regulations and oversight, patent and other types of litigation, the Company's ability to protect proprietary technology from counterfeit versions of the Company's products and its intellectual property rights generally, the successful execution of new product launches, the continuation of strategic relationships, such as the Company's distribution of third-party products, and dependence on key individuals.

Accounting Policies

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to interim financial statements. While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. 

Leases

The Company incurred costs to fulfill its lease agreement obligations with its AviClear device lessees. These costs consisted of freight, installation, and training. In addition to these mobilization costs, the Company incurred commission costs associated with the placement of the AviClear device. The Company capitalized commission costs and made a policy election to capitalize the mobilization costs. 

The Company determined to cease new leases of the AviClear device in 2023 and, therefore the Company no longer capitalizes additional mobilization costs and commission costs related to placements of the AviClear device, which were recorded in other long-term assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets and were amortized over the expected lease term. The amortization of the remaining mobilization costs and amortization of deferred commission costs are recorded in cost of revenue and sales and marketing, respectively, in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations. Total capitalized mobilization costs were $1.5 million and $2.1 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total capitalized commissions as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to warranty obligations, sales commissions, allowance for credit losses, sales allowances, fair value of investments, valuation of inventories, fair value of goodwill, useful lives of property and equipment, impairment testing for long-lived assets, implicit and incremental borrowing rates related to the Company’s leases, variables used in calculating the fair value of the Company's equity awards, expected achievement of performance-based vesting criteria and management performance bonuses, assumptions used in operating and sales-type lease classifications, the standalone selling price of the Company's products and services, the period of benefit used to capitalize and amortize contract acquisition costs, variable considerations, contingent liabilities, recoverability of deferred tax assets, residual value of leased equipment, lease term and effective income tax rates. Management bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Distribution of Third-Party Products 

The Company generated revenue from the distribution of skincare products, which were manufactured by ZO Skin Health, Inc. (“ZO”), and sold in the Japanese market. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, revenue from the distribution of skincare products was $4.2 million and $8.1 million, respectively, representing 11% and 15% of the Company’s consolidated revenue, respectively. 

On February 28, 2024, the Company and its Japanese subsidiary, Cutera KK, entered into a termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with ZO USA and its Japanese subsidiary, ZO Skin Health GK (“ZO Japan” and together with ZO USA and their affiliates, “ZO”), which, among other things, (i) terminates all agreements related to the distribution by the Company of ZO’s products in Japan effective immediately, (ii) provides for the orderly transition of the distribution of ZO products to ZO, (iii) transfers certain Company employees dedicated to the distribution of ZO products to ZO, (iv) transfers certain customer contracts related to ZO products from the Company to ZO and (v) transfers certain inventory and assets related to the distribution of ZO products from the Company to ZO. The Termination Agreement requires ZO to pay the Company $5.75 million within three business days of the execution of the Termination Agreement and make a second payment of $5.75 million, less any offsets under the Termination Agreement (including, but not limited to, 42.2% of the Company’s net revenue for sales of ZO products under the Distribution Agreement between January 1, 2024 and February 28, 2024), upon the earlier of (a) the completion the transition of regulatory and distribution activities such that ZO is able to fulfill product orders by customers in Japan, as determined by ZO and the Company, and (b) June 14, 2024. The Company received the first payment of $5.75 million on February 29, 2024, and received a second payment of $2.37 million on April 1, 2024, which was net of $1.6 million in amounts owed by Cutera. The In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded the net gain of $9.7 million resulting from the early termination proceeds received and the transfer of certain assets and liabilities as gain on early termination of distribution agreement on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The Company generates revenue from the distribution of the Secret systems, which are manufactured by ilooda Co. Ltd. (“ilooda”). The Company is the exclusive distributor for all systems sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom; the exclusive distributor for certain systems in France, and Spain; and the non-exclusive distributor for systems sold in Austria and Germany. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, revenue from the distribution of Secret products represented 6% and 4%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company‘s ilooda distribution agreement expires in June 30, 2026. 

Termination of Manufacturing Service Agreement

In November 2023, the Company communicated its intention not to renew its existing manufacturing service agreement (“Manufacturing Service Agreement”) with Jabil Inc. (“Jabil”), a third-party manufacturing provider that manufactured excel V+ and AviClear devices for the Company. At the time of the communication of non-renewal, the Company concluded that it would have an obligation to purchase unshipped inventory from Jabil. The Company subsequently received claims from Jabil related to other amounts associated with the termination and entered into settlement discussions with Jabil. 

On February 28, 2024, the Company and Jabil signed a settlement agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) for the non-renewal of its existing Manufacturing Service Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provided for a payment by Cutera to Jabil of $19.5 million, to be offset by $1.3 million in amounts owed by Jabil. The $19.5 million payment to Jabil relates to the Company's receipt of $13.5 million of inventories, $0.3 million of equipment, and the payment of $5.7 million for expenses either previously incurred by Jabil or associated with the non-renewal of the Manufacturing Services Agreement. 

The Company recorded the net balance of the $19.5 million payment owed to Jabil and the $15.1 million aggregate of inventories, equipment, and other amounts owed to Cutera, in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The $5.7 million for expenses incurred by Jabil was recorded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

Note 2.         Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Marketable Investments

The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. 

The Company’s marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities. Investments with remaining maturities of more than one year are viewed by the Company as available to support current operations and are classified as current assets under the caption marketable investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair value under the guidance in ASC 320. Credit losses on impaired available-for-sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses. Under ASC 326, credit losses recognized on an available-for-sale debt security should not reduce the net carrying amount of the available-for-sale debt security below its fair value. Any changes in fair value unrelated to credit are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents was $105.4 million and $143.6 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no marketable investments or restricted cash as of those dates.

Note 3.         Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures certain financial assets at fair value, including cash and cash equivalents. 

The fair value hierarchy contains the following three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, in accordance with ASC 820:

•Level 1 inputs, which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third-party data providers. These inputs either represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data; and

•Level 3 inputs, which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.

In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considering counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.

As of March 31, 2024, financial assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis and classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as described above were as follows (in thousands):

Note 7.         Revenue

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time. Revenue from performance obligations that are transferred to customers over time accounted for approximately 14% of the Company's total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

The Company has certain system sale arrangements that contain multiple products and services. For these bundled sale arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services as separate performance obligations if they are distinct. The Company’s products and services are distinct if a customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and if the Company’s promise to transfer the products or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the sale arrangements. The Company’s system sale arrangements can include all or a combination of the following performance obligations: the system and software license (considered one performance obligation), system accessories (hand pieces), training, AviClear license agreements, other accessories, extended service contracts, marketing services, and time and materials services.

For the Company’s system sale arrangements that include an extended service contract, the period of service commences at the expiration of the Company’s standard warranty offered at the time of the system sale. The Company considers the extended service contracts terms in the arrangements that are legally enforceable to be performance obligations. Other than extended service contracts and marketing services, which are satisfied over time, the Company generally satisfies all performance obligations at a point in time. Systems, system accessories (hand pieces), service contracts, training, and time and materials services are also sold on a stand-alone basis. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. 

Nature of Products and Services

Systems

Systems revenue is generated from the sale of systems and from the sale of upgrades to existing systems. A system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface, a laser or other energy-based module, control system software and high voltage electronics, as well as one or more hand pieces. In certain applications, the laser or other energy-based module is contained in the hand piece, rather than within the console.

The Company offers customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost-effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows. This provides customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they choose and provides the Company with a source of additional Systems revenue.

The system or upgrade and the right to use the embedded software represent a single performance obligation as the software license is integral to the functionality of the system or upgrade.

For systems sold directly to end-customers that are credit approved, revenue is recognized when the Company transfers control to the end-customer, which occurs when the product is shipped to the customer or when the customer receives the product, depending on the nature of the arrangement. When collectability is not established in advance of receipt of payment from the customer, revenue is recognized upon the later of the receipt of payment or the satisfaction of the performance obligation. For systems sold through credit approved distributors, revenue is recognized at the time of shipment to the distributor.

The Company leases certain AviClear devices to customers and receives a fixed annual license fee over the term of the arrangement and variable lease income related to treatments performed by the lessee. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company announced a change in the AviClear business strategy and moved towards a direct sales model rather than a leasing model, whereby certain existing lessees were offered an option to purchase the leased AviClear device. The Company classifies its lease income and direct sales as product revenue and classifies the AviClear lease contracts as operating leases for the devices under the leasing model. The fixed annual license fee is recognized evenly over the period of the lease contract on a straight-line basis. The treatment fee is recognized as consumable revenue in the period the treatment protocol is initiated.



The Company's payment terms for its system consoles and other accessories require payment within 30 days of shipment. Certain international distributor arrangements allow for longer payment terms.

Consumables and other accessories

The Company classifies its customers' purchases of replacement cycles for truSculpt and truFlex, as well as replacement hand pieces, xeo and truSculpt 3D hand pieces, AviClear treatment fee revenue, and single use disposable tips applicable to Secret PRO, and Secret RF as Consumable revenue. The Secret PRO, Secret DUO, and Secret RF products' single use disposable tips must be replaced after every treatment. The Company’s systems offer multiple hand pieces and applications, which allow customers to upgrade their systems. Revenue for consumables and other accessories is recognized when products are shipped to customers.

Skincare products

The Company generated revenue from the distribution of skincare products, which were manufactured by ZO Skin Health, Inc. (“ZO”), and sold in the Japanese market to medical offices and licensed physicians. The Company warranted that the skincare products are free of significant defects in workmanship and materials for 90 days from shipment. The Company acted as the principal in this arrangement, as the Company determined the price to charge customers for the skincare products and controlled the products before they were transferred to the customer. The Company recognized revenue for skincare products at a point in time upon shipment.

On February 28, 2024, the Company entered into a termination agreement with ZO, which terminated all agreements related to the distribution by the Company of ZO’s products in Japan, as disclosed in Note 1. Through February 2024, revenue from the distribution of skincare products was $4.2 million.

Extended service contract 

The Company offers post-warranty services to its customers through extended service contracts that cover parts and labor for a term of one to three years. Service contract revenue is recognized over time, using a time-based measure of progress, as customers benefit from the service throughout the service period. The Company also offers services on a time and materials basis for systems and detachable hand piece replacements. Revenue related to services performed on a time and materials basis is recognized when performed.

Training

Sales of systems to customers include training on the use of the system to be provided within 90 days of purchase. The Company considers training a separate performance obligation as customers can immediately benefit from the training, and training is also sold separately from systems. The Company recognizes revenue for training when the training is provided.

Significant Judgments

The Company determines standalone selling price ("SSP") for each performance obligation as follows:

•Systems: The SSPs for systems are based on directly observable sales in similar circumstances to similar customers.

•Extended warranty/Service contracts: SSP is based on observable price when sold on a standalone basis to similar customers.

Deferred Sales Commissions

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract related to the sale of a system, which consist primarily of commissions and related payroll taxes, are capitalized, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, except for costs that are recognized when the product is sold. The Company uses the portfolio method to recognize the amortization expense related to these capitalized costs related to initial contracts and such expense is recognized over a period associated with the revenue of the related portfolio, which is generally two to three years.

Total capitalized commissions as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $2.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Amortization expense for these assets was $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The amortization related to these capitalized costs is included in sales and marketing expense on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The equity plans deduct the shares available for issuance by the gross number of shares for which an award is exercised or vests, not the net number of shares actually issued upon exercise, in the event the exercise price is paid in shares of the Company's common stock or shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Any RSU or PSU shares granted on or after July 13, 2023 are counted against the shares available for grant at a ratio of 1.65 shares for every one share granted.

Note 9.     Net Loss Per Share



As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s Convertible Notes were potentially convertible into 8,696,792 shares of common stock.



The denominator for diluted net loss per share does not include any effect from the capped call transactions the Company entered into concurrently with the issuances of convertible notes, as this effect would be anti-dilutive. In the event of conversion of a convertible note, shares delivered to the Company under the capped call will offset the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company would issue under the convertible notes. In the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the if-converted method was not applied as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.



For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, a basic loss per common share and diluted loss per common share are the same in each period as the inclusion of any potentially issuable shares would be anti-dilutive.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss and the weighted average number of shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):

Note 11.     Leases

Lessee

The Company is a party to certain operating and finance leases for vehicles, office space and storage facilities. The Company’s material operating leases consist of office space, as well as storage facilities and finance leases consist of automobile leases. The Company’s leases generally have remaining terms of one to 7 years, some of which include options to renew the leases for up to five years. The Company leases space for operations in the United States, Japan, Belgium, France, and Spain. 

The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, the Company estimates the incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. The Company based the rate estimates on prevailing financial market conditions, credit analysis, and management judgment. 

Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce the Company’s right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term.

The Company leases the AviClear device to customers and receives a fixed annual license fee over the term of the arrangement and variable revenue related to the number of treatments performed by the lessee. The contractual term of the lease agreement is three years with a one-year auto-renewal feature. Certain lease agreements' terms in excess of one year can be terminated without financial penalty, and these agreements are accounted for as having a lease term of one year. The AviClear lease agreements are accounted for as operating leases. The fixed annual license fee is recognized evenly throughout the period of the lease agreement on a straight-line basis. The treatment revenue is recognized in the period the lessee has the ability to perform the patient treatment.

Practical Expedients

The Company elected to apply a practical expedient to operating leases and elected not to separate lease and nonlease components as long as the lease and at least one nonlease component have the same timing and pattern of transfer. As such, updates or upgrades on a when-and-if available basis to the AviClear device are combined with the operating lease revenue. The combined component is being accounted for under ASC 842. Additionally, the Company made an accounting policy election to present AviClear revenue net of sales and other similar taxes.

Capitalized sales commissions

Sales commissions related to obtaining AviClear lease agreements are accounted for as initial direct costs and are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expenses for these assets were $0.3 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and $1.0 million for the comparative period ended March 31, 2023, and were included in sales and marketing expense on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations. Total capitalized commissions as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $2.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Lease installment costs



The Company capitalizes fulfillment costs incurred before AviClear lease commencement and these costs include freight, installation, and training costs. Amortization expenses for these assets were $0.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 and $0.5 million for the comparative periods ended March 31, 2023, and were included in cost of revenue on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations. Total lease installment costs as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $1.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Note 12.     Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is named from time to time as a party to other legal proceedings, product liability, intellectual property disputes, commercial disputes, employee disputes, and contractual lawsuits. A liability and related charge are recorded to earnings in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with outside legal counsel. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If a material loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. Certain of the cases below are still in the preliminary stages, and the Company is not able to quantify the extent of its potential liability, if any, other than as described. The outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to the Company, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, defending these legal proceedings is likely to be costly, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of its business. 

On January 31, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against Lutronic Aesthetics in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. Lutronic employs numerous former Cutera employees. The complaint against Lutronic generally alleges claims for (1) misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of state and federal law; (2) violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"); (3) interference with contractual relations; (4) interference with prospective economic advantage; (5) unfair competition; and (6) aiding and abetting. On March 13, 2020, the court entered a temporary restraining order ("TRO") against Lutronic generally prohibiting it from using or disseminating the Company's confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information. The order also prohibited Lutronic, for two years, from using such information for the purpose of soliciting, or conducting business with, certain specified customers. On April 9, 2020, the parties stipulated to the entry of a preliminary injunction providing for the same relief afforded by the TRO. On August 4, 2022, Cutera filed a second amended complaint. In addition to the above referenced claims, Cutera alleged claims for violation of the Lanham Act, unlawful business practices, false advertising and trademark infringement. Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been scheduled. On April 27, 2023, Lutronic filed a complaint for trade libel, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair business practices against Cutera in California State Court. Discovery has not yet commenced and no trial date has been scheduled. The Company denies the allegations of the complaint and has instructed counsel to defend the matter vigorously. Discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been scheduled.

In March 2023, Serendia, LLC (“Serendia”), filed patent infringement complaints against the Company with the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of six Serendia patents by the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems, which the Company distributes in the U.S. on behalf of Ilooda Co. Ltd., a Korean company (“ilooda”). The manufacturer of these products, ilooda, is obligated to defend the Company against these claims and, as a result, the Company has not incurred significant external legal costs. Serendia and ilooda have agreed to a settlement of the ITC investigation, the Delaware litigation and any other past, present and future suits or claims related to the six Serendia patents and the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems. The settlement of these matters includes a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid up license from Serendia to ilooda to the six Serendia patents related to the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems, which are distributed by the Company. The ITC investigation as to ilooda and the Company was terminated as of April 10, 2024 and the Delaware litigation was dismissed as of April 3, 2024.

On April 11, 2023, J. Daniel Plants, the Company’s former Executive Chairperson, and David Mowry, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against directors Gregory Barrett, Sheila Hopkins, Timothy O’Shea, Juliane Park and Janet Widmann, as defendants, and the Company, as nominal defendant (the “Delaware Litigation”) seeking a declaration that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and enjoining them from enforcing the nomination deadline under the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws in connection with the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, or in the alternative, a declaration that the Company must hold a special meeting of the stockholders on June 2, 2023. Mr. Plants and Mr. Mowry filed a motion for expedited proceedings with their complaint. Mr. Plants and Mr. Mowry subsequently agreed that the determination made by the Special Committee of the Board to hold a special meeting of the stockholders on June 9, 2023 mooted their request in the Delaware Litigation for a declaration that the Company hold a special meeting of the stockholders. On April 18, 2023, the Court of Chancery denied Mr. Plants and Mr. Mowry’s motion for expedited proceedings.



On May 16, 2023, Mr. Mowry filed a letter with the Court of Chancery disclosing that he had resolved his dispute with the defendants and agreed to dismiss his claims with prejudice. On May 17, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted an order for voluntary dismissal of Mr. Mowry as a plaintiff in the Delaware Litigation. Mr. Plants subsequently publicly voiced opposition

to certain aspects of the Company's corporate governance and strategy but did not submit a notice of nomination of director candidates for the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders and did not purport to nominate any director candidates at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on July 13, 2023. Due to Plaintiff’s failure to amend his Complaint within the time required by the Court’s order dated October 6, 2023, the Delaware Litigation was dismissed with prejudice.



On October 5, 2023, Mr. Plants filed a Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”) discrimination claim (the “SOX Whistleblower Complaint”) with the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). Mr. Plants alleges that he was terminated on April 11, 2023, in retaliation for reporting to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) his concerns that budgeting and guiding to higher forecasts for 2023 would be misleading to shareholders. The SOX Whistleblower Complaint referenced the April 3, 2023 letter from Mr. Plants to the Company’s Board that articulated Mr. Plants’ concerns. The Company received notice of the SOX Whistleblower Complaint on November 8, 2023. 



On December 7, 2023, Mr. Plants made an arbitration demand in JAMS against the Company, Mr. Barrett, Ms. Hopkins, Mr. O’Shea, Ms. Park and Ms. Widmann for claims related to the termination of his employment (the “Arbitration Demand”). Mr. Plants alleges several claims: breach of his change of control and severance agreement; wrongful termination; retaliation in violation of California’s whistleblower laws; retaliation in violation of SOX; defamation/libel; tortious interference with prospective economic advantage; and breach of oral contract. He seeks compensatory, special, and punitive damages, as well as reinstatement, civil penalties, and attorneys’ fees and costs. Mr. Plants and the Company have agreed to a settlement of all claims against the Company and the parties listed in the Arbitration Demand. The OSHA investigation was officially closed on April 26, 2024, and the JAMS arbitration was dismissed as of April 19, 2024.

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued $3.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, related to various pending commercial and product liability lawsuits. The Company does not believe that a material loss in excess of accrued amounts is reasonably likely.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $9.7 million of non-cancelable inventory purchase obligations with a certain vendor due in 2024.

•During any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day;

•During the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;

•The Company calls such 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or

•Upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.

On or after December 15, 2025, and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

The circumstances described in the bullets of the paragraph above were not met during the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the 2026 Notes are not convertible. The 2026 Notes may become convertible in future periods. Upon any conversion requests of the 2026 Notes, the Company would be required to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election with respect to such conversion requests. To the extent there are any conversion requests during the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the

Table of Contents 

Company intends to settle such conversion requests in shares of common stock. Therefore, as of March 31, 2024, the 2026 Notes have been included as Long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The Company may not redeem the 2026 Notes prior to March 20, 2024. On or after March 20, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at the Company’s option, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company elects to redeem fewer than all of the outstanding 2026 Notes, at least $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date.

If a specified corporate event occurs, 2026 Note holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase any portion or all of their 2026 Notes in $1,000 principal increments for cash. The price for such repurchase is calculated as 100% of the principal amounts of 2026 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change repurchase date. Additionally, holders of the 2026 Notes who convert in connection with a fundamental change are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in conversion rate.

The 2026 Notes are general senior unsecured obligations that rank senior to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is explicitly subordinated to the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes have equal rank in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated to the 2026 Notes (including the 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes). The 2026 Notes will be junior to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

The estimated fair value of the 2026 Notes was approximately $26.5 million as of March 31, 2024, which the Company determined through consideration of market prices. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 3.

Therefore, as of March 31, 2024, the 2029 Notes have been included as Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.



The Company may not redeem the 2029 Notes prior to December 5, 2025. On or after December 5, 2025, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at the Company’s option, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and

including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company elects to redeem fewer than all of the outstanding 2029 Notes, at least $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date.



If a specified corporate event occurs, 2029 Note holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase any portion or all of their 2029 Notes in $1,000 principal increments for cash. The price for such repurchase is calculated as 100% of the principal amounts of 2029 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change repurchase date. Additionally, holders of the 2029 Notes who convert in connection with a fundamental change are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in conversion rate.



The 2029 Notes are general senior unsecured obligations that rank senior to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is explicitly subordinated to the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes have equal rank in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated to the 2029 Notes (including the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes). The 2029 Notes will be junior to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 



The estimated fair value of the 2029 Notes was approximately $25.8 million as of March 31, 2024, which the Company determined through consideration of market prices. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 3.



Certain Covenants for the Convertible Notes



Pursuant to the terms of the indentures that govern the Convertible Notes, the Company is required to file with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (the “Trustee”), as trustee under each of the indentures governing the Convertible Notes, within 15 days after the same are required to be filed with the SEC (giving effect to any grace period provided by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act), copies of any annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. To the extent the Company elects, the sole remedy for an event of default under the indenture governing a series of Convertible Notes relating to its failure to comply with this obligation (which shall occur upon failure by the Company for 60 days after receipt of written notice from the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount the Convertible Notes of such series to comply with this obligation) shall, for the first 360 days after the occurrence of such an event of default, consist exclusively of the right for the holders of Convertible Notes of such series to receive additional interest on their Convertible Notes at a rate equal to (i) 0.25% per year for each day during the first 180 days after the occurrence and during the continuance of such event of default and (ii) 0.50% per year for each day from, and including, the 181st day to, but excluding, the 360th day after the occurrence and during the continuance of such event of default. On the 361st day after such event of default, if not previously cured or waived, the Convertible Notes of the applicable series shall be subject to acceleration pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes of such series. In the event the Company does not elect to pay additional interest on a series of Convertible Notes prior to the occurrence of an event of default relating to the Company’s failure to comply with this obligation, or the Company elects to make such payment but does not pay the additional interest on such Convertible Notes when due, the Convertible Notes of such series shall be immediately subject to acceleration at the election of either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes of such series.



Additionally, if at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of a series of Convertible Notes, the Company fails to timely file any document or report that it is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable (after giving effect to all applicable grace period thereunder and other than reports on Form 8-K), or the Convertible Notes of such series are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Company shall pay additional interest on such Convertible Notes at a rate of 0.50% per year for each day during such period for which the Company’s failure to file has occurred and is continuing or such Convertible Notes are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144. Additional interest pursuant to the foregoing accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Notes from November 24, 2023 to the one-year anniversary of the last date of original issuance of the 2029 Notes on December 12, 2023 was not material. 



The Convertible Notes contain additional customary operating covenants, which include restrictions on the Company’s ability to undergo a merger or consolidation transaction, or transfer or lease substantially all of the consolidated properties and assets of the Company. The Convertible Notes do not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends, the issuance of other indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.

Capped Call Transactions



In connection with the issuance of each series of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are generally intended to reduce the potential dilution of the Company's common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the applicable series of Convertible Notes or to offset any cash payment the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable series of Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. If the market price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds the cap price of the applicable capped call transactions, then the Company’s stock would experience some dilution and/or such capped call transactions would not fully offset the potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent the then-market price per share of its common stock exceeds the applicable cap price. 



In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the convertible notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the convertible notes and with an initial cap price equal to $45.535, which represented a 75% premium over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock of $26.02 per share on March 4, 2021, with certain adjustments to the settlement terms that reflect standard anti-dilution provisions. The capped call transactions expire over 40 consecutive scheduled trading days ended on March 12, 2026. The capped calls were purchased for $16.1 million. 



In connection with the offering of the 2028 Notes, the Company purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate related to the total number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the 2028 Notes sold to the initial purchasers in the offering of 2028 Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the 2028 Notes and with an initial cap price equal to $82.62, which represents a 100% premium over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock of $41.31 per share on May 24, 2022, with certain adjustments to the settlement terms that reflect standard anti-dilution provisions. These capped call transactions expire over 40 consecutive scheduled trading days ended on May 30, 2028. The capped calls were purchased for $32.0 million, net of issuance costs.



In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, the Company purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate related to the total number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the 2029 Notes sold to the initial purchasers in the offering of 2029 Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the 2029 Notes and with an initial cap price equal to $99.21, which represents a 100% premium over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock of $49.66 per share on December 7, 2022, with certain adjustments to the settlement terms that reflect standard anti-dilution provisions. These capped call transactions expire over 40 consecutive scheduled trading days ended on May 30, 2029. The capped calls were purchased for $25.1 million, net of issuance costs.



The Company evaluated the capped call transactions under authoritative accounting guidance and determined that they should be accounted for as a separate transaction and classified as a net reduction to Additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity with no recurring fair value measurement recorded.

The Company early adopted ASU 2020-6, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) on January 1, 2021. In accordance with Subtopic 470-20 and 815-40, as revised by ASU 2020-6, the Company records the convertible notes in long-term debt with no separation between the Notes and the conversion option. Each reporting period, the Company will determine whether any criteria is met for the note holders to have the option to redeem the Notes early, which could result in a change in the classification of the Notes to current liabilities.

Debt Issuance Cost

The issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes. The issuance costs are amortized using an effective interest method basis over the term of the Convertible Notes. The effective interest rates on the 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes, and 2029 Notes are 2.98%, 2.82%, and 4.63%, respectively. Interest expense for the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, including the amortization of debt issuance cost, totaled approximately $3.5 million for both periods. 

Loan and Security Agreement

On July 9, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for a four-year secured revolving loan facility (“SVB Revolving Line of Credit”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0 million. The Revolving Line of Credit, originally set to mature on July 9, 2024, was terminated by the Company on April 3, 2024.

Note 14.     Segment Reporting

Segment reporting is based on the “management approach,” following the method that management organizes the Company’s reportable segments for which separate financial information is made available to, and evaluated regularly by, the chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who makes decisions on allocating resources and assessing performance. 

In the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded a realignment of its operating segments to further drive its long-term strategic objectives. At the direction of the CEO, management reorganized its management reporting structure and began to manage its operations under one segment structure. The CEO, in making operating decisions, reviews consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geography and product. All of the Company’s principal operations and decision-making functions are located in the U.S. Substantially all of the Company's long-lived assets are located in the U.S. 

The Company reassessed its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and determined it had one consolidated reportable segment beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2023. 

The following table presents a summary of revenue by geography and product category for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Executive Summary

Company Description 

The Company develops, manufactures, distributes, and markets energy-based product platforms for medical practitioners, enabling them to offer safe and effective treatments to their customers. In addition, the Company distributes third-party manufactured Secret systems and consumables. The Company currently markets the following system platforms: AviClear, enlighten, excel V/V+, excel HR, truSculpt, Secret PRO, Secret DUO Secret RF, xeo, and xeo+ — each of which enables medical practitioners to perform procedures including treatment for acne, body contouring, skin resurfacing and revitalization, hair and tattoo removal, removal of benign pigmented lesions, and vascular conditions. Several of the Company’s systems offer multiple hand pieces and applications, providing customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems.

The Company’s corporate headquarters and U.S. operations are located in Brisbane, California, where the Company conducts manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, regulatory, sales and marketing, service, and administrative activities. The Company also maintains regional distribution centers (“RDCs”) in selection locations across the U.S. These RDCs serve as

forward warehousing for systems and service parts in various geographies. The Company markets, sells, and services the Company’s products through direct sales and service employees in North America (including Canada), Australia, New Zealand, Austria, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Sales and services outside of these direct markets are made through a worldwide distributor network in over 38 countries. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Products and Services

The Company derives revenue from the sale of products and services. Product revenue includes revenue from the sale of systems, hand pieces, upgrade of systems, and leasing and direct sales of AviClear devices (collectively “Systems” revenue); replacement hand pieces, truSculpt cycle refills, truFlex cycle refills, AviClear treatment fees, and single use disposable tips applicable to Secret RF (collectively “Consumables” revenue); and the sale of third-party manufactured skincare products (“Skincare” revenue). A system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface, a laser and (or) an energy-based module, control system software and high voltage electronics, as well as one or more hand pieces. However, depending on the application, the laser or other energy-based module is sometimes contained in the hand piece, such as with the Company’s Pearl and Pearl Fractional applications, instead of within the console.

Several of the Company’s systems offer multiple hand pieces and applications, providing customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they choose and provides the Company with a source of additional Systems revenue.

The Secret systems are manufactured by ilooda Co. Ltd. (“ilooda”), and Company is the exclusive distributor for all systems sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom; the exclusive distributor for certain systems in France, and Spain; and the non-exclusive distributor for systems sold in Austria and Germany.

Skincare revenue related to the distribution of ZO’s skincare products in Japan. The skincare products were purchased from a third-party manufacturer and sold to medical offices and licensed physicians. On February 28, 2024, the Company and its Japanese subsidiary, Cutera KK, entered into a termination agreement with ZO, which terminated all agreements related to the distribution by the Company of ZO’s products in Japan. The Company acted as the principal in this arrangement, as the Company determined the price to charge customers for the skincare products and controlled the products before they were transferred to the customer.

Service revenue includes prepaid service contracts, and labor, time and material on out-of-warranty products.

Significant Business Trends

The Company believes that the ability to grow revenue will be primarily impacted by the following:

•capturing market share in the Acne space and capitalizing on the momentum in AviClear;

•continuing to expand the Company’s product offerings, both through internal development and sourcing from other vendors;

•ongoing investment in the Company’s global sales and marketing infrastructure;

•use of clinical results to support new aesthetic products and applications;

•enhanced luminary development and reference selling efforts (to develop a location where the Company’s products can be displayed and used to assist in selling efforts);

•customer demand for the Company’s products;

•consumer demand for the application of the Company’s products;

•marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties, as well as outside those specialties; and

•generating recurring revenue from the Company’s growing installed base of customers through the sale of system upgrades, services, hand piece refills, truSculpt cycles, skincare products and replacement tips for Secret RF products.

For a detailed discussion of the significant business trends impacting the Company’s business, please see the section titled “Results of Operations” below.

Factors that May Impact Future Performance

The Company’s industry is impacted by numerous competitive, regulatory and other significant factors. The Company’s industry is highly competitive and the Company’s future performance depends on the Company’s ability to compete successfully. Additionally, the Company’s future performance is dependent upon the ability to continue to expand the Company’s product offerings with innovative technologies, obtain regulatory clearances for the Company’s products, protect the proprietary technology of the products and manufacturing processes, manufacture the products cost-effectively, and 



36



Table of Contents 

successfully market and distribute the products in a profitable manner. If the Company fails to execute on the aforementioned initiatives, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.

The Company supports any reasonable action that helps ensure patient safety going forward. The Company has a robust, multi-functional process that reviews its promotional claims and materials to ensure they are truthful, not misleading, fair and balanced, and supported by sound scientific evidence.

A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact the Company’s future performance are provided in (1) the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 - Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and (2) other announcements the Company makes from time to time.

Risks and Uncertainties

The world is currently experiencing widespread inflation. Household budgets are tight and cash is generally being conserved and spent on essential items like housing, gas, food, clothing and healthcare. Given the inflationary environment, fewer funds may be spent on aesthetic treatments, which may translate into less demand for the Company's products and less revenue as a result.

The Company continues to assess whether any impairment of its goodwill or its long-lived assets has occurred and has determined that no charges were necessary during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor future conditions important to its assessment of potential impairment of its long-lived assets and goodwill.

In March 2023, Serendia, LLC (“Serendia”), filed patent infringement complaints against the Company with the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of six Serendia patents by the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems, which the Company distributes in the U.S. on behalf of ilooda Co. Ltd., a Korean company. The manufacturer of these products, ilooda, is obligated to defend the Company against these claims and, as a result, the Company has not incurred significant external legal costs. Serendia and ilooda have agreed to a settlement of the ITC investigation, the Delaware litigation and any other past, present and future suits or claims related to the six Serendia patents and the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems. The settlement of these matters includes a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid up license from Serendia to ilooda to the six Serendia patents related to the Secret RF and Secret Pro systems, which are distributed by the Company. The ITC investigation as to ilooda and the Company was terminated as of April 10, 2024 and the Delaware litigation was dismissed as of April 3, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes requires the Company to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company has based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company periodically reviews its estimates and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, its financial condition or results of operations will be affected.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that its critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its audited consolidated financial statements. 

The accounting policies and estimates that the Company considers to be critical, subjective, and requiring judgment in their application are summarized in “Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on May 10, 2024. There have been no new or material changes to the significant accounting policies discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K that are of significance, or potential significance, to the Company.



The Company established new accounting policies to account for the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and, together with the 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes, the “Convertible Notes”) and related transactions during the first quarter of 2021.

In March 2021, the Company issued $138.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes in a private placement offering. In May 2022, the Company issued $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes in a private placement offering. In

Table of Contents 

December 2022, the Company issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes in a private placement offering. The notes issued in March 2021 and May 2022 each bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per year and the notes issued in December 2022 bear interest at 4.00% per year. In accordance with ASU 2020-06, the Company recorded the Convertible Notes in long-term debt with no separation between the notes and the conversion option. Each reporting period, the Company will determine whether any criteria are met for the note holders to have the option to redeem the notes early. To the extent there are any conversion requests, the Company intends to settle such conversion requests in shares of common stock. Therefore, the convertible notes have been included as Long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes. See Note 13. Debt of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Revenue

The timing of the Company’s revenue is significantly affected by the mix of system products, training, consumables and extended service contracts. The revenue generated in any given period is also impacted by whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time. For an additional description on revenue, see Note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements on the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 7 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item I, Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time. Revenue from performance obligations that are transferred to customers over time accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of the Company’s total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue recognized over time relates to revenue from the Company’s extended service contracts and marketing services. Revenue recognized upon delivery is primarily generated by the sales of systems, consumables and skincare.

The Company’s total net revenue decreased by $15.7 million, or 29%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a $10.3 million decline in Systems revenue, as well as a $1.8 million decline in Consumables revenue, and a $3.9 million decrease in Skincare revenue due to the early termination of distribution agreement on the Company's Japanese Skincare business. 

Revenue by Geography

The Company’s North America revenue decreased by $8.8 million, or 32%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to higher interest rates related to financing system purchases by customers.

Revenue in Japan decreased by $5.3 million, or 41%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. On February 28, 2024, the Company entered into a termination agreement with ZO, which terminated all agreements related to the distribution by the Company of ZO’s products in Japan, as disclosed in Note. 1 under Distribution of Third-Party Products.

Company’s Rest of World revenue decreased by $1.6 million, or 11%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, driven by system softness in all geographies, specifically in global distributor markets. 

Revenue by Product Type

Systems Revenue

Systems revenue in North America decreased by $7.3 million, or 38%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher interest rates related to financing system purchases by customers and the macroeconomic conditions in North America, which resulted in a decrease in both unit volumes and average selling prices (“ASPs”). System revenue in the Rest of the World (including Japan) decreased by $3.0 million, or 19%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, for the same reason. 

Consumables Revenue

Consumables revenue decreased by $1.8 million mainly due to an industry-wide slow down.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s principal source of liquidity in the three months ended March 31, 2024, was its cash on hand. The Company actively manages its cash usage to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. banks. The Company's foreign subsidiaries maintain a limited amount of cash in their local banks to cover short-term operating expenses.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $162.5 million and $181.4 million of working capital, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable investments decreased by $38.2 million to $105.4 million as of March 31, 2024, from $143.6 million as of December 31, 2023, driven by net loss adjusted for non-cash items of $14.5 million, changes in assets and liabilities of $23.1 million, and capital expenditures of $0.3 million.

When preparing financial statements, management has the responsibility to evaluate if the Company has adequate liquidity to continue to operate for the next twelve months. In performing this assessment, management considered the Company's current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds, forecasted future cash flows and unconditional obligations due over the next twelve months. In addition, management evaluated the history of the Company's financial performance, and determined that the Company has had a historic trend of operating losses, which continues to have an unfavorable impact on the Company's overall liquidity. Most recently, the Company reported net losses of $22.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $162.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company’s continued operations will depend on several factors, including but not limited to, growth of revenues from its revised business model for AviClear, maintaining or increasing revenues from sales of legacy systems, consumables and services, achieving cost savings as a result of workforce reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023, restructuring of supplier and manufacturing relationships, and initiatives to improve inventory and receivables management. Failure to increase revenue, achieve cost savings, raise additional financing or re-finance the existing convertible notes when they become due, would adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. There can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, and delays may occur in completing the operating activities.

The Company intends to continue to evaluate market conditions and may in the future pursue additional sources of funding to enhance its financial position and to execute on its business strategy. In addition, should prevailing economic, financial, business or other factors adversely affect its ability to meet its operating cash requirements, the Company could be required to obtain funding though the credit or capital markets. Any equity financing obtained by the Company would dilute existing stockholders and any debt financing could contain restrictive covenants, which would reduce management’s flexibility to run the Company’s business or present a risk of default. If the Company raises funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, the Company may be required to relinquish significant rights to its technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the Company. The Company cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to it on favorable terms when required, or at all.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $37.6 million, which mainly reflected the net loss adjusted for non-cash items of $14.5 million and a payment of $18.7 million associated with the non-renewal of the manufacturing services agreement with Jabil Inc. in February 2024.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, which represents the Company's capital expenditures. The net cash provided in the comparable period in 2023 was primarily the net proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by the capital expenditure related to the manufacture of the AviClear device.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was primarily due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and finance lease payments. 

Adequacy of Cash Resources to Meet Future Needs

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $105.4 million as of March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s principal source of liquidity was cash on hand. The Company has reported operating losses in recent quarters and intends to use its remaining cash resources to develop plans and take proactive steps to grow revenue and enhance its operations as further explained in the preceding Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

The Company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued.

Debt

In March 2021, the Company issued $138.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes in a private placement offering. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per year payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. Upon conversion, the 2026 Notes will be convertible into either cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. The convertible notes are presented as convertible notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The aggregate proceeds from the offering were approximately $133.6 million, net of issuance costs, including initial purchaser fees.

In May 2022, the Company issued $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes. A total of $230.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes was issued in a private placement offering and concurrently with this private placement, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Voce Capital Management LLC, an entity affiliated with J. Daniel Plants, the Company’s former Executive Chairperson, pursuant to which the Company issued to Voce $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes on the same terms and conditions. The aggregate proceeds from the offering of 2028 Notes were approximately $232.4 million, net of issuance costs, including initial purchaser fees.

In December 2022, the Company issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes in a private placement offering. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Upon conversion, the 2029 Notes will be convertible into either cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. The Convertible notes are presented as Convertible notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, on the consolidated balance sheet. The aggregate proceeds from the offering were approximately $115.8 million, net of issuance costs, including initial purchaser fees.

The Company's Loan and Security Agreement for the Revolving Line of Credit, which was entered on July 9, 2020, was terminated by the Company on April 3, 2024.

Commitments and Contingencies

As of the date of this report, there were no material changes to the Company’s contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business since May 10, 2024, the filing date of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

A summary of the key market risks facing the Company is disclosed below. For a detailed discussion, please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on May 10, 2024, and other announcements the Company makes from time to time.

The conditional conversion feature of the Company's convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.

The Company has outstanding the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, and the 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029. During any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2021, in the case of the 2026 Notes, ending on September 30, 2022, in the case of the 2028 Notes, and ending on March 31, 2023, in the case of the 2029 Notes, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of conversion price for the applicable series of Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day then holders may convert their notes in the subsequent quarter. This condition was not met for any of the Company’s Convertible Notes in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Upon any future conversion requests of the Convertible Notes, the Company would be required to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election with respect to such conversion requests.

Interest Rate and Market Risk

On April 3, 2024, the Loan and Security Agreement for the Revolving Line of Credit was terminated by the Company. The Company does not have any line of credit facility as of March 31, 2024.

Inflation

The Company has experienced inflationary pressure on its business. If the Company’s costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, the Company may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. The Company’s inability or failure to do so could harm the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Foreign Exchange Fluctuations

The Company generates revenue in Japanese Yen, Euros, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, and Swiss Francs. Additionally, a portion of the Company’s operating expenses, and assets and liabilities are denominated in each of these currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in these currencies against the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations upon translation of the Company’s revenue denominated in these currencies, as well as the re-measurement of the Company’s international subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management identified material weaknesses in the year ended December 31, 2023, over the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. These material weaknesses are related to information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) including, segregation of duties, user access, and reports produced by certain IT systems that support the Company's financial reporting process including those related to the implementation of an ERP system; inventory controls related to the completeness, existence, and cut-off of inventories held at third parties, inventories held by sales personnel, and inventories in transit, and controls related to the calculation of adjustments to inventory for items considered excessive and obsolete; the completeness and accuracy of expense for routine and non-routine equity-based awards; and failure to design, maintain and monitor a risk assessment program at a sufficiently precise level to identify new and evolving risks related to accounting policies, procedures and related controls performed over areas including, but not limited to inventory, revenues and lease income, costs for leased devices, and testing of certain key reports used in controls. Although certain of these material weaknesses did not result in any 



44



Table of Contents 

material misstatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management concluded that these deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weaknesses in internal controls, which were disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in the Form 10-Q, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Remediation Plans

Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over ITGCs, inventory, equity and its risk assessment program over areas including but not limited to inventory, revenues and lease income, costs for leased devices, and certain key reports used in controls. The Company has added internal and external resources to its finance and internal audit functions to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. 

The Company’s efforts include:

ITGC remediation actions:

•Developed a training program addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting financial reporting;

•Developed enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in IT systems;

•Implemented an IT management review and testing plan to monitor ITGCs with focus on systems supporting the financial reporting processes;

Inventory control remediation actions:

•Evaluated the effectiveness of the current annual inventory count program and controls;

•Implemented a global inventory count policy and standard operating procedures to ensure consistent communication of the inventory count process and adherence to these policies at facilities managed by the Company and third-party logistics service providers;

•Provided training of standard operating procedures and internal controls to key stakeholders within the supply chain, logistics, and inventory process; and

•Enhanced existing management review controls related to inventory reconciliation, inventory in transit, inventories held by sales personnel, and key reports used in in the inventory count process. Evaluating the effectiveness of the current annual inventory count program and controls.

Equity-based awards expense calculation remediation actions:

• Enhanced current review controls around the calculation of stock-based compensation expense.

Risk assessment remediation actions: 

•Engaged third-party professionals to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's risk assessment process in relation to the timely identification and assessment of changes in the business and leadership; and

•Provided training of standard operating procedures and internal controls to key stakeholders.

The actions the Company is taking are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to audit committee oversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses, or if in the future, the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis, and its condensed financial statements may be materially misstated.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except for the remediation measures in connection with the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the Company’s disclosure control system are met.
