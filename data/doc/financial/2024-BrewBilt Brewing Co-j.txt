BREWBILT BREWING COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 2024

(Unaudited)

 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Organization and Description of Business

 

BrewBilt Brewing Company, a Florida Corporation, wholly owns BrewBilt Brewing LLC, a California Limited Liability Corporation located in the Sierra Foothills of Northern California. BrewBilt Brewing LLC is a Type 23 licensed brewery with the California Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC). The Company began building its first processing brewery in 2021 and started delivering its craft beers in July of 2022.

 

The Company opened the BrewBilt BrewHaus taproom and restaurant in Nevada City, CA in December 2023. The establishment seats 140 people and serves lunch and dinner six days a week, plus brunch on Sundays, along with the full lineup of BrewBilt beers and guest wines, ciders, kombuchas, and non-alcoholic beverages. 

 

BrewBilt Brewing is devoted to the modern execution of traditional styles utilizing hand-crafted, industry-leading equipment combined with an artful approach and a passion for quality. A focus on regionally sourced local ingredients gives the company its dynamic palette for distinctly satisfying beers. Inspired by European brewing tradition and American craft innovation, BrewBilt Brewing creates craft beers that reflect a sense of place in order to share their brewing philosophy for the ultimate drinking pleasure.

 

Among all craft breweries, BrewBilt Brewing is unique in its exclusive use of small-batch craft malt that is grown in the nearby Sacramento Valley. In addition to the flavor benefits of this superior product, BrewBilt’s intentional material sourcing reduces the Company’s carbon footprint and sustains local agriculture. Even after brewing with these grains, BrewBilt implements eco-friendly practices such as upcycling the spent grain to local ranchers to use as high-quality animal feed.

 

Financial Statement Presentation 

 

The unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Reclassification

 

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

 

Fiscal Year End 

 

The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of assets and liabilities.

 

Management bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates include:

 

     ■    Liability for legal contingencies.

 

     ■    Useful life of assets.

 

     ■    Deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances.

 

     ■    Impairment of fixed assets.

 

     ■    Obsolescence of inventory.

 

     ■    Stock-based compensation calculated using the lattice pricing model.

Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

 

Advertising Costs

 

The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total advertising costs were $22,510 and $1,946 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Leases

 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” Topic 842, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard increases transparency and comparability most significantly by requiring the recognition by lessees of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases longer than 12 months. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For lessees, leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.

 

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

 

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2018.

 

Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

 

We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:

 

     ●    identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

           

     ●    identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

           

     ●    determination of the transaction price;

           

     ●    allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

           

     ●    recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

           

If the conditions for revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers the revenue and related cost of sales until all conditions are met. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has deferred revenue of $13,108 and $6,270, respectively.

 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Bad debts and allowances are provided based on historical experience and management’s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. Management evaluates past due or delinquency of accounts receivable based on the open invoices aged on a due date basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is $0.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the fiscal year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.

 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share

 

In accordance with ASC Topic 280 – “Earnings Per Share”, the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the number of diluted shares that have been excluded are 123,532,851,804 and 18,394,404,525, respectively.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories consist of raw materials, beer cans and labels, keg collars and toppers, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, direct labor, depreciation, overhead, and finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has inventory of $59,472 and $51,706, respectively. Inventories consist of the following:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 

The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then these assets are written down first, followed by other long-lived assets of the operation to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no impairment losses recognized for long-lived assets.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.

9

 

In addition to defining fair value, the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs is expanded. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, and which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

 

These levels are:

 

Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.

 

Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

 

Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

 

The following table represents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for each fair value hierarchy level:

In management’s opinion, the fair value of convertible notes payable and advances payable is approximate to carrying value as the interest rates and other features of these instruments approximate those obtainable for similar instruments in the current market. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, exchange or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balances reported for cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.

 

Debt issuance costs and debt discounts

 

Debt issuance costs and debt discounts are being amortized over the lives of the related financings on a basis that approximates the effective interest method. Costs and discounts are presented as a reduction of the related debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company records deferred taxes in accordance with FASB ASC No. 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As of the date of this filing, the Company is not current in filing their tax returns. The last return filed by the Company was December 31, 2017, and the Company has not accrued any potential penalties or interest from that period forward.  The Company will need to file returns for the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018, which are still open for examination.

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 

Although there were new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and through the date of filing of this report, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

2. GOING CONCERN

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has a shareholders’ deficit of $34,509,958 since its inception, working capital deficit of $16,850,667, negative cash flows from operations, and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable is dependent on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing or achieve a profitable level of operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in achieving these goals.

 

The Company does not have sufficient cash to fund its desired business objectives for its production and marketing for the next 12 months. The Company has arranged financing and intends to utilize the cash received to fund the production and marketing of more beers. This financing may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements required to complete the product design for the augmented/virtual reality markets. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in completing any new product development. The Company plans to seek additional funding if necessary, in private or public equity offering(s) to secure future funding for operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in raising additional funding. If the Company is not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of the Company’s business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all.

 

These financial statements do not give effect to adjustments to the amounts and classification to assets and liabilities that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

3. PREPAID EXPENSES

 

Prepaid fees represent amounts paid in advance for future contractual benefits to be received. Expenses paid in advance are recorded as a prepaid asset and then amortized to the statements of operations when services are rendered, or over the life of the contract using the straight-line method.

 

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid expenses consisted of the following:

7. LEASES

 

The Company adopted the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition approach, applying the new standard to all of its leases existing at the date of initial application which is the effective date of adoption. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. We elected the package of practical expedients which permits us to not reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) any initial direct costs for any existing leases as of the effective date. We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient which permits entities to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment. The adoption of the lease standard did not change our previously reported consolidated statements of operations and did not result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening equity.

 

The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In calculating the present value of the lease payments, the Company elected to utilize its incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease terms as of the January 1, 2019 adoption date.

 

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Our leases have remaining lease terms from 2 years to 4.5 years.

 

The Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. The lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, current operating lease liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities.

 

The new standard also provides practical expedients and certain exemptions for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases where the initial lease term is one year or less or for which the ROU asset at inception is deemed immaterial, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. Those leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023

 

Revenues:

 

The Company’s revenues were $341,256 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $76,856 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Revenues in Q1 2024 comprised of $122,532 in beer sales, $217,815 in taproom sales and $909 in merchandise sales. The primary increase was due to sales from the taproom which opened in December 2023. In addition, in Q1 2024, can sales increased 49% and keg sales increased 69% compared to Q1 2023. The increase in revenue is due to customer expansion through advertising and additional distribution options.

 

Cost of Sales:

 

The Company’s cost of sales was $235,406 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $106,360 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cost of sales in 2023 included raw materials, beer packaging, selling expenses, depreciation of the brewing equipment, direct labor expenses, overhead expenses and food and beverage costs for the taproom. The average cost per barrel was $138 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $148 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cost per barrel in Q1 2024 decreased due to an increase in beer production which has resulted in volume discounts on packaging and materials. In addition, there are costs that remain constant regardless of the amount of beer that is produced, such as rent, depreciation and direct labor.

 

Operating Expenses:

 

Operating expenses consisted primarily of consulting fees, professional fees, salaries, and wages, share based compensation, office expenses and fees associated with preparing reports and SEC filings relating to being a public company. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, were $451,425 and $1,187,559, respectively. Although there was an increase in depreciation expense and G&A expenses in Q1 2024, there was a decrease in wages due to share based compensation in connection with directors’ agreements issued in Q1 2023.

 

Other Income (Expense):

 

Other income (expense) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was $409,462 and $(1,499,769), respectively. Other expense consisted of derivative valuation gains and losses, gains or losses on settlement of debt and conversion of debt, and interest expense. The gain or loss on derivative valuation is directly attributable to the change in fair value of the derivative liability. Interest expense is primarily attributable to interest and penalties on outstanding notes payable, the initial interest expense associated with the valuation of derivative instruments at issuance, and the accretion of the convertible debentures over their respective terms. The variance is due to losses on conversion of debt of $1,906,732 and an increase in amortization of debt discounts during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

 

Net Profit (Loss):

 

Net profit (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $63,887 compared to $(2,716,832) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in profit in Q1 2024 can be explained by the increase in gross profit, a decrease in share-based compensation, and a decrease in other expenses.

 

Impact of Inflation

 

We believe that the rate of inflation has had a negligible effect on our operations.

                                                                                                       2024               2023

Current Liabilities                                                                                    16,991,372         17,419,790 

Working Capital (Deficit)                                                                         $   (16,850,667)   $   (17,211,720)

 

The overall working capital deficit decreased from $17,211,720 at December 31, 2023 to $16,850,667 at March 31, 2024 due to a decrease in derivative liabilities, accrued expenses and related party liabilities.

 

                                                                                                          March 31,        March 31,   

                                                                                                             2024             2023     

Cash Flows (used in) provided by Operating Activities                                                       (224,562)       (131,309)

Cash Flows (used in) provided by Investing Activities                                                         (9,081)        (10,632)

Cash Flows (used in) provided by Financing Activities                                                        141,336         114,739 

Net Increase (decrease) in Cash During Period                                                                (92,307)        (27,202)

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 cash used in operating activities was $224,562 compared to $131,309 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. In Q1 2024, the company had increases in accrued interest and accounts payable and decreases in share-based compensation and losses on conversion of debt compared to Q1 2023.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 cash used in investing activities was $9,081 compared to $10,632 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The additions in Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 were leaseholder improvements for the taproom.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $141,336 compared to $114,739, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activity primarily resulted from an increase in proceeds from promissory notes during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance and current asset total of $22,195 and $140,705 respectively, compared with $114,502 and $208,070 of cash and current assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in assets was due to an increase in cash expenditures for the taproom which opened in December 2023.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had total current liabilities of $16,991,372 compared with $17,419,790 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in current liabilities was primarily attributed to a decrease in derivative liabilities and related party liabilities.

 

Going Concern

 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. Since its inception, the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing funds.

 

As of March 31, 2024 we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our December 31, 2023 audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

 

Future Financings

 

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.

32

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

 

Contractual Obligations

 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

We are a non-accelerated filer and a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and as such, are not required to provide the information under this item.

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Company’s officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Company’s officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that was filed with the SEC on April 5, 2024, the Company’s officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II- OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

The Company was served a complaint in the County of Nevada, State of California (Case No. CU0000567). BrewBilt Brewing Co. is listed as a named defendant in this matter. The complaint involves the termination of employee Branford Samuels who was employed as a fabricator for BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. and, it is not uncommon for named defendants in a civil matter to be listed, but never served the complaint, and eventually they are dismissed from the matter without further steps being taken by a plaintiff(s). California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b) states in relevant part that, “[t]he complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days of filing of the complaint.” The subject complaint was filed by plaintiff on February 7, 2023. Therefore, at this time it is speculative whether BrewBilt Brewing Co. has any threat of material litigation or pending material litigation. To the extent that one considers being a named defendant of a complaint as a threatened or pending matter, we have not devoted substantial attention to this matter, and do not anticipate doing so in the future with the facts known to us. Although though the underlying events giving rising to the claim/cause of action occurred prior to the date of December 31, 2022, at this time, it is our current opinion that there are no unasserted possible claims or assessments of such that are probable as it relates to BrewBilt Brewing Co. In other words, with facts known to us at this time, we opine that it is not “probable” (Standard 8(a)) that there are assertable legal claims against BrewBilt Brewing Co. that must be disclosed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 as they do not also likely satisfy Standard 8(b): “The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.”
