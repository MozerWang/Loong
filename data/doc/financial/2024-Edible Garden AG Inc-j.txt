EDIBLE GARDEN AG, INCORPORATED

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Organization and Recent Developments

 

Edible Garden Corp., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on April 9, 2013. On March 28, 2020, Edible Garden Inc., a Wyoming corporation, was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring substantially all of the operating assets of Edible Garden Corp., which was a separately identified reportable segment of its parent company Blum Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Terra Tech Corporation). The acquisition was completed on March 30, 2020. Prior to March 30, 2020 Edible Garden AG Incorporated had no operations. Hereafter, Edible Garden AG Incorporated and its subsidiaries will collectively be referred to as “Edible Garden,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Successor.” Edible Garden Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Blum Holdings, Inc. will be referred to as the “Predecessor.” Throughout these financial statements, the Successor and the Predecessor are also referred to as “the Company” and used interchangeably, unless otherwise noted.

 

We authorized 100,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“common stock”), at formation. On October 14, 2020, we simultaneously declared a 20-for-1 forward stock split of our common stock and increased the number of authorized common shares to 20,000,000. On June 30, 2021, we simultaneously (1) converted Edible Garden from a Wyoming into a Delaware corporation, (2) declared a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our common stock, and (3) increased the total number of authorized common shares to 50,000,000. On September 8, 2021, we simultaneously declared a 20-for-1 forward stock split of our common stock and increased the number of authorized common shares to 200,000,000. On January 18, 2022, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, which became effective on May 3, 2022. On January 26, 2023, we effected a reverse stock split of 1-for-30 and decreased the total number of authorized common shares to 6,666,667. On June 8, 2023, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 6,666,667 shares to 10,000,000 shares.

 

On November 10, 2023, we increased the total number of authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from 20,000,000 to 110,000,000 and increased the total authorized shares of common stock from 10,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares. On April 5, 2024, we declared a  1-for-20 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The conversion or exercise prices of our issued and outstanding stock options and warrants were adjusted in connection with the reverse stock split. 

 

All historical share and per share amounts reflected throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock splits described above.

 

Nature of Business

 

Edible Garden is a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, nutraceuticals and hot sauce, which is distributed throughout the Northeast and Midwest. Currently, Edible Garden’s products are sold at over 5,000 supermarkets. Our target customers are those individuals seeking fresh produce locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods.

 

Basis of Presentation

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The December 31, 2023 balances reported herein are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

 

 

                                                                   7



Table of Content

   

 

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 have been included. 

 

Going Concern 

 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. In an effort to achieve liquidity that would be sufficient to meet all of our commitments, the Company may seek funding through additional debt or equity financing arrangements, implement incremental expense reduction measures or a combination thereof to continue financing its operations. 

 

However, we believe that even after taking these actions, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our future financial obligations. The risks and uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue our business with limited capital resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 11, “Going Concern” for additional information.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to Be Adopted in Future Periods

 

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 primarily require entities to disclose certain significant segment expenses and other segment items on both an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statement disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2025.

 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU and expect to adopt this ASU for the year ending December 31, 2025.

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

 

Examples of significant estimates and assumptions include provisions for doubtful accounts, accrued liabilities, discount rates used in the measurement and recognition of lease liabilities and valuation of our warrants. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require us to make judgments, involving an analysis of historical and future trends, that can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

 

 

                                                                   8



Table of Content

   

 

Trade Receivables

 

The Company extends non-interest-bearing trade credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business which is not collateralized. Accounts receivable are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheets net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company analyzes the aging of accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends, in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company does not accrue interest receivable on past due accounts receivable. The reserve for credit losses was $146,080 and $136,858 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, three customers accounted for approximately 78.7% and 69.0% of our total revenue, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 76.0% of our gross outstanding trade receivables were attributed to three customers, 41.0% of which was due from one customer. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 80.4% of our gross outstanding trade receivables were attributed to four customers, 41.1% of which was due from one customer.

 

This concentration of customers leaves us exposed to the risks associated with the loss of one or more of these significant customers, which would materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

 

Inventory

 

We value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory, as determined using the first-in, first-out method, or its net realizable value. We periodically review our physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserve accordingly. Our reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is based on expected future use. Our reserve estimates have historically been consistent with our actual experience as evidenced by actual sale or disposal of the goods. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was not material as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 

Prepaid Expenses

 

Prepaid expenses consist of various payments that the Company has made in advance for goods or services to be received in the future. These prepaid expenses include advertising, insurance, and service or other contracts requiring up-front payments. 

 

Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net

 

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our fixed assets, which are comprised of leasehold improvements, equipment and vehicles, have useful lives of five years.

 

Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the asset lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying balances of its property, equipment and leasehold improvements may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. See Note 4, “Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net” for further information.

 

Intangible Assets

 

Intangible assets continue to be subject to amortization, and any impairment is determined in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” Intangible assets are stated at historical cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company uses a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined.

 

 

                                                                   9



Table of Content

   

 

The Company reviews intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset (asset group), the Company will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period the impairment is identified.

 

Revenue Recognition and Performance Obligations

 

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company does not offer returns, discounts, loyalty programs or other sales incentive programs that are material to revenue recognition. Payments from our customers are due upon delivery or within a short period after delivery.

Contract Balances

 

Due to the nature of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers, the Company does not have material contract assets or liabilities that fall under the scope of ASC Topic 606.

 

Contract Estimates and Judgments

 

On January 1, 2024, the Company and Meijer Distribution, Inc. (“Buyer”) entered into two agreements pursuant to which the Company will supply and sell products to Buyer (the “Agreements”). Under the Agreements, the Company will sell (i) fresh cut herbs, including basil, bay leaves, chives, cilantro, dill, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme; (ii) hydroponic basil; and (iii) potted herbs, including basil, chives, cilantro, mint, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, wheatgrass; in quantities and delivery schedule requested by the Buyer at prices per unit set in advance by the Company and the Buyer. Under the Agreements, the Company and the Buyer will renegotiate the prices for each unit annually, provided that the price per unit will not increase or decrease at a rate greater than the change in the relevant Consumer Price Index in that year. Once set, the pricing terms will remain fixed for the remainder of the year. Any price increases will take effect after sixty days and any price decrease will be effective immediately. If the Company and the Buyer are unable to mutually agree on price increases, the Company will have the power to terminate the Agreements immediately.

 

 

                                                                   10

In addition, under the agreement governing the purchase of potted herbs, the Company has agreed to fund the installation of fixtures in each of the Buyer’s stores to display the potted herbs in an aggregate amount estimated to be approximately $806,947. These payments will be made as a weekly deduction from the Company’s receivables from the Buyer.

 

The Agreements became effective as of January 1, 2024 and expire on December 31, 2026. The Agreements may be renewed for an additional two-year term upon the mutual agreement of the Company and the Buyer. The Agreements may be terminated by the Buyer without cause upon sixty days’ prior notice.

 

Management has determined the payments for the fixtures should be treated as a reduction in revenue under the guidance of ASC 606. As we do not expect the agreement to be terminated before the end of the three-year term, the aggregate cost of the fixtures of approximately $806,947 will be treated as a reduction in the transaction price of products sold to the Buyer during the three year term of the contract. 

 

Cost of Goods Sold

 

Cost of goods sold includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in cultivating, producing, and shipping our products. 

 

Advertising Expenses

 

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, “Other Expenses – Advertising Cost.” During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, advertising expenses totaled $34,571 and $26,727, respectively. 

 

Loss Per Common Share

 

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. During a loss period, the effect of the potential exercise of stock options, warrants, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt are not considered in the diluted loss per share calculation since the effect would be anti-dilutive. The results of operations were a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Therefore, the basic and diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding were the same for all periods.

 

Income Taxes

 

The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return. The Company provides for income taxes based on enacted tax law and statutory tax rates at which items of income and expense are expected to be settled in our income tax return. Certain items of revenue and expense are reported for Federal income tax purposes in different periods than for financial reporting purposes, thereby resulting in deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has incurred net operating losses for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, such net operating losses were offset entirely by a valuation allowance.

 

The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50.0% likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. The Company classifies income tax related interest and penalties as interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations.

Segment Reporting

 

The Company is not organized by multiple operating segments for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment. The Company’s principal decision makers are the Chief Executive Officer and its Interim Chief Financial Officer. Management believes that its business operates as one reportable segment because: a) the Company measures profit and loss as a whole; b) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment; c) the Company does not maintain discrete financial information on any specific segment; d) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services, and e) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas.

On June 8, 2023 the stockholders of the Company approved the First Amendment to the 2022 Plan, which increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder by 15,000 shares and extended the term of the 2022 Plan until June 8, 2033.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 6,000 restricted stock awards to employees and consultants of the Company as compensation. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $38,280 for the awards, which vested immediately. 

 

Shares available for future stock compensation grants totaled 9,957 at March 31, 2024.

 

Warrants

 

There was no warrant activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Total outstanding warrants of 179,345 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 have a weighted-average exercise price per share of $133.65. 

 

NOTE 9 – LEASES

 

A lease provides the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right-of-use assets (“Lease Assets”) are included within “Other Assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

 

Lease Assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease Assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

 

The discount rate used to determine the commencement date present value of lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease, or when that is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its secured borrowing rate. Lease Assets include any lease payments required to be made prior to commencement and exclude lease incentives. Both Lease Assets and lease liabilities exclude variable payments not based on an index or rate, which are treated as period costs. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain significant residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants.

 

We are currently party to an ongoing arrangement with our predecessor company, Edible Garden Corp., whereby we make lease payments of approximately $21,860 per month to the lessor of the land on which our flagship facility is built and for which our predecessor company is the lessee. Our month-to-month arrangement meets the definition of a short-term lease and is therefore excluded from the recognition requirements of ASC 842, “Leases”.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, total operating lease cost was $73,445, of which $46,685 was associated with short-term leases. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, total operating lease cost was $75,170, of which $48,410 was associated with short-term leases. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, short term lease liabilities of $8,791 and $34,415 are included within “Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses” on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively.

NOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

 

Effective January 25, 2024, Michael James retired from his positions as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Company. In connection with Mr. James’s retirement, on January 24, 2024, the Company and Mr. James entered into a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr. James a severance payment of $300,000 in the form of salary continuation until January 2025. In addition, Mr. James is eligible to earn milestone payments under the Separation Agreement in an aggregate amount up to $300,000 if he completes certain transitional deliverables for the Company. The Company granted Mr. James a restricted stock award with a fair value equal to $25,000 as of April 2, 2024. 

 

As described in detail in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” on February 8, 2024, the Company entered into two agreements with the Buyer to supply and sell products over a three-year period. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will pay approximately $806,947 to the Buyer for product displays and fixtures during 2024. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company funded $329,290 of this commitment.

 

From time to time, we may be party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that there is any pending or threatened proceeding against us, which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

 

 

                                                                   20

NOTE 11 – GOING CONCERN

 

These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Company began operating in 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $4.0 million. We expect to experience further significant net losses in the foreseeable future. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash available for operations of $0.4 million. We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. Since our inception, we have raised capital through our issuance of debt and equity securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations.

 

We will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements until we are able to raise revenue and reduce costs to a point of positive cash flow. We are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including obtaining loans and selling securities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations, or if we are able to raise capital, that it will be available to us on acceptable terms, on an acceptable schedule, or at all.

 

The issuance of additional securities may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining loans, assuming these loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations or that additional financing will be available for use when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.

 

The risks and uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue raise capital and to continue our business with limited capital resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 

 

NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

On May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated standard merchant cash advance agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Cedar, dated as of May 3, 2024, that amends and restates the Cedar Agreement. Under the Restated Agreement, the Company sold to Cedar an additional $994,000 of its future accounts receivable for a purchase price of $700,000, less aggregate fees and expenses of $87,500, for additional net funds provided of $544,250, bringing the total financing with Cedar to $2,485,000 in accounts receivable sold for $1,544,250 of net funds provided. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, we are required to pay Cedar 35.0% of all funds collected weekly from customers and Cedar is expected to withdraw $65,000 a week directly from the Company’s bank account until the $2,485,000 due to Cedar under the Restated Agreement is paid in full. Except as amended by the Restated Agreement, the remaining terms of the Cedar Agreement remain in full force and effect.

 

 

                                                                   21

OVERVIEW

 

We are a controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) farming company. We use traditional agricultural growing techniques together with technology to grow fresh, organic food, sustainably and safely while improving traceability. We use the controlled environment of traditional greenhouse structures, such as glass greenhouses, together with hydroponic and vertical greenhouses to sustainably grow organic herbs, lettuces and floral products. In our hydroponic greenhouse, we grow plants without soil. Instead of planting one row of lettuce in the ground, by using a vertical greenhouse, we can grow many towers of lettuce in the same area by planting up instead of planting across. Growing these products sustainably means that we avoid depleting natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance, such as by renewing, reusing and recycling materials in order to lower the overall one-time use of materials.

 

Our controlled greenhouse facilities allow us to grow consistent quality herbs and lettuces year-round, first by eliminating some of the variability of outdoor farming with our CEA techniques, and second by leveraging our proprietary software, GreenThumb. In addition to using hydroponic and vertical greenhouse systems, we use a “closed loop” system in our greenhouses. Generally, in a “closed loop” system, drain water is recollected and reused for irrigation. In our closed loop system, we also cycle water back into the system that has been collected through reverse osmosis. When compared with conventional agriculture, our closed looped systems and hydroponic methods use less land, less energy and less water (than legacy farms), thus conserving some of the planet’s limited natural resources. Our advanced systems are also designed to help mitigate contamination from harmful pathogens, including salmonella, e-coli and others.

 

We have also developed patented software called GreenThumb that assists in tracking plants through our supply chain. Utilizing our GreenThumb software to track the status of our plants as they grow and move throughout the greenhouse allows us to add a layer of quality control due to the frequent monitoring of the growing process, leading to improved traceability. In this context, traceability means being able to track a plant through all stages of production and distribution. In addition to improving traceability, GreenThumb helps us better manage the day-to-day operations of our business. GreenThumb is a web-based greenhouse management and demand planning system that does the following:

 

   •     integrates in real-time with our cloud business software suite for monitoring daily sales data;

   •     generates reports by category, product, customer, and farm to allow us to analyze sales, trends, margins and retail shrink

          (spoiled

          product);

   •     provides dynamic pallet mapping for packout, which enables us to more efficiently ship our products;

   •     utilizes a proprietary algorithm that uses year-over-year and trending sales data to develop customer specific and aggregate

          product specific forecasting for our

          greenhouses;

   •     aggregates all greenhouse activity input to provide real-time inventory and availability reports of all products in our

          greenhouses;

   •     manages our online ordering system with user controlled product availability based upon greenhouse inventory;

   •     provides a route management system for coordinating the logistics of our direct store delivery program; and

   •     tracks all production activities at greenhouses, including sowing, spacing, dumping, spraying, picking and packing, using

          hand held

          devices.

  

We also use our GreenThumb software to help monitor the quality of our products, and we have dedicated quality assurance and quality control personnel that check and monitor our products. We have customer service personnel that answer any questions the consumers of our products may have, and we regularly ask for feedback from our customers on the quality of our products. The combination of the GreenThumb software, quality assurance and control processes (including compliance with food safety standards), and feedback from consumers and purchasers holds us accountable for maintaining the quality of our herbs and lettuce.

 

We focus our efforts on producing our herbs and vegetables in a sustainable manner that will reduce consumption of natural resources, by recycling water in our closed loop system and using LED lights instead of conventional lightbulbs to accelerate crop growth and yield, when necessary. In addition, the inventory management component of GreenThumb allows us to manage inventory levels, order quantities and fill rates while maximizing truck loads. This means that we are better able to control shipping our products in full truck loads, thus eliminating multiple deliveries and decreasing the excess emission of greenhouse gases that would result from many partially full trucks delivering our products. Together, these elements of our production and distribution process are intended to reduce our carbon footprint, or the total amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by our actions, as compared with a legacy farm business.

 

 

                                                                   23



Table of Content

  

We believe our focus on our brand “Edible Garden” is a significant differentiator. The brand not only lends itself to our current portfolio of products but allows us to develop other products in the “Consumer Brands” category. Our focus on sustainability, traceability, and social contribution, which we define as an ongoing effort to improve employee relations, working conditions, and local communities, presents our value proposition to our customers and supermarket partners and distributors. 

 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

 

Departure of Chief Financial Officer

  

Effective January 25, 2024, Michael James retired from his positions as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Company. In connection with Mr. James’s retirement, on January 24, 2024, the Company and Mr. James entered into a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr. James a severance payment of $300,000 in the form of salary continuation until January 2025. In addition, Mr. James is eligible to earn milestone payments under the Separation Agreement in an aggregate amount up to $300,000 if he completes certain transitional deliverables for the Company. The Company granted Mr. James a restricted stock award with a fair value equal to $25,000 as of April 2, 2024. 

 

Equity Distribution Agreement

 

On February 6, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “EDA”) with Maxim Group LLC, as sales agent (the “Agent”), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock through the Agent in an at-the-market offering for an aggregate offering price of up to $1,146,893. To date, the Company has received net proceeds of $1.1 million after deducting the Agent’s commission of 3.5% of the gross proceeds and other offering expenses from the sale of 181,710 shares of common stock under the EDA.

 

Supply Agreements

 

On February 8, 2024, the Company and Meijer Distribution, Inc. (“Buyer”) entered into two agreements pursuant to which the Company will supply and sell products to Buyer until December 2026 (the “Supply Agreements”). Under the Supply Agreements, the Company will sell (i) fresh cut herbs, including basil, bay leaves, chives, cilantro, dill, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme; (ii) hydroponic basil; and (iii) potted herbs, including basil, chives, cilantro, mint, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, wheatgrass; in quantities and delivery schedule requested by the Buyer at prices per unit set in advance. Under the Supply Agreements, the Company and the Buyer will renegotiate the prices for each unit annually, provided that the price per unit will not increase or decrease at a rate greater than the change in the relevant Consumer Price Index in that year. Once set, the pricing terms will remain fixed for the remainder of the year. Any price increases will take affect after sixty days and any price decrease will be effective immediately. If the Company and the Buyer are unable to mutually agree on price increases, the Company will have the power to terminate the Supply Agreements immediately.

 

Under the Supply Agreements, the Company agreed to fund the installation of fixtures in each of the Buyer’s stores to display potted herbs in an aggregate amount estimated to be $806,947. These payments will be made as a weekly deduction from the Company’s receivables from the Buyer. The Supply Agreements will expire on December 31, 2026. The Supply Agreements may be renewed for an additional two-year term upon the mutual agreement but may be terminated by the Buyer without cause upon sixty days’ prior notice.

 

 

                                                                   24

Cedar Cash Advance Agreement

 

On March 14, 2024, the Company entered into a standard merchant cash advance agreement (the “Advance Agreement” with Cedar Advance LLC (“Cedar”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell $1,491,000 of trade receivables to Cedar in exchange for $1,000,000 of cash proceeds, after deducting $50,000 for underwriting fees and other transaction expenses. On May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated standard merchant cash advance agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Cedar that amends and restates the Advance Agreement. Except as amended by the Restated Agreement, the remaining terms of the Advance Agreement remain in full force and effect. Under the Restated Agreement, the Company sold to Cedar an additional $994,000 of its future accounts receivable for a purchase price of $700,000, less aggregate fees and expenses of $87,500, for additional net funds provided of $544,250, bringing the total financing with Cedar to $2,485,000 in accounts receivable sold for $1,544,250 of net funds provided. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, the Company is required to pay Cedar 35.0% of all funds collected from customers for the sale of goods and services. Weekly, Cedar is authorized to withdraw $65,000 of funds from Edible Garden’s bank account until such time a reconciliation is provided calculating the 35.0% of collections owed to Cedar, until such time the total balance of $2,485,000 is repaid. The Restated Agreement is collateralized by the Company’s cash and receivable accounts. In the event of a default (as defined in the Restated Agreement), Cedar, among other remedies, can enforce its security interest in the collateral and demand payment in full of the uncollected amount of receivables purchased plus all fees due under the Restated Agreement.

 

Reverse Stock Split

 

As of April 5, 2024, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The conversion or exercise prices of our issued and outstanding stock options and warrants were adjusted in connection with the reverse stock split. 

 

Nasdaq Compliance

 

On April 11, 2024, we received letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we do not comply with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Rule”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), which requires us to have a minimum of 500,000 publicly held shares (the “Publicly Held Shares Rule”). These notices of noncompliance have no immediate impact on the continued listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq, which will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to our compliance with the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. By May 28, 2024, we must submit a plan to Nasdaq showing how we intend to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule. Because there are 549,392 shares of common stock outstanding as of May 6, 2024, (of which 3,360 are held by our officers and directors), we believe we are in compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule.

 

We intend to take all reasonable measures available to regain compliance under Nasdaq’s listing rules and remain listed on Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing. If we do not regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules within the time period permitted by Nasdaq, then our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq.

 

On April 19, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq indicating that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2). 

 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

 

The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, the relevant information available at the end of each period, and their judgment. Although management believes the judgment applied in preparing estimates is reasonable based on circumstances and information known at the time, actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or market conditions.

 

 

                                                                   25

The most significant accounting estimates involve a high degree of judgment or complexity. Management believes the estimates and judgments most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and to the understanding of our reported financial results include allowance for doubtful accounts. The following are the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

Revenues is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company does not offer returns, discounts, loyalty programs or other sales incentive programs that are material to revenue recognition. Payments from our customers are due upon delivery or within a short period after delivery.

 

Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

 

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our fixed assets, which are comprised of leasehold improvements, equipment and vehicles, have useful lives of five years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the asset lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations.

 

The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying balances of its property, equipment and leasehold improvements may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.

 

Income Taxes

 

The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return. The Company provides for income taxes based on enacted tax law and statutory tax rates at which items of income and expense are expected to be settled in our income tax return. Certain items of revenue and expense are reported for Federal income tax purposes in different periods than for financial reporting purposes, thereby resulting in deferred income taxes. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has incurred net operating losses for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, such net operating losses were offset entirely by a valuation allowance.

 

The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50.0% likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. The Company classifies income tax related interest and penalties as interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue

 

Revenue was $3.132 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.455 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in revenue of $677 thousand, or 27.6%, was primarily attributed to an increase in customer demand for our cut herbs and potted herbs products. Revenue from cut herbs increased from $412 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $997 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Revenue from potted herbs increased from $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $1.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in vitamins and supplements revenue of $190 thousand, from $589 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $399 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

  

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, total revenue was reduced by approximately $67 thousand as we adjusted the transaction price of our sales to a customer to account for funds we agreed to pay to the customer for the installation of fixtures in their stores. See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

  

Cost of goods sold

 

Cost of goods sold were $3.109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.479 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cost of goods sold increased $630 thousand, or 25.4%, in line with the increase in revenue for the same period. 

 

Selling, general and administrative

  

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $3.884 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.691 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. SG&A increased $1.193 million, or 44.3%, due to a one-time severance charge of $0.6 million and higher audit, accounting and legal fees related to the departure of our Chief Financial Officer.

   

Loss from operations

 

Higher SG&A expense resulted in a loss from operations of $3.861 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.715 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loss from operations was $1.146 million, or 42.2% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Interest expense

 

Interest expense was $117 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $234 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Lower interest expense was related to paying off debt previously outstanding with proceeds from public offerings.

  

Gain from extinguishment of debt

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized a gain from the extinguishment of debt of $70 thousand by prepaying a promissory note owed to our Predecessor company. 

 

Net loss

 

Net loss was $3.977 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.879 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The reasons for the increase in net loss are explained above. 

 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

Going Concern Considerations

 

We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We recognized net losses of approximately $3.977 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $10.188 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. We expect our capital expenses and operational expenses to increase in the future due to expected increased sales and marketing expenses, operational costs, and general and administrative costs. Therefore, we believe our operating losses will continue or even increase at least through the near term.

 

The risks and uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue our business with limited capital resources raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. Our financial statements have been prepared on a “going concern” basis, which implies we may not continue to meet our obligations and continue our operations for the next twelve months. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, holders of our securities might lose their entire investment. These factors, among others, may make it difficult to raise any additional capital and may cause us to be unable to continue to operate our business.

 

There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities by us would result in significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be unable to continue our business as planned and as a result may be required to scale back or cease operations, which could cause our stockholders to lose some or all of their investment in us. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Liquidity

 

The Company’s primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, continued investments in capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other strategic investments. Although income taxes are not currently a significant use of funds, after the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards are fully recognized, they could become a material use of funds, depending on our future profitability and future tax rates. The Company’s liquidity needs have been met primarily through public equity offerings, term loan borrowings, accounts receivable financing, convertible notes, and related party loans.

  

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $388 thousand and $510 thousand in cash and cash equivalents available, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we used $1.06 million of cash for operating activities. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $6.966 million and $257 thousand, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $5.290 million and $4.427 million of total debt outstanding, respectively. To meet our cash needs, we entered into the Advance Agreement and the Restated Agreement, raised approximately $1.1 million in an at-the-market offering and are implementing cost savings strategies. See “Capital Resources” below for additional details. 

  

 

                                                                   28



Table of Content

  

We may not be able to access the capital markets in the future on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures and our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial and other factors beyond our control, including those described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

 

Capital Resources

 

On February 6, 2024, we entered into the EDA with Maxim as sales agent, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock through Maxim in an at-the-market offering for an aggregate offering price of up to $1,146,893. To date, we have received net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million from the sale of common stock under the EDA after deducting Maxim’s commission of 3.5% of the gross proceeds and other offering expenses.

 

On March 14, 2024, we entered into the Advance Agreement with Cedar, pursuant to which we agreed to sell $1,491,000 of trade receivables to Cedar in exchange for $1,000,000 of cash proceeds, after deducting $50,000 for underwriting fees and other transaction expenses. On May 7, 2024, we entered into the Restated Agreement with Cedar, pursuant to which we sold Cedar an additional $994,000 of our future accounts receivable for a purchase price of $700,000, less aggregate fees and expenses of $87,500, for additional net funds provided of $544,250, bringing the total financing with Cedar to $2,485,000 in accounts receivable sold for $1,544,250 of net funds provided. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, we are required to pay Cedar 35.0% of all funds collected weekly from customers for the sale of goods and services. Weekly, Cedar is authorized to withdraw $65,000 of funds from our bank account until such time a reconciliation is provided calculating the 35.0% of collections owed to Cedar, until such time the total balance of $2,485,000 is repaid. The Restated Agreement is collateralized by our cash and receivable accounts. In the event of a default (as defined in the Restated Agreement), Cedar, among other remedies, can enforce its security interest in the collateral and demand payment in full of the uncollected amount of receivables purchased plus all fees due under the Restated Agreement.

 

For more information on our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Note 7 to our financial statements.

 

Cash Flows

 

Operating activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, cash used for operating activities was $1.059 million and $3.319 million, respectively. Cash expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased primarily due to a decrease in payments to vendors, higher collections and the impact of depreciation, offset by a higher operating loss.

 

 

                                                                   29



Table of Content

  

Investing activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities was $55 thousand and $361 thousand, respectively. The decrease was due to lower purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. 

 

Financing activities

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $992 thousand and $7.518 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by completion of the February 2023 public offering, which resulted in a net cash inflow after offering expenses of $9.26 million in the prior period. The decrease was offset by an increase in net proceeds from debt of $2.59 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 versus the prior period, as proceeds from debt issuances were higher and payments of debt principal were lower in the current versus the prior period. The decrease was also offset by $134 thousand of proceeds from the EDA, net of commissions.

 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were ineffective as of March 31, 2024, due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have yet to fully remediate.

 

Because we are a small company with few employees in our finance department, we lacked the ability to have adequate segregation of duties in the financial statement preparation process. Since these entity level controls have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. In addition, we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we lack maintenance of appropriate documentation to support our internal controls and we have insufficiently reviewed reports identifying user entity controls.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

 

                                                                   30

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

From time to time, we may be party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that there is any pending or threatened proceeding against us, which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should consider the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of these risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or the market price of our common stock. The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and/or operating results.

 

We are currently not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, our securities could be delisted, which could affect our common stock’s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.

 

On April 11, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we do not comply with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under the Stockholders’ Equity Rule because: (i) our stockholders’ equity was less than the required minimum of $2,500,000; and (ii) as of August 19, 2022, we did not meet the alternative compliance standards of market value of listed securities of $35 million or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years. As of March 31, 2024, our stockholders’ deficit is $4,088,000 and, we have not regained compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule.

 

In addition, on April 11, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule, which requires us to have a minimum of 500,000 publicly held shares. This notice of noncompliance has no immediate impact on the continued listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq, which will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to our compliance with the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. We have until May 28, 2024 to submit a letter to Nasdaq with our plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule and the Publicly Held Shares Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept our plan, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting, and we would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 

 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements would result in our common stock being delisted from Nasdaq, and if our common stock is delisted, our warrants will also be delisted. We and holders of our securities could be materially adversely impacted if our securities are delisted from Nasdaq. In particular:

 

     •    we may be unable to raise equity capital on acceptable terms or at all;

     •    we may lose the confidence of our customers, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our business as currently

           conducted;

     •    the price of our common stock will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with Nasdaq and

           the loss of federal preemption of state securities

           laws;

     •    holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so;

     •    we may become subject to stockholder litigation;

     •    we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our common stock;

     •    we may lose media and analyst coverage;

     •    our common stock could be considered a “penny stock,” which would likely limit the level of trading activity in the

           secondary market for our common stock;

           and

     •    we would likely lose any active trading market for our common stock, as it may only be traded on one of the over-the-counter

           markets, if at

           all.

  

 

                                                                   31
