Note 1 – Business Organization and Nature of Operations

 

Balance Labs, Inc. (“Balance Labs” or the “Company”) was incorporated on June 5, 2014, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Balance Labs is a consulting firm that provides business development and consulting services to start up and development stage businesses. The Company offers services to help businesses in various industries improve and fine tune their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal operations as well as make introductions to professional services such as business plan writing, accounting firms and legal service providers.

 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position of Balance Labs as of March 31, 2024, and the unaudited consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. It is recommended that these unaudited consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related disclosures of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2024.

 

Note 2 – Going Concern

 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company used $37,045 of cash in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and currently has $75,764 in cash as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, at March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,472,041 and a working capital deficit of $4,659,826.

 

There is substantial doubt about the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date of these financial statements were made available. The Company without additional sources of debt or equity capital would potentially need to cease operations. Management plans to seek to raise additional capital within the next twelve months that is expected to sustain its operations for the next year. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing. In addition, the Company expects to begin a marketing campaign to market and sell its services. There can be no assurance that such a plan will successful.

 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

 

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company has $2,000 in cash equivalents, respectively.

 

                                                                   8

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates may include those pertaining to stock-based compensation, depreciable lives of fixed assets and deferred tax assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

 

Accounts Receivable

 

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts pursuant to the guidance of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) as codified in Accounts Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. Under ASC 326, the Company utilizes a current and expected credit loss (CECL) impairment model. ASU 2016-13 became effective for us on January 1, 2023. The Company’s estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0 and $0 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company accounts for its revenues under FASB ASC 606, which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the five following criteria are met: (1) Identify the Contract with a Customer, (2) Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract, (3) Determine the Transaction Price, (4) Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations in the Contract, and (5) Recognize Revenue When (or As) the Entity Satisfies a Performance Obligation.

 

The Company recognizes consulting income when the services are performed, and performance obligations are satisfied over time or point of time.

 

Income Taxes

 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included or excluded in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

 

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

 

                                                                   9

As of March 31, 2024

(Unaudited)

 

Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no material tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date. The Company’s, 2021, 2022, and 2023 tax returns remain open for audit for Federal and State taxing authorities.

 

The Company’s policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest as interest expense and penalties as general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations.

 

Marketable Securities

 

The Company accounts for marketable and available-for-sale securities under ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.

 

The Company accounts for its investment in EZFill Holdings, Inc. as available-for-sale securities pursuant to the S-1 Registration Statement declared effective on September 14, 2021, therefore, the unrealized gain (loss) on the available-for-sale securities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 has been recorded in Other Income.

 

At March 31, 2024, the Company owned 66,432 shares and the fair value of the investment in EZFill Holdings, Inc. was reported on the balance sheet as Investment at fair value - related party totaling $113,599 ($1.71/share). The Company recorded an adjustment of $5,687 for the three months ending March 31, 2024, as unrealized gain on securities. EZFill Holdings Inc. reported a 1 share for 8 share reverse stock split on April 26, 2023, which affected the total number of shares reported as of March 31, 2024.

 

                                                                   10

Investments – Related Parties

 

When the fair value of an investment is indeterminable, the Company accounts for its investments that are under 20% of the total equity outstanding using the cost method. For investments in which the Company holds between 20-50% equity and is non-controlling are accounted for using the equity method. For any investments in which the Company holds over 50% of the outstanding stock, the Company consolidates those entities into their consolidated financial statements herein.

 

The Company holds one investment as of March 31, 2024, and one investment as of December 31, 2023.

 

Investments

 

On January 29, 2021, the Company received 20% ownership of Pharmacy No, 27, Ltd, a company based in Israel, as part of a Note Receivable from a third party. As of March 31, 2024, the investment has a fair value of $0, based upon the quoted closing trading price and it is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet using the equity method. During each three months ended March 31, 2024 the Company recorded $0 of unrealized loss from this investment.

 

Concentration of Credit Risk

 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of marketable securities was $113,599 and $107,912, respectively. The securities are included in the Investment at Fair Value – Related Party on the consolidated balance sheets, which consist of common shares held in one (1) investment which currently is trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB).

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly owned corporate subsidiaries, Balance Labs LLC.

 

                                                                   11

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

 

Basic and diluted income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and warrants from convertible debentures outstanding during the periods. The effect 3,698,494 and 3,698,494 shares from convertible notes payable for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

 

Stock-Based Compensation

 

The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.

 

The Company has computed the fair value of warrants granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for warrants is the contractual life. Since the Company’s stock has not been publicly traded for a sufficiently long period, the Company is utilizing an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being valued, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

 

We adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

 

●    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

      

●    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for

      similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that

      are not

      active.

 

                                                                   12

●    Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions

      developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would

      use.

 

The following table presents certain assets of the Company’s measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheet on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of March 31, 2024.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

The Company has evaluated all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 

In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company evaluated the impact of this standard on its financial statements and no adjustment is necessary.

Overview

 

We were incorporated on June 5, 2014, under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a consulting firm that provides business development and consulting services to start-up and development-stage companies. Our business model is to provide businesses in various industries with customized consulting services to meet their business needs and help them improve their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal operations, as well as introduce these businesses to experienced professional contacts that would be vital to the success of these companies.

 

The Company is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) and does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. The Company is not managed like an active investment vehicle, is not an investment company registered under the 1940 Act and is not required to register under the 1940 Act.

 

Additionally, in accordance with the 1940 Act, Section 3(c)(1), the Company is not an Investment Company as defined by the 1940 Act because the Company does not have outstanding securities beneficially owned by more than one hundred persons and, at this time, the Company is not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities. Additionally, the Company has not and has no plans to purchase or acquire any securities issued by any registered investment company.

 

                                                                   18

 

 

Our business focuses on providing advisement services to entrepreneurs and assisting business owners so that their ideas can be fully developed and implemented. Due to limited resources, lack of experienced management and competing priorities, start-up and developmental stage companies are not operating as efficiently as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could assist in developing and executing certain strategies. We utilize our knowledge in developing businesses, share practical experiences with our clients and introduce the business owners to experienced professionals who could help these inexperienced entrepreneurs further implement their ideas. Start-ups and development stage businesses across all industries commonly experience these certain “growing pains”.

 

Plan of Operations

 

Our plan is to prepare our clients for the many inevitable challenges they will encounter and to develop a customized plan for them to overcome these obstacles, so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s) to their potential customers.

 

Although we’ve only worked with three clients since inception, our goal is to add and service a minimum of two to three new clients between now and the end of 2024. We’re marketing our services through both personal contact and online by (a) mining our existing network of professional contacts via personal outreach programs, which will also target international prospects that may wish to enter the US market; (b) expanding our network by attending targeted conferences and professional gatherings; and (c) utilizing our website at www.balancelabs.co, plus engaging potential clients on social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. However, because we have a limited budget allocated for an on-line marketing campaign, we anticipate that professionals within our professional network and personal referrals from companies that are satisfied with our professional services are likely to be our most significant and efficient near-term form of marketing.

 

We believe that we can support our clients with our existing full-time staff, supplemented with part-time sub-contracted professionals and service providers, as necessary. Between now and the end of 2023, we intend to formalize our relationships with these subcontractors so that we can offer our clients turn-key business development products and services.

 

Our primary requirement for funding is for working capital in order to accommodate temporary negative cash flows from operations (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Availability of Additional Funds

 

Except for the monthly consulting fee to our CEO and Chairman of the Board and the monthly lease of our virtual office, as described elsewhere in this annual report, we currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. We are actively pursuing new client relationships. Even if we were to add a new client(s), due to our current lack of a diversified client base, there could be temporary imbalances between cash receipts and cash operating expenditures, which means that we may need additional capital. The engagement revenues associated with most client engagements will self-fund the in-house and sub-contractor services we need in order to supply products and services to our clients.

 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $4,659,826. The Company used cash in operations of $37,045. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while it continues to make changes in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position.

 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

 

We experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, in the amount of $37,045 and $14,246, respectively. This was primarily due to a net loss of $116,943 primarily offset by an unrealized gain on the value of an investment by $5,687, change in accounts payable and accrued expenses by $82,751, and amortization of debt discount $2,834.

 

                                                                   23

 

 

Our Auditors Have Issued a Going Concern Opinion

 

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as of March 31, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt from the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 

The Company anticipates the receipt of funding within such period, but there can be no assurance that it will occur. If the Company is unable to meet its internal revenue forecasts or obtain additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately it could be forced to discontinue the Company’s operations, liquidate, and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 

Use of Estimates

 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates may include those pertaining to accruals, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

 

                                                                   24

 

 

Revenue Recognition

 

The Company accounts for revenues under FASB ASC 606, which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the five following criteria are met: (1) Identify the Contract with a Customer, (2) Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract, (3) Determine the Transaction Price, (4) Allocate the Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations in the Contract, and (5) Recognize Revenue When (or As) the Entity Satisfies a Performance Obligation.

 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

 

We adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

 

●    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

      

●    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for

      similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that

      are not

      active.

      

●    Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions

      developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would

      use.

 

                                                                   25

 

 

Recent Accounting Standards

 

We have implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

 

In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements

 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

 

Not applicable.

 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

The Company’s assessment identified certain material weaknesses, (i)

 

functional controls, (ii) lack of audit committee and (iii) segregation of duties

 

Because of the Company’s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.

 

The Company does not have an audit committee and therefore there is no independent review and independent oversight over the Company’s financial reporting.

 

There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter at end of the fiscal year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.

 

Accordingly, as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.

 

                                                                   26

 

 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size. Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial actions upon receiving funding for the Company’s business operations.

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report herein.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
