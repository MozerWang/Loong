BASANITE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN

 

(A) Description of Business

 

Basanite, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “Basanite”, “we”, “us”, “our” or similar terminology), through our wholly owned subsidiary, Basanite Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BI”), manufactures a range of “green” (environmentally friendly), sustainable, non-corrosive, lightweight, composite products used in concrete reinforcement by the construction industry. Our core product is BasaFlex™, a basalt fiber reinforced polymer reinforcing bar (“rebar”) which we believe is a stronger, lighter, sustainable, non-conductive and corrosion-proof alternative to traditional steel.

 

Our two other main product lines are BasaMix™, which are fine denier basalt fibers available in various sizes, and BasaMesh™, a line of Basalt Geogrid Mesh Rolls, intended to replace welded wire mesh (made of steel) and other fiber reinforced polymer (“FRB”) grids and mesh.

 

BasaMix™ is designed to help absorb the stresses associated with early-aged plastic shrinkage and settlement cracking in concrete, as well as providing an increased toughness for enhanced reinforcement in Slab-on-Grade ("SOG”) and precast elements. BasaMix™ also serves in a “system approach” for optimum performance of a concrete element when used in conjunction with our BasaFlex™ rebar.

 

BasaMesh™ is designed for secondary and temperature shrinkage reinforcement. BasaMesh™ can also work in conjunction with the BasaFlex™ rebar or BasaMix™ for a total reinforcement program.

 

Each of our products is specifically designed to extend the lifecycle of concrete products by eliminating “concrete spalling.” Spalling results from the steel reinforcing materials embedded within the concrete member rusting (contrary to popular belief, concrete is porous and water can permeate into concrete). Rusting leads to the steel expanding and eventually causing the surrounding concrete to delaminate, crack, or even break off, resulting in potential structural failure. We believe that each Basanite product addresses this important need along with other key requirements in today’s construction market.

 

(B) Liquidity and Management Plans

 

Since inception, the Company has incurred net operating losses and used cash in operations. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company reported:

 

        •   an accumulated deficit of $56.6 million and $56.3 million;

 

        •   a working capital deficiency of $7.8 million and $7.6 million; and

 

        •   cash used in operations of $129.4 thousand

 

Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for product research and development and for marketing of the Company’s products; including the general and administrative expenses associated with the organization.

 

While we have generated relatively little revenue to date, revenue from sales of product began to increase in the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and we continue to receive inquiries and solicit orders from a range of customers for our products, indicating what we believe is a significant level of market interest for BasaFlex™. While the Company expects to expand its manufacturing capacity during 2025, based on our current limited manufacturing capacity there is no guarantee that orders will actually be received or that orders, if received, can be properly fulfilled.

 

 

                                                                   6

                                         NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

                                                              (UNAUDITED)

                                                                    

 

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN (CONTINUED)

 

We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of restricted common stock of the Company, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), and the issuance of warrants to purchase Common Stock and promissory notes. Until we are able to internally generate meaningful revenue and positive cash flow, we will attempt to fund working capital requirements through third party financing, including through potential private or public offerings of our securities as well as bridge or other loan arrangements. However, a number of factors continue to hinder the Company’s ability to attract new capital investment. We cannot provide any assurances that the required capital will be obtained at all, or that the terms of such required capital may be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may reduce our operating activities to reduce our cash use until sufficient funding is secured. If we are unable to secure funding when needed, our results of operations may suffer, and our business may fail.

 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

 

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

(A) Use of Estimates in Financial Statements

 

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Stock-based compensation and stock awards related to convertible debt instruments are recognized based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each award or conversion feature is typically estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying Common Stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our Common Stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our Common Stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.

 

The Company used the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of the warrants and options issued, using the following key assumptions for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 

(C) Cash

 

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company “("FDIC") up to $250,000. The Company’s credit risk in the event of failure of these financial institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management monitors the financial institutions credit worthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk. The Company from time to time may have amounts on deposit in excess of the insured limits.

 

(D) Inventories

 

The Company’s inventories consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, both purchased and manufactured. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Raw materials inventory consists of basalt fiber and other necessary elements to produce the basalt rebar. On a quarterly basis, the Company analyzes its inventory levels and records allowances for inventory that has become obsolete and inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value. The Company had no inventory as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 

(I) Revenue Recognition

 

We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expected to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The timing of revenue recognition largely is dependent on shipping terms. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board (“FOB”) shipping point. For sales transactions designated FOB destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site.

 

All revenues recognized are net of trade allowances, cash discounts, and sales returns. Trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been immaterial for each of the reported periods. Shipping and handling amounts billed to a customer as part of a sales transaction are included in revenues, and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity, rather than a promised service, and therefore is not considered a separate performance obligation. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred shipping and handling costs in the amount of $6,340 and $8,355, respectively.

On August 3, 2020, the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note to certain investors in exchange for $ 1,000,000 in the aggregate bearing an interest rate of 20% per annum and payable in 6 months. The holder may convert the unpaid principal balance of the note into shares of restricted Common Stock at the conversion price equal to $0.275 per share, which conversion price was set with the consummation of the Company’s private placement of Units which closed on August 17, 2021. This note contains a negative covenant that requires the Company to obtain consent prior to incurring any additional equity or debt investments and is secured by all of the assets of the Company. The Richard A. LoRicco Sr. and Lucille M. LoRicco Irrevocable Insurance Trust DTD 4/28/95, Louis Demaio as Trustee (the “Trust”) is the holder of $ 750,000 of the principal amount of this note. The Trust was created by Richard A. LoRicco Sr. and Lucille M. LoRicco, who were the parents of Ronald J. LoRicco Sr., one of the members of the Company’s Board of Directors and is maintained by an independent trustee. Ronald J. LoRicco Sr. does not have voting or investment control of or power over the Trust but is an anticipated, partial beneficiary of the Trust.

 

On February 12, 2021, the Company exchanged the original debt for a newly issued amended and restated secured convertible promissory note with a new principal balance of $1,610,005 bearing an interest rate of 20% per annum and fully payable in 3 months. This was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the new promissory note was recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 470 “Debt”. The original principal of $1,000,000 and accrued interest of $110,005 calculated as of the date of amendment and restatement along with an additional advance of $500,000 determined the principal amount of the new note. In consideration of the additional advance and the extension of the maturity date of the original note, the Company issued to the noteholders 5-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.20 per share. The issuance of the warrants for the extension generated a loss on extinguishment of $3,686,123 for the fair value of the warrants issued.

NOTE 7 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

The Company is the obligor under certain promissory notes that are currently past due (although formal events of default have not been declared).

 

See notes 4 and 5.

 

The Company is presently in default of its obligations under the terms of the Company’s private placement which closed in August 2021 to file a registration statement for an underwritten public offering and concurrently listing on a national stock exchange. As a result, the Company is required to pay liquidated damages in the amount of $53,345 per month starting in March 2022, and the maximum amount of such liquidated damages could be approximately $480,000 if such filing is not made.

 

On August 17, 2021, the Company conducted the closing of a private placement offering to accredited investors of the Company’s units at a price of $0.275 per unit, with each unit consisting of: (i) one share of the Company’s common stock, (ii) a five-year, immediately exercisable warrant (“Warrant A”) to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.33 per share and (iii) an additional five-year, immediately exercisable warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.33 per share (“Warrant B”). The Warrant A and Warrant B are identical, except that the Warrant B has a call feature in favor of the Company, as defined in the offering agreements. In connection with the closing, the Company entered into definitive securities purchase agreements with 19 accredited investors and issued an aggregate of 19,398,144 shares of common stock, Warrant A to purchase up to an aggregate of 19,398,144 shares of common stock, and Warrant B to purchase up to an aggregate of 19,398,144 shares of Common Stock (for an aggregate of 38,796,288 Warrant Shares), for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $5,334,490. Costs of the offering in the amount of $611,603 were charge to additional paid in capital. As of December 31, 2022 the Company also accrued the amount of $386,759 as liquidated damages due to the investors in the Company’s August 2021 private placement, such liquidated damages being related to the Company’s failure to timely file a registration statement on Form S-1 for an underwritten public offering and concurrent listing of the Common Stock on a national exchange.

 ITEM 2.              MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  

This overview provides a high-level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Annual Report in Form-10-K for the period ended December 31, 2032 and filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024.

 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). These forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs, assumptions, and expectations and on information currently available to our management. Generally, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address operating or financial performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements, including without limitation our expectations with respect to the timing for our planned manufacturing expansion, the benefits of our products, customer leads, product sales, financings, or the commercial viability of, and prospects for, our business model. We may not actually achieve the plans, projections or expectations disclosed in forward-looking statements, and actual results, developments or events (including, without limitation, those related to our planned manufacturing capacity expansion and our sales and marketing initiatives) could differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements. Our management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they speak only as of the date when made. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by federal securities laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We may not actually achieve the plans, projections or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and actual results, developments or events could differ materially and adversely from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC.

 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the risk factors and other disclosures contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023.

 

Basanite, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries are referred to in this discussion as the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”. “Common stock” refers to the common stock of the Company.

 

Overview

 

On May 30, 2006, Basanite, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Basanite Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BI”), we manufacture a range of “green” (environmentally friendly), sustainable, non-corrosive, lightweight, composite products used in concrete reinforcement by the construction industry. Our core product is BasaFlex™, a basalt fiber reinforced polymer reinforcing bar (“rebar”) which we believe is a stronger, lighter, sustainable, non-conductive and corrosion-proof alternative to traditional steel.

 

Our two other main product lines are BasaMix™, which are fine denier basalt fibers available in various chopped sizes, and BasaMesh™, a line of Basalt Geogrid Mesh Rolls, intended to replace welded wire mesh (made of steel) and other fiber reinforced polymer grids and mesh.

 

BasaMix™ is designed to help absorb the stresses associated with early-aged plastic shrinkage and settlement cracking in concrete, as well as providing an increased toughness for enhanced reinforcement in Slab on Grade (SOG) and precast elements. BasaMix™ also serves in a “system approach” for optimum performance of a concrete element when used in conjunction with our BasaFlex™ rebar.

 

BasaMesh™ is designed for secondary and temperature shrinkage reinforcement. BasaMesh™ can also work in conjunction with the BasaFlex™ rebar or BasaMix™ for a total reinforcement program.

 

Each of our products is specifically designed to extend the lifecycle of concrete products by eliminating “concrete spalling.” Spalling results from the steel reinforcing materials embedded within the concrete member rusting (contrary to popular belief, concrete is porous, and water can permeate into concrete). Rusting leads to the steel expanding and eventually causing the surrounding concrete to delaminate, crack, or even break off, resulting in potential structural failure. We believe that each of our products addresses this important need along with other key requirements in today’s construction market.

 

                                                                  16 



                                                         

 

We believe that the following attributes of BasaFlex™ provide it with a competitive advantage in the marketplace:

 

        •       BasaFlex™ never corrodes: steel reinforcement products rust, leading to spalling and significant repair costs down the

                 road;

 

        •       BasaFlex™ is sustainable: BasaFlex™ is made from Basalt rock, the most abundant rock found on Earth’s surface, and

                 offers a longer product lifecycle than traditional steel (the lack of corrosion allows the life span of concrete

                 products reinforced with BasaFlex to be significantly

                 longer);

 

        •       BasaFlex™ is “green”: From mining, through production, to installation at the building site, BasaFlex™ has an

                 exceptionally low carbon footprint when compared with that of steel;

                 and

 

        •       BasaFlex™ has a lower in-place cost: the physical nature of our products relative to steel result in a lower net cost

                 to the contractor once installed, such as: BasaFlex™ is one-quarter of the weight of equivalent sized steel, meaning

                 4 times the quantity of material can be delivered by the same truck (or container); all Basanite products can be

                 loaded/unloaded and moved around the jobsite by hand – no expensive handling equipment is needed; less concrete is

                 required as BasaFlex™ does not require the extra concrete cover needed when using steel; and Basanite products are

                 safer and easier to use. We believe all these factors materially reduce the net in-place cost of concrete

                 reinforcement.

 

 

We believe that macroeconomic factors are pressuring the construction industry to consider the use of alternative reinforcement materials for the following reasons:

 

        •       the increasing need for global infrastructure repair;

 

        •       recent design trends towards increasing the lifespan of projects and materials;

 

        •       the global interest in promoting the use of sustainable products; and

 

        •       increasing consideration of both the long-term costs and environmental impacts of material selections.

 

We believe we are well positioned to benefit from this renewed focus, particularly in light of the interest of the U.S. government in funding infrastructure improvements and events such as the collapse of a residential building in Surfside, Florida.

 

Inflation & Interest Rate Sensitivity

 

In the past fiscal years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. However, during the second half of 2021, throughout 2022 and into 2023, the U.S. economy has entered into a period of increasing inflation. Should inflation persist or increase, interest rates rise and could have a significant effect on the economy in general and, thereby, could affect prices for raw materials we use, demand for our products, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor and our future operating results.

 

Supply Chain

 

In the past year, supply chain shortages or delays have had an immaterial impact on our operations. Our raw material suppliers have maintained a consistent flow of goods which we receive monthly. Domestic suppliers have increased their in-stock flows to maintain adequate levels with our manufacturing needs. However, we might experience supply chain challenges in the future, which could harm our business and our results of operations.

 

War in Ukraine

 

The recent war in Ukraine has led the world to issue sanctions on the government of Russia. This has shut down our ability to procure basalt fiber material from our secondary supplier, UWF/Kamenny Vek. However, our primary supplier, Mafic, is U.S. based, and has ample capacity to support our current and anticipated future needs with 100% domestic source of raw materials. We have also recently increased the levels of our safety stock of raw materials as an additional cushion. Nonetheless, we are currently qualifying alternate material from other suppliers to preserve our options in case of further disruptions.

 

Government Approvals and Specifying of our Products

 

We continue to pursue additional product and facility qualifications and approvals, and these qualifications and approvals are critical to the market acceptance of our products. BI is currently testing products at two independent laboratories and received ICC-ES certification, which was granted in the second quarter of 2023, and a Florida Department of Transportation (“FDOT”) production facility and product approval, which was also granted in the second quarter of 2023 (we are already selling to FDOT projects on an individual basis through exemptions or specs). The FDOT approval will allow us to bid on any project approved for BFRP. We anticipate that with these two approvals the prospects of new projects will increase.

 

                                                                  17 



                                                         

 

Results of Operations

 

Revenue: We had revenue of $59,449 from sales of finished goods for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $115,118 in the prior year. While the decrease in revenue in the year-over-year periods was relatively significant due to our manufacturing constraints and limited working capital.

 

Cost of goods sold: During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had cost of sales of $4,258 compared to $19,751 in the prior year. We lost money on a gross margin basis due to normal inefficiencies in the start-up and ramping and scaling process, including limited initial sales volume, and further due to extremely narrow margins on the initial sales of our products as we began introducing them to the marketplace as well as limited manufacturing capabilities.

 

Operating Expenses

 

Sales, General, and Administrating Expenses: During the three months ended March 31, 2023, selling, general, and administrative were $129,071 compared to $429,714 in the prior year. The primary components of selling, general, and administrative expenses were as follows:

 

Payroll and related costs: During the three months ended March 31, 2024, payroll and related costs were $45,463 compared to $124,793 in the prior period. The decrease was due to the reduction of staff in 2023. The Company expects to return to a fully staffed operation by year end 2025.

 

Consulting fees: During the three months ended March 31, 2024, consulting fees were $0 compared to $49,615 in the prior period. The Company utilized financial consultants in the prior period in connection with its equity financing, management of the Company and fundraising.

 

Legal fees: During the three months ended March 31, 2023, legal fees were $36,235 compared to $6,155 in the prior period. Legal fees increased primarily due to ongoing matters in the current period.

 

Accounting and audit fees: During the three months ended March 31, 2024 accounting and audit fees were $30,000 compared to $22,155 in the prior period. Accounting and audit fees consisted of annual audit fees and the cost of outside consultants in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

Since inception, we have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flow. As of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $56,525,090. We have incurred general and administrative expenses associated with our product development and compliance while concurrently setting up our manufacturing facility, beginning operations, and developing our business plan. We also continue to incur legal fees arising from ongoing activities due to fundraising. We expect operating losses to continue in the short term, and we require additional financing for expanding our manufacturing capability and generally scaling our business until we can generate sufficient revenues to achieve positive cash flow. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

 

We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of restricted common stock and the issuance of warrants and promissory notes. We will continue our fundraising efforts until we have obtained positive cash flow to cover our expenses. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising capital at all or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and no assurances can be given that even if we raise capital that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to be cash flow positive.

 

Notwithstanding proceeds from the sale of our securities, a recent related party equipment lease transaction and warrant and option exercises in 2022 and 2023, current working capital is very limited and our projected sales revenue (together with our limited working capital) are presently insufficient to maintain our current operations. In order to grow our manufacturing and sales and marketing operations and reach the level of revenue sufficient to provide positive cash flow, we require significant funding of both our expansion plans (which includes the finalization of our current manufacturing expansion plans and potential investments in other manufacturing facilities, as well as increased headcount necessary to operate our manufacturing at planned capacity) as well as our significant operating deficit while we seeking to scale our manufacturing capability, secure orders from known potential customers and introduce our products to new customers. We will attempt to raise this capital through third party financing, including potential private or public offerings of our securities (including a potential underwritten offering and uplist to a national exchange) as well as bridge or other loan arrangements. However, there is a material risk that we will be unable to secure required capital (whether through an underwritten uplist financing or otherwise) at all or that the terms of such required financing may be available or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may reduce our operating activities to reduce our cash use until sufficient funding is secured. If we are unable to secure funding when needed, our results of operations may suffer, and our business may fail.

 

                                                                  18 



                                                         

 

Cash Flows

 

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities amounted to $1,148,247 and 1,859,981 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily a result of an decrease in operational activities.

 

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we used $450,000 net cash for investing activities compared to $900,000 used in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is largely due to costs associated with the operational activities of day-to-day activities.

 

We do not believe that our cash on hand as of March 31, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our current working capital requirements to the point where we are generating positive cash flow. We have recently entered into several convertible promissory notes to help fund operations and will require additional working capital in the short term. We continue working towards securing more working capital with a preference towards debt which may be convertible to equity. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts or, if we are, that the terms will be beneficial to our shareholders.

 

Critical Accounting Estimates

 

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Please see note 2 to the condensed financial statements included in this report. 

 

 ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.

 

 ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Acting Interim Chief Executive Officer and our Acting Interim Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) through March 31, 2024.

 

During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control as of March 31, 2024, management identified material weaknesses related to (i) the U.S. GAAP expertise and experience of our internal accounting personnel and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control  was not effective as of March 31, 2024.

 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that the material weaknesses described above are remediated as soon as possible. We believe we will have the opportunity to remediate these weaknesses when adequate funding is secured. We will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.

 

Because of its inherent limitations, however, readers are cautioned that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
